This is the Best review of anything i have ever seen Fantastic video man,
Im guessing these phones will start on fire when they get to hot just like galaxy sevens,
damn this review is high quality,
I liked the vibe of this video nothing like iPhone 7 is the best Period so I can appreciate that,
sammy RULEZ,
Best iPhone 7 review out there,
When you have an aux cord but you got an iPhone 7,
Condescendingly watching on my beautiful S7,
Ima wait for the real review mkbhd,
now THIS is a good review Since the release most reviewers are still pro Crapple you can the this was an impartial review also the host is cool,
I liked the iPhone 6 space grey design more,
Great review thanks I am a huge Apple fan and I am really disappointed about this release,
Meanwhile Im still using a 5S,
Sounds like a honest review Definitely not worth a upgrade,
If Apple adds led notification lightring or always on display IR blaster back button and can still keep the OS smooth and pretty much lag freebest phone in existence but if you know Apple thatll never happen,
*gorgeous displays*ahahaahahaha  v,
People should just wait for the 10th Anniversary series of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus8s in 2017 Not worth buying the 7 They didnt even really do anything that different with this seriesPASS,
Everyday I wake up to the best phone in the business s6 edge plus Ill wait for the hate,
3543 emails Jeez man,
Just ordered the iPhone 7 Plus I cant wait to get it ,
One of THE best reviews done by The Verge Keep it up guys,
Get rid of the taptic engine and you have room for 5 headphone jacks,
They say the next Iphone will be big cause the 10 years Anniversary versionso I will wait D,
The 7S should come with two lightning ports,
ripapple,
Apple no longer innovates correctly,
I wish reviewers would be more specific about battery use 810 hours a day can either be incredible if you mean screen on time or dismal if you mean total use Which one is it,
Im still happy with my original 6,
The iPhone 7 is definitely worth the upgrade The world isnt ready for it Get the hell out of here lol The Verge Also poo pooing the most important and least talked about component of why Apples hardware is always a step ahead  engineering The meshing of hardware and software Every year the iPhones camera consistently beats out other smartphones in blind tests Except for camera specific feature phones etc No one else can duplicate what Apple does Thats a tough pill for many to swallow And that doesnt mean that there arent GREAT competitors either,
A B E F G H J L M O P Q R T U W X Y Z Notice anything D I C K S are out for Harambe,
I love when people make the argument that the iPhone is way overpriced but then they go out and buy a Note 7 for 800,
The Taptic Engine for home button with 3 levels of adjustment is just for the vibration Instead Apple should have levels of sensitivity That would have been more useful,
Love your accent Nilay,
At least iPhone 7 doesnt explode,
Great Video Youre very good at editing,
It would be awesome if everyone could just have one,
The 6s is better imo,
Wow 1K thumbsdown already Thats because you assume too much during the review More details and even more facts man Dont sound too general in your discussion Good luck,
Everybody loves a bigger blacker phone Especially my wife,
I kind like the other guys iPhone review betterI forget his name,
over exposed iphone7 in low light Note 7 looks super natural easy to make it brighter post without over exposing the candels,
Hey Verge Terrific review,
This reviewer is a REAL ONE I cant express how refreshing it is to have a reviewer that isnt bias  brainwashed,
Youre pretty much saying that you think its too advanced for this gen but its not If Apple wanted to throw all they have and put all their efforts into a phone then yes it would but theyre not doing that Theyre releasing already improved upon technology little by little just so suckers that feel a need to upgrade to the new iPhone because they think theyre cool throw more money at them Its a greedy company that has a lot more to offer than its letting on and its disappointing that they dont go all out,
great review you are good dude  i would get a note 7 as an iPhone 7,
Beautiful phone but l will just get the 6S not much difference,
samsung managed to get better water resistance with a headphone jack,
Definitely going to wait till next year to upgrade,
Thanks for confirming what I expected since the 7 was announced My perfectly running 6 should be good until the REAL upgrade comes out,
something tells me I should just wait for the iPhone 8 next year,
oh just exploding lmao,
hey guys  wich one is the best Iphone7 or LG G5,
The Verge is awesome,
I need to see a bend test for this Iphone,
Great production on this video Came across you from Mojo,
I have the 5s Any reasons to upgrade to 7 if screen size isnt an issue I dont know when the designs since the iphone 6 has become better because IMO the 5s design is so much better than 6 and beyond,
its like all the tech channels are racing who gets to review the iphone 7 first,
I actually like the iPhone 7s home button more than the previous ones,
When they hand you the aux cord but you using an IPhone 7,
Okay prepare 1000 dolars ,
apple released a 6Ss and 6Ss,
Damn Apple step up your game,
this review was awesome new subbie,
This is not biased at all Great review,
Did you have the dark mode on in the shots with iMessage I think they had it on the beta but I dont think it made it to the full version,
honestly im in to minds about it but it looks as though it would be good quality,
that early adopter life 606 Im not ready for kids,
I thought this was a college humor video for a second,
At 401 the iP6S photo is actually better,
so wouldnt it be the PHONE isnt ready for the world Were not the ones coming at this incomplete the phone is,
still a expensive over price POS and no I dont own a NOTE 7 typing from my LUMINA 950 XL,
532 you put them in the wrong ears unless the video is mirrored,
This is the best review Ive seen I knew I was going to get the 7 before watching this video bc I need a new phone but if I had a 6 or 6s and was deciding to upgrade or not this wouldve been very helpful,
Idk how you can fully review a phone when its only out this long,
So the airpod is included in the iphone 7s box package or not,
How much did Apple Pay you for this review,
Need to see a tear down,
people said the same thing when they introduced the lightning port,
i really believed that they would add wireless charging still cant believe they didnt ,
The iPhones audio sucks sometimes during calls tho,
i really want apple sales to decline this year nothing against apple but i dont want people to encourage this new so called innovation of removal of headphone jackbut i think isheep will follows as always,
Good review but Is rather have the S7 or Note 7 once they fix the explosion problem,
Damn no 64 gig,
I listened to this review with headphones in my headphone jack thats in my phone,
Ill help everyone here if you have a 6s or 6s plus wait till the 9 comes out if you have anything lower then 6 time to upgrade,
I was expecting much more from the iPhone 7 Im disappointed right now and I also need a new phone so Im gonna be changing to android now,
3543 unread emails just gave me anxiety,
iphone 7 or note 7  No exploding jokes plzz,
What he is saying is that Samsung is better,
I swear this guy loves to criticize,
Staff account fact proud cross strike,
Im totally not convinced losing the headphone jack is a problem because I havent gone out and spend 300 on a pair of headphones It was absolutely the right thing to do Frankly Im really shocked so many professional reviewers attack the development,
Patel bhai jordar ho baki,
iPhone 6s or note 7 I need a phone that has a good camera and lots of storage,
*cough* windows did taptic buttons alooooooonngggg time ago *cough*,
Im debating whether to get this or Samsung s7,
Why wasnt the galaxy 7 mentioned,
Actually if you check inside the phone the space where the headphone jack is seems to be to be replaced by the new home button feature,
I wanted to love the iPhone 7 when i first saw it unveil at the press conference I was really excited but I believe I will just skip a year and wait for the iPhone 7s and hope that a much bigger leap has been made,
Someone could snatch your wireless earphones in a snap and run away with your expensive earphones,
lefty hah,
This entire interview all I heard you saying all the features are good but not as good as Samsung,
What if I want to charge n listen to music,
No the red dot is to indicate you are richer then someone else as you have a more expensive watch,
oh man i really hate that red dot,
I dont think think that red dot in the Digital Crown was necessary,
Somehow Im more interested in the nail polishAnd Im a dude,
Awesome Now debt collectors will be able to reach me even when my phone battery dies Its not like anyone else ever calls me,
Nice nails,
Who wants to go into business with me selling aftermarket red crown stickers for old apple watches,
THAT APPLE WATCH IS T H I C C,
The main complaint with the original Apple Watch was that it was too thick since then theyve made it thicker,
Expensive watch with cheapest strap on it,
why this red dot thats just not the right aesthetic for apple,
I still think the design isnt very nice Its too thick It needs a new formfactor,
Anyone know if Siri talking back is an actual Series 3 feature or if it will also be for Series 2 watches that have the new OS4,
I just cant get past that horrible red dot Who designed that And who signed it off Its hideous,
Does it have a calculator app,
OK Managing to integrate LTE into basically the same form factor is an amazing feat of engineering but the red digital crown is extremely ugly Why would Apple do that,
So will the LTE give me wrist cancer,
Lauren where is your twin,
I dont get why people say its a to thick smartwatch I mean its 114 mm which is in regular watches quit thin My seiko automatik watch is the 13mm and is compared to other watch normal thickness and it wears perfectly fine so they could do it even thicker and it would be nowbig deal but on videos every watch looks so thick,
had to buy new sets of scrubs that had pant leg pockets with buttons cause my phone kept on falling out when i would sit to do paper work would accidentally leave phone everywhere sometimes toilet  patient rooms staff stations also would miss messages from department heads when im not physically holding phone this thing solves alot of my issues i shall investigate further,
310 Series 1 isnt the original Apple Watch tho,
Just in case folks dont see it yet we are coming to the end of smartphones as the heartbrain of the ecosystems,
Nike Band and Nike Nails nice combo ,
Lauren 3,
This is the best watch i ever seen,
So now with LTE the battery life can suck even more And I get a red dot so all my friends know that its a series 3 and not the series 2 Awesome Job Apple,
WOW The design is sooooo different that the Series 2 Seriously Appleyou just blew my mind ,
Samsung S3 Gear Frontier user Team here Im just curious,
still no sleep sensor eyeroll,
youre missing the 4k video,
Red Dot  Soviet  Russia OMG RUSSIA IS INVOLVED IN APPLE NOW,
Nice match color of the nails and watch band pity the color choice itself is rather tasteless Keep it up,
Thumbs up for not doing the whole schizophrenic twin thing anymore,
It doesnt work with TMobile FML,
I love the new bands they made it fitted so smooth and can fit any size perfectly,
The square screen makes it look so tacky and cheap Like the 2017 version of the calculator watch,
So no smart bands I keep my 1st gen Apple Watch,
Love her Voice Great First Look,
But if you watch the apple that means you need to blink,
i Watch 3,
Love your nails,
Cant wait till they add FaceTime on these things,
Could one get by with a Series 3 Watch  AirPods and no iPhone,
A E S T H E T I C,
Tracking features Tracking you Yep Pay for your own enslavement,
Does the volume go louder on the Series 3 than on the Series 2,
Damn That nailpaint looks beautiful on her,
Am so in love with apple series 3 too dopey,
The problem with the red crown is that it clashes with most bands Should have been far more subtle IMHO,
Just matter of time so we can move towards a life without phones Swart Watch will be one of the alternatives,
Love your voice,
apple forever incremental changes,
Thanks for the video But Im interested in that nail polishlolWhat color and brand is that Very pretty,
This is gonna hurt my wallet,
Velcro on an Apple Watch Bruh Id rather save for rent rather than buy that ,
I wear a G Shock,
Promise permanent mention thick resume distinction toilet refer deal mad,
*New launch product nickname The Wrist Brick*,
Unless its a redesign I think Ill pass on this I just got a series 2 not too long ago so theres no real reason to buy one,
No video streaming no deal,
Still rocking my series 1 Apple Watch,
Didnt used to do herpderp I talk gud,
Does anyone know the song used in the Apple Watch Series 3 Skateboard advert showcasing the music streaming,
I just got mine but it says Verizon doesnt support it so I have no lte for now,
I have only ONE question Can I use Viber app to call send videos and photos in it with or without the phone,
Watch 3 nice No comment on the battery life in the event  hmm The only con is the battery life and the annoying charging cycles The red dot does look a bit awkward well anyway Everything else is great,
Is rose gold no longer,
Was that man an employee,
I want This one,
if you dont know what LTE is you need to go back to school its 2017,
STILL no camera for FaceTime whack,
is series 1 still worth it,
Lawrun Gooooodeeee,
Like the nail polish color,
Series 1 is not the original Apple Watch  Series 1 has a better faster processor  Get ur facts right,
still no damn camera,
still is too THICK BIG FAT let me know in 3 years,
Finally I can buy Apple Watch series 1,
You forgot to mention that the watch can now stream music from Apple Music,
Beautiful hands,
In the category of innovation Steve Jobs would give this a 1 out of 10,
Look Stacey Malibu with a new hat,
This should be Apples main communicator device And the iPhone as a top tier photography device,
And my nails match the wrist band yayy,
Save your money this will not change your life ,
They just removed watch2 like that  Lolllll,
why dont you put more effort in making its battery life longer Apple,
That red dot helped my decision not to upgrade Theres no need to show others that your watch is LTE you know if you bought it,
I need this,
a 5th grader I know is getting one of these th,
How does de LTE works Can I use it in Guatemala,
No series 2 at all Kidding me,
Do you need a phone number for the Apple Watch LTE version,
Wow Matching nail polish your so Apple,
could her tone stress any harder how unimpressed she is,
3 watches later and it still looks exactly the same What a joke,
I was under the impression that the original Apple Watch was different than the series 1 Thats what the people at Apple told me It was original Apple Watch then series 12 and now 3 Am I wrong,
Just buy polar v800 if you need proper sport watch apple fitness aps are useless,
Thats why I need my pizza BONELESS,
Best item announced in the presentation,
What about battery life with the LTE it might drain the battery faster than the previous Series 2 no,
Ok so why hasnt any carrier released info on how much this will cost for the monthly LTE coverage,
So well see if the carriers make you pay for an added line since its LTE capable like they do the iPads,
Question for Series 1 and 2 Watch users Would you consider getting the 3,
Great review thanks,
So basically Its just a normal apple watch with lte,
No one cares about the Apple Watch features because the battery life is still the same,
Will the series 2 Siri talk to me on Watch OS 4,
These will be great for field journalism,
What there trying to say is WHO NEEDS A PHONE WHEN YOU HAVE A APPLE WATCH THAT DOES IT ALL,
Whatever Apple makespeople will continue to buy it This one will be no different,
Lmao whos gonna use the LTE and make calls with his wrist ,
I like that Apple likes having green everywhere,
Series 1 is not the first apple watch,
Choices Apple choices,
it doesnt look or feel thicker two sheets of paper lmao like omg silly marketing campaign Pick one Stopped watching at that point,
Now only 399,
*You know whats really cool A watch thats round*,
Lauren can WE have a relationship,
Do I have to get a separate data plan for the lte model,
Your nails look nice,
the watch is cool but her nails are really nice and well manicured,
Id happily just use the watch alone without the phone if possible,
Nail polish on point Nice color choice,
Will the w2 chip allow for instant paring like the AirPods,
Nice nail polish colour,
Fandroids more toxic than botulinum toxin,
The health and fitness aspects look awesome,
Does it cost extra to use LTE in your country Heard that i will cost some in UK,
1st generation rectangular 2nd generation rectangular 3rd generation rectangular seriously Is it too hard to make a round one that look more like a watch,
Yay So glad they added that red dot on the crown Now people will know that I got the future of watches on my wrist,
As expected incrediblerevolutionary device,
Pace whisper guard worry conservative carve afraid singer,
Take all of my money now Her is all my monies take Talk back to me Yes Maybe next year we can get a new color and I can buy another one Sweet,
Can you switch to a different paired device without doing a factory reset,
NiceVideoisubscribetoyou,
cool,
Why are people disliking,
Love it but battery recharge is critical I use wwwwiwarecom to keep charged,
Can I speak through the watch or not that is the difference I want to look like James Bond man,
Which one is better the 1 or the 3,
The question is can I use the Apple watch series 3 without owning an iPhone,
dead serious question what are the health risks associated with the LTE functionality its like holding a phone to your wrist 247 arent there some radiation side effects or something,
Absolutely useless in the UK unless you are on EE No Series 3 for me,
This needs a camera,
I honesty think this is a game changer The red looks dope The LTE is revolutionary,
I think apple watch is not worth any cent the design hasnt change scince the 1st Apple Watch the battery hasnt heard of any increment and they havent change a lot scince the first one So Ive always think Apple is staying behind in terms of adding new tech to their products they dont change that much scince the originial on my opinion,
Ffs make it round ,
After these years I still dont get smart watchesso unnecessary,
Right when I get a series 2 a series 3 comes out,
Can i replace my phone with applewatch with LTE,
Apple is just copying androids features and making it look better with their brand reputation come on amaze us in different way,
I would go for Omega,
HOLY CRAP RED CROWN  MIND BLOWN,
Why does the none UMTS Version not have ceramic on the back ,
So TWO aesthetic differences,
Why isit still so thicc Apple lost the plot,
Its insipid trash from Apple you dont even have enough battery for any MM Games etc Maybe they should run special power cables under the streets for them ,
Hello If I purchase an apple watch GPS in the US will it still work fine in the Philippines Considering the price difference from our apple store I would like to purchase one and have it delivered to my friend in Detroit Thanks in advance to those who will take time to read and answer this Happy New Year Cheers,
399 lte and more of a monthly payment for lte unless it just goes off your phone,
Samsung smart watch had LTE over 2 years ago Apple is just catching up nothing innovative about that,
I really dont like this woman she is quite annoying,
I really want to get this watch Havent worn a watch in years now Im ready for this,
They said the back ceramic panel is slightly thicker You were in the room,
That nail polish is fierce,
I WAMT IT SO BAD LIKE I WANT IT AS A GIFT,
la verga v,
Did they fix the battery life,
I loved those green nails,
Plus you need to pay for that data plan on the watch,
Wow lte for texting and calling,
Apple a b c,
Legit might not buy this cause of this stupid red dot,
The day theyll make the watch thinner ill buy it Especially than now it will have cellular,
crapalicious,
So how many devices do you have to charge per day ,
Moto 360 is better still rocking 1st gen,
I like Apple but the Apple watch is just horrible In my opinion,
I totally love that red dot,
Meh I will stay Seri 2 Watch,
The noncellular aluminum Apple Watch Series 3 is a slight downgrade because Apple took away the ceramic back and replaced it with a composite back to make it cheaper,
Really hate the red dot Love Lauren,
*WHY SO THICK*,
2 sheets of paper thiccer,
So how much is it with my cell phone carrier,
Since this is LTE can you add a wearable line to make and receive calls without your phone needing to be paired to it,
I was excited for this new watch and was considering getting the gold one but it looks like rose gold Well see how it looks when it comes,
What is the cost for this watch,
where can I get a red dot sticker for my watch,
How far can your phone be from your watch without the cellular,
apple watch is the king of smart watches 109268claimapplewatchcom,
Looks pretty neat there And now since watch 2 is not around you might want the cellular version but then again the cellular watch is not available in many countries Just restricted,
Smart Watches have turned into a wannabe techie fashion statement They wear them in an effort to say Hey Im up to date Im ahead of the curve But you dont see them running OS forks linux boxes or modifying code,
They seriously need to improve the battery life A watch you have to charge every day is a joke It was the biggest motivator for me to sell my Apple Watch series 1,
Will it need a sim card,
Dosent that mean that you would have to pay for a another line,
big fan of the new strap though,
This is worth it,
Not sure why they ditched Series 2 but still kept Series 1 which is an ancient piece of smart watch,
I hope there is a way to hide that red dot thingy Theres gotta be a way to mark it elsewhere man,
Though Im thinking with LTE added does that mean battery performance will be degraded,
I dont have tmobile in my country so its kinda irrelevant to play ads like that,
Hey Verge  is the battery any better ,
Can I buy,
it does not work without IPHON  iPhone 6 onwards require  check apple statement please,
How far the iphone and watch working,
Dots indicator here lines on the iPhones WTF apple,
Your weed os,
BAROMETER AND ALTIMETER This thing is getting closer to being an actual option for runners,
cellular how put a sim card,
Mam price,
if someone kidnaps you and takes your phone they probably wont think to take your watch and you use it to call the police,
theverge verge The series 1 is not the original Apple Watch version Series 1 and 2 have the same processors the original Apple Watch has a much slower processor and is categorized as 1st Gen,
Those nails are on point babe,
By the time you find the contract on the watch You can already get the person to answer by using your phone to call,
Price plz,
Price plz,
Price plz,
do we have to pay a monthly service,
your nail looks better than the apple watch strap,
I use my series 2 on runs and LTE addition is wonderful I hated not being able to text right after a run receiving texts during a run,
Pile of trash no camera no video whats the use lol,
I see a spike in sales of small red circular stickers,
Thats THICK,
so will it work with your existing plan or do you have to pay for another line,
Do people really hate that red dot that much I wouldnt really care Just sharpie over it lol,
Give it a glucometer and Ill become an Apple fanboy in an instant,
im using a MS band 2 right now I was about to buy apple watch 2 last month but I held out until the 3 came Ill be buying it asap,
The apple 2 is completely unavailable to buy now,
still not getting this ,
Why is cloning my own phone a felony but apple can clone its watch from my phone legally,
hate the red dot hate battery life still the same hate no sapphire glass option,
Can it store and play its own music,
Im thinking about getting a Apple Watch is series one different from series 3 I just want a Apple Watch nothing major please help,
I personally dont really like the red digital crown so thats y im getting the other series 3,
Nice nails  ,
Too bulky on the wrist,
How Lte works,
Leica has a red dot,
Not a watchtis a Gadget small mini phone on your wrist that becomes obsoleteoften,
It would be cool if ISPs would allow you to link two devices to one plan That way you wouldnt have to pay for a data plan for your phone and have a whole separate one for your watch I doubt theyll do that though,
Apple Watch series 2 is best in these 3 series,
Trying to make a video about a device with just one 1 new feature that you can only take advantage of when youre outside without your phone  three minutes of stalling for time,
I have Apple Watch series 2 and it is awesome,
So series 2 isnt around but the first one is must of flopped,
Im getting an Apple Watch,
couldnt they blend the LTE with the colour of the watch,
Some apples are red,
Ill pay 50 bucks not 400,
httpsyoutubeiet91sd4gKA,
Well nothing really changed,
All this health stuff on this watch the majority people are never even going to use Lets be honest Somewhat gimmicky,
How much price for cost ,
Things I lose when im drunk  My Wallet My Cellphone My Keys or My Glasses Never lost my watch  but never had to take my watch off because the battery lasted years and years though If I can Apple pay for drinks call my buddies withdraw cash from an ATM hail an uber get in and out of my house in an app all from my watch or by Parkour  That would be great Losing a wallet is expensive sure as hell dont want to lose a 999 smartphone could start using contact lenses 3 out of 4 isnt bad at all unless you run out of power,
So will this one sync to an android phone Or can it be independent and be used without an iPhone Can deacon G5 work with this,
can someone explain about the cellular feature i dont understand how will u get the lte without your phone Thank you,
Remember when Watches were only used to tell time,
So basically the same thing,
nice and useless product,
Can it run crisis,
whoever develops some black dot stickers to cover that red dot for the crown is going to make serious bank,
that red digital crown thing looks stupid lol its out of place whats even the use of that haha,
Whats the deal with the new ending screen Honestly what is the point So much empty space the only info you get from it is subscribe,
wow nice,
Meh I am waiting for a version that has small crystal sensor rather than large one because the large crystals make the skin not breathable which bars from me wearing it Metal back would be more breathable,
oh my lord the red dot looks SO DANG BAD ANY OTHER COLOR IS BETTER PUKE YELLOW IS BETTER,
que zela esse velcro,
The Gear S3 is LTE,
only product id consider buying this year from apple ,
Instead of Apple Watch it should be called iPhone remote,
No change in design over 3 generation,
can this be used with an Android phone or does it still need an iphone,
buy a 450 watch go to a gym  work out with dumbbells and if u accidently strike the watch with a gym equipment the glass cracks D lol they could have done much better if a few mm rubber was placed on the top to give it a more sporty look and avoid such mishaps,
I kind of liked how when u seen no service you instantly remembered let me go grab my iPhone lol but with this my iPhone will be lost somewhere  Ping is no good when your in two different cities,
cellular function only with Telekom in Germany and that sucks it should have more provider like o2 and more than i would love to buy it,
Ill stick to my 10 casio watch with 10 year battery I guess Its nice but looks kinda thick Whats up with the red dot,
Available*,
the samsung gear sport is better,
329 for a smart watch No thank you,
Not worth upgrading,
toddler toy watch lookin thing,
NEW AHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAH,
the only good apple watch was the 6th gen nano,
So if I jog without my iphone would it still play spotify on my headset,
Definitely need,
horrible  disposable  useless  expensive,
Stupidity it the same,
Does anyone know if you can answer your phone calls with a Bluetooth headset rather than having the whole world hear what your saying through the speaker,
I hope the speaker is better,
Is the series 3 going to work on tattooed wrists unlike the last 2 The last 2 series would not stay unlocked on a tattooed wrist,
Man you look sexy,
Is it with or without SIM Card,
Wow superb,
why is it red it looks cheap,
price,
I have the 1st generation apple watch and dont like it and have not used it for well over a year there is nothing that will make me want the series 3 I have a Fitbit Charge 2 that i use to track my daily activities but the Apple watch no thanks and this is coming from someone that is a total Apple guy,
woh needs lte on his watch everyone who has a smartwatch very few people has a smartphone battery life will even suck more because of lte,
How about listening to music,
How harmful is it or is it harmful to wear a constantly on cell device on your wrist For example other than when commuting I always put my phone a bit away within hands reach but not on me,
I dislike Apple as much as the next guy but cant deny their tablets are just leagues ahead,
Watching it on iPad Pro 105,
How is this cheaper than an Iphone,
Am I the only one that actually liked the new iPad it looked good man Also iOS 11 is pretty nice too,
Hey I see one of my videos being shown there ,
You gotta admit it this iPad is better than most tablets out there Im sort of tempted to buy one for college use,
I bought an iPad 3 for high school in 2012 for 499 Worth every penny I bought an iPad Pro for college in 2016 for 750 Worth every penny,
Dont dislike the video just because you are an apple hater this review is pretty complete and covers every aspect of the product being reviewed wether or not it is an apple product,
you dont sound like a nerd tho,
450 tfw wanting a file system means Im a nerd now feelsbadmanjpg,
I never used an apple device and probably never will but that dosent mean i bash everything Apple does Theyre doing their own thing and i respact that   They raise competition which is always good for the consumer D,
Apple never lies about Battery life  expect that one time when they even removed the indicator on the new MacBooks Pros lol,
8bit guy,
apple only went overkill with the camera so it would be future proof with AR,
Turning aniPad into my main computer Dafuk he talkin bout,
Wheres the review All I see is a 6 minute long ad,
Just switched from the basic iPad 97 to iPad Pro 105 This thing is a friggin revelation  Never going back,
I love the iPad Pro 129  I know not much has changed but as an artist Im hoping the new 120 screen is going to make things smoother ,
its an iPad,
whatcha doing with two mugs dieter,
Give us FCPX and Photoshop CC and Ill sell my MacBook Pro,
I think when they say full sized keyboard they are actually talking about the keyboards that attach to it not the on screen one,
if the are reviewing microsoft produxt there is so many criticism hmmmmn,
just came back from the Apple store and holy crap its so smooth when scrolling through pages,
So why didnt they put all this features on the regular iPad like they did on the past with the regular price instead of a Pro category It feel like cars at this point,
how much better Screen2 bigger and 4 better Cpu 3 faster Nothing else tnx now 550 more than the old Buy it,
this is a great college device since apple doesnt care about macbook air,
The basic thing everybody should know is Normal 97 iPadhigh school and below Pro iPads collage and grade 1112 if your current is getting old,
Oh its the 8Bit Guy I see youre also a man of culture,
LOL if youre such a nerd then I wonder what the guys at ArsTechnica or AnandTech are You might also be the only nerd that calls this tablet as overkill,
When iOS 11 comes Im gonna cry Was wondering if I should get this or a Wacom for my Surface Book with Performance Base I think Im going to go with this baby,
Thanks for this early review Anyway I would have appreciated a direct physical comparison to the 97 Pro,
Fantastic review Very wellroundedly and accurately described No fluff right on point,
I want a verge mug and a Ipad Pro,
The lack of a real file system has always put me off when it comes to iOS devices It is beyond frustrating Yet it does everything else so well that I keep going back to it I need to research iOS 11 Thanks for the post one of the best Ive seen in a while,
Im studying architecture and I would like to buy a new computer I usually use a lot of programs AutoCAD Maya 3D etc Suggestions,
They need to make a 4k iPad its taking to long for everything to switch to 4k,
Never adopt the first version of Apple products,
minor critique please use different music the bass sounds like someone in the next room skirting a chair over bare wooden floors always very well shot products here nice quality,
What app was that you used to edit the photo with Walt Mossberg,
There are demos where a Snapdragon 835 chip runs a full Windows 10,
Could buy a nice used mid2012 MacBook Pro for 650 too,
i have a iPad air 2 and Adonit pixel dont have a laptop i do my all stuffs on iPad movie editing working office Photo editing working vectors images etc No pc no cry,
Watching this on my iPad Pro 105,
Im an android user but in the tablet market their really only is the iPad Sent from my iPad mini,
Its a beautiful device especially for school use but Id rather spend 1000 on the new macbook,
Meh Sticking to my surface,
It just can not be your main device IF YOU ARE a pc gamer obviously mainly working with creative softwares such as Autocad Revit Photoshop Illustrator etc For those who arent using that stuff for standard users yes it can easily replace your laptop,
The 105 iPad freezes mine did right out of the box Did anyone else have the same issue I see many reporting on Apple forums,
Im use the ipad pro 105 to watch this,
Its supposed to be a review not a featurerecounting advertisement,
Damn This ads got me soo hyped up Im definitely gonna buy this thing The urge is real Im so excited P D D,
Will you be able to dragndrop files from iBooks to iCloud Drive,
I have the basic 2017 iPad with 128GB and I use that as my main computer no problems,
I Remember You From Somewhere I Remember You From The Verge Roundtable at CES 15 Havent Seen Since,
Horrible review he sounds hes trying to sell you a product,
its a tablet dont need no stinking keyboard,
Wait until you see iMacPad or drumroll the iPad Studio,
this review should be updated because of iOS 11,
CAN ONE YOUTUBER RECORD THIS IPAD IN 60 FPS  GEEZ is it that difficult ,
finally a better review from The Verge focuses on the positives but still points out the cons thank you ,
DIETER BOHNThe Verge what is your primary computer,
Thanks Great review and just made me even happier I ordered one,
If I didnt have a job that required specific desktop software I would use this in a heart beat,
This gotta be the most paid review,
apple never lies about battery life apple up to 14 hours of video playback,
How about running Mac os on this thing How About Mouse and trackpad,
Unfortunately the keyboard still falls behind the keyboard from the Surface tablets It feels too limited and theres no back lighting,
Apple never lies about battery life what,
Unfortunately still not an oled panel I guess Im sticking to my air 2,
Love my ipad But Filesystem lol Cmon This isnt a computer Its a toy,
Were talking RussiaTodaymeetsApple levels of bias here Congrats on your Trump speak Please tell me more about how Apple is so much farther ahead than everyone without bothering to elaborate on your claims Access to pretty toys and a hipster filming set dont make you a journalist,
Whats the program you are using at minimute 221 Thanks,
Did anyone notice that he was watching the 8bit guys video at 141 Macintosh Plus Restoration,
I cant wait until Apple comes out with OLED screens so all this its so good that its not fair business will come to an end,
now its faster than iphone 7 its a10x fastest tablet production ever,
Starting college in a couple of months and Im really split between this and the new surface pro,
when is apple gonna put usb type c in ipads n iphones lighting port is nice but to see an ipad that costs so much in 2017 without type c port isnt good,
I just saw one today at target and man it was awesome The specs and the screen wow it is AWESOME,
The question iscan i play roblox on this,
Dieter Bohn hipster in chief Apple fanboy,
What did you just say apple never lies about battery life  yeah right my iPhone 7 and my MacBook Pro with touch bar Both they dont last even close to what Apple claimed,
iOS 11 Will greatly improve the iPad in replacing a laptop,
Conflicting target audience I guess from Apple This machine should be a side device for students on the go Such as editing their MsWord before class editing their slideshow before presenting taking notes in class and even do some mini video edit for some cases It should be THAT secondary device but the pricing is way too expensive for student to buy,
120Hz screens are not new in the portable smart devices market Sharp AQUOS phones in Japan has been rocking 120Hz IGZO display since 2015 with their ultra thin bezels since 2013 Eg SH01H 120Hz in 2015  302SH  304SH one of the first few ultra thin bezels smartphones from Sharp  smartphone industry Cheers ,
If I cant get the fully fledged GarageBand then Ill always need a mac as my main computer,
IM WATCHING ON MY NEW 105 INCH IPAD PRO,
Multiple windows drag and drop a file system my god Its revolutionary,
Im impressed with this new iPad and iOS 11 but my Surface Pro 4 is more than capable of doing these things Good job for catching up tho Apple,
HUH Is dis guy for real Dats wat the last iPad pro can do as well HUH,
Best phones Android Best tablet Apple iPad Best PC Windows Wtf is wrong with all the fanboys,
The ipad i have is from 6 years agoalmost every app cannot run on it I should get this,
Because Im a nerd You are not a nerd if you need to say it,
i love how he was looking behind the camera when he criticized the keyboard as if the Apple overlords behind the camera are pointing a gun on him,
Looks good but Apple keyboard without backlight Unforgivable,
Apple never lies about their battery life *cough* *cough* heard of the MacBook Pro 2016 lucky to get 3 hours out of my 10 hour battery,
449 wow i didnt know that file file systems is for nerds nowdays,
baised af look at the surface pro first,
Main question that would make this my main device for school Can it run full functioning Microsoft Word and Excel Not app versions that dont offer full features,
only reason to buy this is to draw with it but that overpriced pen costs u anither 100 id have considered buying it if the pen was included,
Definitely the best reviewer of the Verges team,
thanks for a excellent knowledgeable review it was very informativeand helpful I will wait until the next update comes out and will subscribe to your channel for more info  again thanks,
Dafuq Its the same old ipad Its already 2017,
I think its pretty dope Walmart is already offering the iPad pro 105 at 50 off msrp,
speaking of the best thing why im thinking of the new surface pro,
Dude you just copied everythingapplepro on the jokes and comments,
Dude come up for air Ya got a mouth full of Apple gizz on your chin,
Great review initial Do you suggest a screen protector If so do they interfere with the Apple Pencil in any way some sort of lag,
seriously a review jam packed with apple praising  yuck,
dose the YouTube app on iPad support 1440p ,
ObiWan selling me an iPad Wow,
When will the 15 inch iPad come out,
Hi is there a file management As Default system in hard drive not as cloud,
Can the new A10X chip do HW 4K HEVC 10bit decode,
I bought one and OMG its so mobile I leave my macobook at home for all the non ipad stuff but cant complain at all,
Very nice review If the Verge was politics and SJW cult free as this video was Id still be a Verge reader,
A guy that describes himself as a nerd but is an apple fanboy  Hipster,
Its not a new filesystem The filesystem has always been there Theyre giving you *access* to the filesystem Using the Files app,
I dont like how you call this a review You basically just list all the specs and tell them what you can do with those specs Im missing all the real life stuff How fast does it launch certain apps How good sound the speakers How fast does it charge and how fast can you charge it How long does the battery really last ETC ETC Sorry man but this is necessary to be called a review,
I love apple products but he sounds a tad fanboyish,
Great job Dieter Excellent work on camera as always These higher end iPads are coming closer and closer to something I could recommend people for their primary computer Thank you for the review Truthfully at this point I could almost make the switch if I wanted to as my laptop essentially only serves the purpose of multimedia note taking web browsing and very light gaming If the steam mobile app allowed inhome streaming of games to a mobile device such as this I would no longer hesitate,
cant wait for my pre order,
So does hey Siri work unplugged as it does on the 97 but does not on the 129,
402  Cmon man Have some integrity,
everything you say sound like youre being sarcastic but youre not,
You are definitely the best thing,
Another new things added in this world which I cant afford,
I love that you are still wearing moto 360 2gen I have sport love it moto 360 all the way,
If only it had something like USB OTG support,
Ipad pro looks amazing but this guy definitely looks paid off,
n3rd,
Apple never lies about battery life umm not sure about that yes Im talking about the 2016 MacBook Pro,
Those complaining that it lasts 9 hours and not 10 as claimed you must know that he is using the Smart Keyboard which also also uses power,
Love this guyMake him do all the apple stuff reviews for me ,
I know the video that you showed 8 big guy,
Drag and drop Wow Such innovation,
Great review to the point Apple haters will surely dislike but please know that tech enthusiasts like me found this a very neat and concise video Thank you,
Musicsounds in background is super distracting,
Great review man Refreshing review style,
real file system well youll be disappointed,
Apple never lies about battery life,
Come on do a check for the amount of RAM,
omgaccess to file systemlets party like its 1999,
256GB for main computer are you kidding me I need 1TB,
This is a Fantastic Tutorial You were precise and explain it in terms most people would understand Thank YOU I have a Question I would be using this for Film stuff like my screenplay even some shots or editing my film from my camera Can this Puppy do that and can this also be connected to my MacBook Pro for editing etc PS Also Thank YOU for not have loud background music,
Motion blur  refresh rate,
Actually watching on an iPad Mini 2 XD,
When the original ipad came apple also claimed it had full size keyboard,
DOES 129 INCH PRO have the same 120 Hz refresh rate,
Exciting for files cause he is a nerd,
Good filming lighting editing presentation,
Main computer makes me want to buy a Surface just out of spite,
Thats a brilliant review,
who ever said ios doesnt need file manager 3 ,
The Verge its walnut on desk,
Simply the best tablet ,
to be honest I think this is way more better than surface pro After update to iOS 11 this machine will be a beast,
When you said like a football team up 20 some points in the 4th quarter I thought you were referring to the last Super bowl when the falcons were up 20 some points in the 4th quarter and still lost,
Dieter Bohn reviews are the best on verge Top Notch,
Is the iPad pro really good,
Oh lovely the camera which youll never use sticks out so it cant lay flat,
Dieter is starting to look like a grizzled old tech journalist,
i need a mac dockable ipad just like surfacebook,
is the screen oled because it looks lit in person,
This sounds like an ad No negatives,
Thx great vid hope you have great success,
What a fantastic review Bring this guy around more,
iPad is getting closer to Android good job apple,
iPad pro,
At start of the video The first thing which came to my mind was surface pro,
The Verge cant stop whining about Apple products Apple showing off overkill etc,
peep 8 bit guy on the screen,
I have had this for years I got a beta device but from another company They call their edition a surface ta daahhhh,
You nitpick the heck out of the Surface keyboards but this gets away with a little bit awkward on your lap plus you brush away the lacks compared to the Logitech boards with I like the iPad one Then you lowkey call everyone who would expect a proper filesystem a nerd I dont want to say you meant nerd in a negative fashion but rather few people label themselves as nerds Due to this you smartly advocate Apple not giving their customers appropriate control over what is theirs I dont scream *BIASED* under every The Verge video but this sly normalization strategy is just too much,
the verge always complement apple products i dnt get it its not a perfect product it doesnt even have an oled display,
I actually want an iPad now,
No DVDCD drive  Lol My mom asked,
Its nice how you said it if you know iOS 11 well enough you can turn it into your main computer I agree,
Dont buy any device with 120hz I bought a 120hz monitor 2 years ago for my gaming PC  and I cant help but notice whenever using a 60hz display basically everything with a display that it just doesnt feel as great its that good,
Idk I dont think that an iPad Pro can be a computer until it can utilize a mouse,
Its a nice thing but for that money Id rather buy a Macbook,
Will I be one of the beautiful people if I purchase one ,
You could multitask with a Samsung device for a long time,
Come on ya ever herd of the surface pro,
Excellent video review as alwaysBig fan of Dieter Bohn,
Whatever iOS it is still no ability to download or update 100MB apps using data connection,
As a student I love my iPad Pro Commented on my iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard,
Apple screen is XY resolution whatever who cares is APPLE  the verge reviewer,
England is a city,
Surface Pro enough said,
without macOS an ipad will never replace my macbook,
i mis a Amoled display love my Galaxy tab S2 s3 tablets,
What is the exact model of the Logitech backlit keyboard that you mentioned,
ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A MAIN COMPUTER ITS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE MOST PEOPLES LAPTOPS FOR BASIC MS OFFICE TASKS ETC PEOPLE CAN GET THE IPAD AND HAVE A DESKTOP AT HOME,
so the 105 ipad dont have dock from mackbooks,
Just wondering can you download ae and svp on it,
Lol Apple in ios11 Finally getting a proper file system in 2018 JUST getting a a file system Good one Apple,
how they get away with charging 700 for this thing without the accessories is a crime,
tablet is dead of course apple is better now,
Good for gaming with that 120 hz screen,
im stuck this or the new ipad pro 11 rEEEEEEEEEEE,
This man talks good,
This is how apple haters watch a review When The reviewer says surface is bettermost unbiased review ever When The reviewer says the ipad is bettervideo sponsored by apple,
The words iPad and overkill dont go together,
The best advice ever for iPad pro Wait for iOS 11 cant agree more,
Im glad they are showing off sow off some more please,
You sound like a fan boy,
loved your review,
Like everything about this iPad 105 but the keyboard Seems flimsy and nosteelfeel You know what I mean,
A proper reviewer wouldve bothered to install the ios 11 beta,
which music are playing in the background  452 time really liked it,
Personally I could never use it as a main computer,
No team has ever scored 27 points in football And there are only 2 halves,
The iPad Pro is a pro device without 3D touch,
httpsgoogl1ZrXHe New Apple iPad Pro 105 pouces 2017  Coque Protection arrire gel tpu transparente,
this is great man mine is arriving tomorrow,
I just got the iPad thanks for the review it really helps,
Its a good tablet but if theyre trying to sell it as a laptop Ill just buy the surface,
Hello Obi Wan Kenobi,
I cant watch pass 100 minute of this biased review,
Some android phones are 4k this iPad has 20 pixels more than 1080,
of COURSE it comes in space gray and not space black,
meh the Files app isnt technically a file system Its more content aggregation from many online sources We wont have true file system access until Apple allows us to use the devices space freely which makes it a pain in the ass to use in comparison to Android tablets in that regard,
My ipad pro previous version has completely replaced my laptop Its wonderful,
Okay so the Ipad is slowly evolving into a laptop So why not just buy a 12 Macbook which is already the end product of what the iPad is becoming Eventually the line between iPad and Macbook will blur so much that the two will just clash but the one with OSX ports  an actual keyboard will always be top dog It begs the question where is Apple going with this,
the Chromebook Pro is better more productive you got the pen in the box and as a main computer its just better and 100 less verg you know nothing,
I came here for a review all i got was a fanboy,
why would someone by this over a surface pro 5 ,
Until I can do iPhone data backups on an iPad it cant be my main computer as much as I want it to be,
Can you connect any portable hard drive on this one Does Lightroom work with raw files as well,
So get a Surface Got it,
the best looking tablet by far,
is it real 105 he holding,
thx 4 the review,
Too bad they didnt show off the leather sleeve with the Smart Keyboard,
could you be more of a fanboy,
iOS 11 is a game changer for iPads They become like Macbooks Its also really clever as MacBooks are awesome More integration between IOS and MacOS is always welcome I want more IOS apps on MacOS I want more IOS games on MacOS,
Hey you guys I have a question I recently purchased a iPad 97 2017 edition I am very tempted to sell this ipad and go pro Dont get me wrong I love this ipad 97 2017 but the pro version seems so awesome I wonder is this that much of and upgrade to go and sell this ipad ,
208 The truetone display is not necessarily a good thing It basically matches the color temperature of the display with the color temperature of the surrounding ambient lighting which is good for reading only as this relaxes the eye while reading For anything else its better to disable the function as it will alter the colors of any other content like videos games photos and so on if left on,
so almost 800 you can build a pretty good PC and buy a decent laptop,
Apple fans think having a stupid file manager qualifies them for being called a nerd Android guys are having a face palm moment,
the Verge are the biggest apple fanboys around even everything apple pro is awash more fair and balanced,
not to be used as a main device but the best thing ,
Its not a computer unless you can deal with multiple office files at the same time and have the freedom to download torrents and stuff ,
I usually dont like apple products but I think I kinda like the ipadpro,
What exactly are the things that the iPad Pro cant manage that a laptop can  Genuinely curious,
With iOS 11 I actually want to upgrade to the 105 Pro from my Mini 4,
Have you heard of Surface Pro,
Watching on a iPad 1st gen,
I got an ad of the Samsung tab s3 before this XD,
Nothing compared to Surface Pro,
Im really thinking about buying this for college in september instead of a macbook pro,
Just give us the Mac OS on a iPad device already,
That fish drawing,
but can you upload resume to websites,
Want to hear a joke LCD display,
Apple is showing off now but it cant do any pro things ok verge ok,
paid review obviously ,
its the 8 bit guy restoring that macintosh,
Hey  The ipad mini line up is still amazing  the keyboards are amazing and big,
the new i want to be surface pro but i cant,
These things can never be a main computer for a programmer It just wont happen,
Dieters reviews are the best Keep doing it ,
The upgrade camera probably for the AR,
I was distracted by him working on a cutting mat,
nah my ultimate gaming pc works better,
Lotta salty Microsoft slobs Only Microsoft product I like is Xbox,
145  inb4 Dieter Bohn Apple blew a 283 lead,
The verge likes an Apple productIm shocked,
self proclaimed nerd who goes crazy over a file manager lol,
Its sad they dont put any links to the Background music Way to be a tease guys,
showing off I guess our standards arent that high anymore when it comes to innovation lol,
Lets be honest we buy them for those aesthetic looks and pics,
by the price microsoft surface make it obsolete,
Pro Motion is may a promotion word ,
yeah must be an awesome nonamoled screen on a very expensive device useless review with no specifics given,
I have to say that iPad pro looks gorgeous but I can also do everything it claims to do on my 2013 Galaxy note 3,
All we need is mouse support for Remote desktop apps Pencil can replace mouse but lack of double click can be frustrating sometimes in some windows apps Which is does not make any sense because Microsoft also make pen and in windows environment it works as same as Apple does,
Great performance Great display Great battery life Great camera Great speakers Great software Great design Great cost lol,
anybody still rocking iPad mini 2,
Surface pro is better,
I just upgraded for a iPad Mini 4 64GB to the iPad Pro 105 256GB,
Bias channel This is apples second channel on youtube,
I prefer to have a surface pro as my primary device instead of an iPad without any ports,
I bought the 97 and legit 2 days later they came out with this,
this guy is the best reviewer on vergeNot biased at allLoved this review,
Error 404 Revolutionary Not found,
After watching the podcast for so long I know what Dieter looks like,
Only good thing about this video is the music,
When is Apple going to increase the screen resolution on the iPad The PPI is becoming more and more dated,
Irony  Getting an HP laptop advertisement before this video,
You guys should could be running the developer preview but I suppose reviewing software while its still in beta is not your modus operondi,
Hey Dieter love your watch and ring could you send me a link of where I can get it or better still send me yours which ever rocks your iPad,
Excellent review,
If you were a Nerd youd be using a surface PRO instead of a so called PRO device which doesnt even have a file manager yet needless to say it is the best tablet for media consumers nothing PRO or nerdy about it,
mouse for remote desktop it is essential,
With no iOS 11 on launch I may hold off And when I hold off I buy other things and end up not getting this It happens,
Probably my biggest question is how long will something like this last Like if I splurge on the pro will it last me a long time and not get outdated within a year or two,
best tech review channel period,
That apartment is off the charts JUST LOOK AT THAT COUCH,
This gentleman is the best reviewer at the Verge bar none,
Apple need to make an actual tv,
Im surprised The Verge doesnt upload their videos in 4K HDR,
Unlocking its full potential will destroy the universe,
just wanted to say youre doing an excellent job with these Apple reviews unbiased honest reviews for apple products are something the verge has been missing for a long time kudos,
That room is gorgeous I want it,
I am liking this guy more and more,
Would you only keep this guy for all apple related reviews,
Man this is an amazing video Fair on point and the cinematography is just stunning,
Just bought the Apple TV 4k as an upgrade to my 3rd gen Apple TV It is significantly better in every way to my old one But I will say this review is hands down the best review out there He is right how everyone else has reviewed it I subbed for this review alone,
When is an Apple TV going to be an actual TV,
I have no plans on buying a new TV anytime soon I bought a Apple TV 4K just to future proof my set up,
The women I would bring to that apartment Not to watch Apple TV 4K,
Whats up with 4k HDR Well you dont have this video in 4k HDR,
No Dolby atmos is deal breaker,
Nilay please do more videos for the Verge,
apple 4 K hard to set up with scroll type remote dose not suppott optimum altice one tv app will not sync to to my apple Ipad tablet had to return to Walmart pissed off,
Nvidia shield,
Fast and crisp video Only on verge,
045 looks like he was about to eat the remote,
So do you recommend it,
The Verge is challenging the youtube review community with unbiased opinions on seemingly pretentious devices Really impressed with the quality as well so keep it up,
I heard they are getting an update to dolby Atmos,
Best guy to review Apple Products,
I had the older Apple TV box It was cool and fast but it had its limitations like this guy says Eventually mine just ended up collecting dust and sold it,
Nice to see The Verge being a bit more objective on Apple reviews nowadays Used to be too fanboyish but now theyre my go to for reviews,
Seems pretty shady to open with a complaint about not supporting YouTube 4K and then saving the explanation for the credits,
Apple has a deal with Amazon so there will be a wide selection of 4k videos,
iOS cant play Webm videos in 2017,
At the end of the day cost set aside Apple beats everyone else in the market,
Im surprised that The Verge are doing seemingly unbiased Apple videos nowadays,
Very good honest and unbiased review Well researched and rich in information,
You will be charged by episode,
Can I protect apps installing uninstalling with password ,
you just saved me 200 bucks ill wait for the holiday maybe they might pushout an update,
You said in the video that there arent any devices on the market that support Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision HDR If im not mistaken the nvidia shield does support both,
Nvidia shield tv  180  xiaomi MI BOX 69 the best android tv 2017,
I really appreciate this video because you have such a relaxing mellow personality,
I own one mostly for Amazon Video and Netflix so as long as they work well Im not to bothered,
more videos from this guy please him and seifert are my 2 fave reviewers the skinny blonde dude they use for videos sometimes is not as good IMO,
what were they thinking,
No USB input is the deal breaker for me Xiaomi Mi Box  4K Ultra HDR TV is what I am currently using The best thing is that I purchased for 49 and gets the job done very well,
Struggle of existence is harmful in sap,
Basically Apple TV 4K lets you know with which companies Apple has a fight Would really like a deeper investigation on this Apple should invent How to makes friends with other companies,
Thanks for the review I was considering buying an Apple TV along with a new 4k TV,
They havent released the full power because they havent figured out how to charge you even more for it,
You might want to delete this video because this video was made before apple introduced Dolby Atmos to the Apple TV 4K,
You forgot Nvidia Shield that also have 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos,
So if I buy a movie that is in 1080 and it gets converted to 4k it will automatically be upgraded to 4k,
Your reviews are great Thanks for the info,
Thank You for being Honest,
Dolby Atmos is coming apparently,
The Verge your video production quality is amazing But whats up with the loud background music I cant turn up the volume since the background will drown out the voice of the reviewer ,
*Nilay is a review beast* He  the reviews has improved so much over the last years and Im lovin them So to the whole team of course  Becca  Garret ,
Very eye opening review great,
I think i will pass on the apple TV and get me an apartment like yours instead,
Apple never disappoint,
Hope *4K HDR* with Rec2100 Dobly Vision HDR10 also becomes the standard with *the Verge*,
Thank you for sharing your demonstration was clear and educational I have learned a lot of information that I did not know I must mention your MAN CAVE suits you very well God Bless,
I dont understand Because its Apple and they always hold stuff back for the next updated model that costs even more but still charge waaaay too much for their products,
Does Apple TV 4K work with the Xfinity Stream app,
excellent review thanks for your honesty,
I was literally getting ready to click purchase on this and thought Id better watch a review first just in case You just saved me 180 Thank you,
lol The Verge doesnt even have the 4K viewing option Go figure,
No bro  Nvidia Shield still the King of Streaming devices,
but now I can read 10bit 1080p linux distributions properly so win,
Chromecast  internet  underground movie  TV links winning,
You should do a rereview now that this supports Atmos as well,
Great honest review Really enjoyed this and the call out about VP9 and Google and Apple struggling to make deals with each other was the perfect ending,
Can we use it with a VPN,
The main reason that makes me consider the Apple TV is the TV App I really fell in love with it on my iPad Prime Video is so unnecessary tedious i love Netflix but theres just so much that dos not show up on the front page in and out Just last Week i watched Split on Prime ONLY because i was looking at it in the iTunes Store and later the TV App suggested to watch it for free on Prime Thats some pro consumer stuff going on If the TV App mixes together iTunes Sky Q Prime Video and Netflix as great as it dos on the iPad this is a classic Apple selling point of stuff just working more streamlined And thats stuff the average consumer uses gets used to and will pay for while the web nerds debate gigaflops and Ram amount Youll hate this when you read it because you are a web nerd but its just the reality normal people dont care that much normal people just want s**t to work,
Thank you man for this I kinda still want to buy it,
The Dark Knight problem is HBOs fault for not updating their app for 4K,
Loved every minute of your video In spite of some of the downfalls I still love my Apple TV 4K I couldnt help but notice your television set that you have in that apartment Could you please tell me how big it is and what the model is thank you,
Do they give you hdmi this time Or are we still stuck paying quadruple the price of a chromecast,
Verge is just doing a great job of exposing Apples new lineup,
So you obviously dont like the Apple TV what is the best and what would you recommend ,
Great review thanks Honestly I was about to buy one before this review This made my mind up,
No Dolby Atmos or 4K HDR on YouTube Bye Felicia,
the chrome cast is still the best for me,
Dolby Atmos comes with an upcoming update,
can you watch univision deportes ,
its not the most powerful company in the world,
They upgraded to Atmos on the latest update,
Chromecast FTW Costs almost 10 times less too,
Ive hacked mine it runs everything including emulators and loads of games and I can plug a usb hdd into it its ok now its fully unlocked,
412 what UHD does bothalways bashing optical media,
Love the living room lol  but great review Nilay,
Say what  No 4K in YouTube Smh compromising again,
I have a old Apple Box but I fr needa get this one its so nice Also can you steam from your from to the Apple box,
Who wants to watch YouTube in 4k when you can watch Netflix or Amazon Prime on it with UHD and Dolby Atmos,
You watch ESPN and CNN Hahahahahahahahaha,
Bachelor pad  Great review,
Hi awesome page Keep it up,
Love your reviews keep up the great work,
The tv and lounge though,
What a reviewer good job,
The question is  How is the quality of Music compared to Dolby Digital because it sounds pretty decent to me,
Great review thanks Confirming that Oppo and buying 4k UHD discs are still the way to go,
I think you guys should start doing 4K YouTube uploads as well The Verge maybe even on HDR,
I guess Ill invest in a roku for my 4K needs Or wait till Apple fix their,
Why still watching TV now a days Youtubes content is enough and sometimes overwhelming,
just say n0 people * you feel better,
Hello I just wanted to say that I really like how The Verge puts the videos together and also how you put your ideas together I can really feel the quality,
I ordered mine on release but then I canceled my order yesterday I didnt think it was worth it My built in streamer is good enough and supports 4K HDR,
Your Videos Nice L0L,
Lol stopped watching after 5 seconds,
You should update this video,
Seriously Apple hype must stop,
Best Apple TV 4k review,
apple 4k still has some time to go ,
Urm isnt VP9 open source royalty free,
The interior design,
Shield TV still the best there is Dolby Atmos HDR plus its Android and you can have everything you want in there I have one and I love it,
Do i need a 4k tv to get dolby atmos,
The Apple TV experience is like using a Ferrari to walk,
Well as of today this video is irrelevant atmos and 4K hdr apps coming with tvOS update,
I thaught Apple made real tvs,
The real problem is that there is actually nothing on the market that supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos sound together  hmmm not correct Chromecast Ultra is supporting this with VUDU now Google has it for 69 Apple not for 17900,
thank you man i was about to buy apple tv but with this review i wiil buy other product thank you,
Someones switched payrolls,
Are any of the 4k movies on iTunes full screen,
Cable companies will never get onboard with Apple tv bc then they cant price gouge customers with their useless clunky equipment fees,
Best reviewer on the Verge,
Will I be able to airplay my 4K vids from my 7 in 4K,
This is NOT better than Roku Ultra,
my wife would struggle with that touchpad Direction arrows and an OK button are much easier to use Is there an alternative remote with these keys,
Nilay are you in a Restoration Hardware store jeez that is a gorgeous couch couchnerd,
CNN breaking news LOL,
Could they have picked a more antiApple sounding reviewer,
Sounds typical Apple,
Great review Very helpful and straightforward,
I really dont know why you didnt get the BIG tv lol that thing is massive,
Nvidia shield is so much better,
CNN Lol no thanks,
This review was done really well keep it up,
as of now 4K viewers have liked this video,
It seems that these latest products from Apple arent even finished yet For the iPhone 8 Apple Watch Series 3 and now the Apple TV reviewers have contacted Apple about their problems with the devices and Apples response always seems to be yeah were working on it Were they seriously that rushed in development that they couldnt ship the product and software in its completed form Obviously there are going to be bugs and usability issues that come with a global release that Apple could never have foreseen however this latest cycle of new products seems to be vastly incomplete,
Actually this was a really balanced review Thanks,
in that avengers picture wolverine looks like zach galifianakis,
First your apartment is amazing second I agree with you on the remote touch pad Talking about getting you frustrated you will want to throw it against the wall after a minute,
Best review in a long time verry impressive,
Ill stick to my Xbox One S,
My 25 Roku express works well for me 1080p HD Netflix Hulu and sling TV work with zero lag Im almost ready for 4k but not yet Im still stuck in the HD era,
And I was thinking about getting this for Christmas thank you bro,
Love your tan,
Youll take whatever we give you and like it Apple,
Instead of buying a separate TV box just buy a console,
 I Just dont know why Apple wont let me take full advantage of the hardware  Because your in their playground where they make the rules,
I know apple,
What can i say used it but im back to chromecast works better,
Im confused Why would someone buy this in 2017 when every tv is a smart tv and has the same apps,
No Spectrum App TWC,
love that crib dude,
Thanks for this honest review You are correct on all counts Apple needs to do a little catch up with competitors I would like for Apple to be more compatible with other brands In a perfect world iTunes and Spotify would be seamless  not a fan of apple music  and Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV would sync I like and watch a lot of international TV and most series are only available via ACORN aka Am Prime Vid,
YouTube cannot be broadcasted in 4k is that right,
Couldnt care less about Atmos but the SDR to HDR mapping sounds like the worst idea ever They cant possibly do this on purpose No 4K HDR YT is a bummer as well but it really doesnt matter because GoogleYT sucks in general Not even the flagship Android TV box Shield TV which I currently own can do HDR YouTube and their recent update to the app just took away quality options All around a sorry state,
Guys Dolby Atmos is coming this fall so relax,
Who watching on Apple tv 4k ,
And now Apple TV is going to support Dolby Atmos So thats one problem fixed I still havent decided to get one though Maybe Ill wait until September to see what happens with Apple,
Im super happy with my 35 chromecast even though Im an iPhone user,
Does Apple have any product falling under Low Price category,
Overpriced and outdated Apple in a nutshell since Steve Jobs went,
still I didnt understand why would I need that,
this sofa called Cigar Leather and its expensive,
Give this guy a raise goddam,
Good review and critic but you are out of your mind to compare other cheap boxes like roku and others its like comparing a moped head with a Mercedes Its seems like you like and love but dont want to admitted 2cent,
Nice review Excellent clarity of language and amazing content,
Could I use Apple TV 4K on a 1080p tv ,
You know what though I just got one for 70 brand new so hey whatever,
The no support for 4k and HDR for youtube is not apples faultits Googles fault for them never ever updating it they have only updated it once I believe for bug fixes since the 2015 AppleTV came out No matter what the Apple TV 4K is going to get bashed downvoted no matter what because it is Apple,
Thanks for the review On my way to the store to pick one up,
Which is better then Apple tv Chromecast or Koku,
The chromecast ultra provides both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos through the vudu app,
doenst youtube have to update their app for 4k support,
The Verge is killing Apple Love it Real honest reviews,
The post credit,
Vudu offer 4K movies in both Dolby Vision and Atmos Yes most cost 2999 but if youre looking for the full package then thats the way to go,
At least you can use those products in the US In Algeria we still have dishes all over our buildings windows Absolutely third world,
I love your review style Excellent,
So if I dont have a 4K TV Plan to get one soon would it be fine to just get myself the 1080p version Can untrained eyes tell the difference,
Does it have Spotify,
Dude what TV is that Its amazing,
Well done Nilay for saying so clearly we want the Apple TV to have YouTube 4K HDR,
Can you do a updated review of this device,
Apple needs to actually make a real 4K OLED TV With its own software built into it Make a revolutionary new TV product that will change how we see movies and shows Probably going to be worth 1 million dollars,
lol why would you buy one of these things all tv boxes over a console,
The atv probaly doesnt support 4K hdr on yt cause the yt app hasnt been updated since like 2013,
This guy is always do a great job,
This guy always sounds like hes whining drives me insane I like balanced reviews but consistently complaining about everything diminishes your credibility,
New apple TV is amazing The fact all movies you buy in 1080p are 4k and all of them are the same price means Apple TV is officially the best device for 4k TVs,
Great review thanks for looking at the specs that matter I for one wont be buying until they at least sort the displaying of lower resolution content out Pretty sure I had a Roku a while back that did the same thing trying to display 1080p at 4K and making a hash of it Leave the scaling to the TV they are usually way better at it,
This needs to be updatedthey now support most of these things,
Fire tv is just as good and cheaper,
Could a regular consumer do a review than a hardcore tech junkie That way your biased opinions dont affect a normal persons buying decisions since not everyone knows or cares about atmos for instance,
Does the new 4K box still only support 1 wireless headphone,
044 lmao he vapping,
DAMN makes me think twice about purchasing this now,
The usual idiocy from Nilay The You Tube app is up to Google not Apple,
Honestly why he is the guy reviewing Apple products  Its never enough for him he always have fake arguments against them At the beginning he talks about price then he compares the Apple TV with an Xbox Come on man Choose a side between price and quality and make an argument Same goes for the Atmos Crying because we do not have Atmos with 4K HDR I dont see any Atmos speakers on your ceiling and more importantly where are the movies in Atmos I mean REALLY in Atmos  And beginning saying the Apple TV 4K doesnt support 4K on YouTube and giving the reason at the very end of the video Go on once and for all at the beginning and dont imply that its Apple fault Google is the only one trying is stuff Netflix supports 4K HDR on Apple TV Vimeo supports 4K only Google is giving the middle finger to everybody and trying to creat their own standards,
Dolby Atmos will be available through software update in the near future,
Nvidia Shield is all Im going say,
add few bucks more get a mac mini lol,
Im waiting for the Nvidia Shield with DV HDR,
I cant stand the way you talk I cant stand the way all of the verges members talk I hate all of them and I dont even know exactly why I hate this channel I absolutely hate it Yes,
Can you download kodi  Is the box rooted,
No HDR or 4K or 60FPS You Tube App what are they thinking,
DUDE for real with a pad like that the last thing i would be doing is watching tv  wink wink,
That works for all Smart TVs right I mean does it have to be from a specific variety of brands,
Is there any other way to get 4K movies with other options I havent seen 4K movies on Chromecast and stuff while iTunes has 4K Am I incorrect What other options do I have to watch movies in 4K via streaming,
Isint VP9 an open codec,
Wheres your review in the box All your video explained was that it didnt support the resolution that you want,
How many inches this TV,
Thanks you just sold me a new android box Never been into apple and now you just make it clear to stay away from Apple TV,
Ill stick to my 4k bluray player Nothing will beat a disc in quality Especially the sound,
Okay I heard everything I needed to hear in 1st 15 second 4K Youtube support,
So what is the best system,
Dont make me laugh,
You know what else is expensive Rent in SF,
VP9 is free and open source No deal required,
You didnt even talk about the main apps people may use this device with NETFLIX prime video Also Atmos now works on this,
httpappleinsidercomarticles170921applesaysdolbyatmossurroundsoundcomingtoappletv4kinlaterupdate FYI,
I Would upgrade for the updated remote and new processor alone 4k is 3rd to those two things for me lol and honestly the remote probably being number one just because of the little white ring,
No USB3 input for 4K playback from a external HardDrive  limits it to App play only   A DealBreaker For Me ,
Apple and Google should come to a standing deal on VP11 that way they would bypass VP10 hassells What i would like to see from Apple TV5 4K with improvements to audio oled visual adaptations Apple HomeKit and direct universal Siri I want Siri to be widely universal search engine with memory to know you from location and beyond but then again this is Apple they are 2 years too late with certain implements,
Sounds like a great device because all the things you mentioned that set it back I dont care about or dont use Thanks,
Upgrade of all your movies to 4k and 4k movies for the same price as regular HD movies is HUGE,
You dont understand why LOL They are saving it for a refresh few years from now This is how Apple works,
I got mine for free Still not sure about it though Ive been using Chromecast for so long,
Already have 4K hdr youtubeNetflix in my tv but want Apple TVbecause I just prefer apples tvOS but this half way boxno way,
Sits in the Apple features waiting chair,
Most biased review Ive seen Now give a review from a regular consumer not a tech geeks perspective Because its doing me great justice,
I love his appartment,
Would the Apple TV 4K work well with a non 4K tv,
The Beatles NOT Steve Jobs and his ilk created Apple With Epstein gone the band members became increasingly involved in business activities and in February 1968 they formed Apple Corps a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve artistic freedom within a business structure but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with Yoko Ono combined with the Beatles inability to agree on how the company should be run left Apple in need of professional management,
FYI Dolby Atmos is coming in a future tvOS update according to,
You owned my respect,
Loving the house,
Just have to say fantastic review,
I will watch with Apple TV on 80s TV i want see i got 4K Or no,
Did the Dolby Vision signal go through a receiver with no handshake problems Its still early days for DV interoperability,
Why would someone buy an external tv box when most of tvs are smart tvs anyway and comes with all those video streaming apps,
Nilay allllmost said something bad about Apple Theres still hope for you my friend and props for being a AV Nerd Honest and excellent review,
No youtube in 4k whaaaaaaat Fix fast,
They just announced support for Atmos full support for Charter Spectrum and other international tv services and promised the other major us tv providers coming soon They also announced fixing some other issues we were having with its usability,
this dude always give legit reviews,
your video isnt even 4k ,
This guy really hates Apple,
I wish the remote incorporated a keyboard I used to have a Sony streaming thing that had a remote like that but they stopped updating software so things got glitchy and I had to switch to Apple TV I dont understand why other companies havent done that or why Sony stopped making them,
lg good,
I really hope they fix that you tube glitch soon Was planning to buy this product and would have been annoyed because of course who doesnt love YouTube Still better than the amazon tv though I think Ill wait on this until it gets upgraded,
So why would I buy this over Chromecast,
Love him,
You should do more videos nilay,
can you get the xfinity app,
I got the Apple TV 4K Air plays audio keeps cutting and clipping Also the new remote lags and acts wonky You play that much for an Apple TV you expect it to work,
Straight up honest reviewer He needs to do more reviews,
There goes apple again making almost no significant improvements other then perfromace then of course charging way more for there basic features that other products have had for years,
As high tech as it may seem but unfortunately the digital optical audio does not work on itunes movies disappointing,
What is the stand that your PSVR is resting on,
I want a Samsung TV but Apple TV not really out of my budget,
Thats a very nice house you have good taste in style,
Please Apple take this upscaling stuff out that way my sony a1e can do all the upscaling,
Whats the model of the tv Its amazing,
This is why Apple needs to make their iTV product,
Apple TV is not a TV you buy it and you have to buy another TV smh well played apple well played,
This guy knows how to roast Apple,
Get the Hopper 3 it is the best,
Why cant iTunes just have iTunes work in 4K so I can use my computer,
Nilay Patel is killing it Great review ,
You didnt upload it to Youtube in 4K Verge,
No YouTube 4K HDR Support What  I dindt know that Apple owns YouTube ,
Hi there Can you please confirm if 24Hz output is available In the video only 25Hz is visible That would cause micro stutter of 24Hz content Thanks,
Wow what a review,
I see they still use that hideous remote control,
Wow this guy is top notch Micheal Fisher and MKBHD level Honest,
excuse me what type of tv are you using,
Its because YouTube is dying hahahaha,
This guy is a great tech reviewer I like how hes actually unbiased unlike that one blonde white dude with the glasses his attempt at objectivity always fails and were left with a subtle Apple lovefest,
Does the Bluetooth 5 over Bluetooth 4 result in better rangeconnectivity for Bluetooth HomeKit devices Any idea,
Is it fixed,
I thought VP9 is an opensource Codec So why does Apple need to make deals with Google Ik Google actually develops VP9 but for me opensource means opensource,
To be honest I didnt get why should I buy this box and connect it to my TV ,
Nice crib,
Idk y this kinda cringy,
seems like Apple has everything overpriced,
You have a nice looking pad Nice looking place to live,
I want it but I have last years model D,
Yeah Apple tv is isolated like North Korea,
Glad i canceled my order on this,
Nilay you are just too amazing  The review is spot on And vergethe cinematography is fab,
yet they still scored 75,
I got the Apple TV 4K Air plays audio keeps cutting and clipping Also the new remote lags and acts wonky You pay that much for an Apple TV you expect it to work smoothly,
I decided to make make a black notch cutout for my tv because its such a great design choice Now I can have the all screen experience on the tv,
70 chrome cast In Italy it cost only 40 and the Apple TV in Italy cost 150,
Forget reviewing apple tv go ahead and review that apartment,
Could care less about YouTube 4K,
apple tv remote should come with wireless charging,
The Nvidia shield is way much better,

Damn Look at the production quality,
People complain about the Note 8s price 930 but not about the iPhone 8s price 1200,
1000 Dollars for a phone My car cost me 2000 Dollars doesnt seem quite right,
The S8 is a completely different phone aimed at a completely different audience I wish these reviewers could understand this,
This piece of plastic I HOPE you werent serious with that one Its not JUST a piece of plastic S Pen software is exclusive to the Note series and if you EVER used a Note youd know that the software alone is enough for anyone to buy the Note8 Its a completely different experience than using a normal phone with a stylus its not just for touch and type,
Samsung makes almost 1000 phone Apple hold my beer,
Most people do not understand how innovative the SPen is and Samsung flagship phones are Remember Apples best stylus is called the Apple Pencil and it actually needs to be charged up to work but the SPen is powered by a special field above the screen so that you can hover select etc People also dont know that with Samsung phones you can use Samsung Pay using MST or Magnetic Secure Transmission technology to pay on almost ANY credit card scanner without support for NFC payments There are many more innovations that you get with Samsung phones that you just dont get with other phones,
I mean in comparison the V30 is looking mighty fiiine right now,
Does it have led notifications light,
Watching in my note 8a beast phone,
I myself had a note 7 and thought it was the absolute best phone ever I was willing to wait for the note 8 so I decided to get a note 5 temporarily little did I know that they would offer up to 480 for my note 5 for trade in for the note 8 As well as throw in a choice between Samsung 360 cam or wireless charger and 128 gb sd card Thank you Samsung Ive had my note 8 since yesterday and I already am in love with it,
156 I instinctively tried to press the X to close that add lol,
Iphone name to be mentioned Im not even starting the video yet,
One of the best review ever saw Honnest oppinion video effects that blow everything GG The Verge,
Can you post the awesome wallpaper just like with the S8,
153 The sheer *size* just kinda *_S U C C S_* You in You having fun watching that video,
Yay 294 views I need to get life Now,
Stereo speakers por favor,
If David Fincher made phone reviews,
In my opinion the LG v30 is better overall and the wide angle lens is more useful rather than the telephoto lens,
Is that a screen under the phone on some of the Broll If so I really liked the use of itfor highlighting info and such,
You can get a new s8 for like 600 on Amazon Not an extra 100,
good job verge thats some amazing quality stuff,
Awersome review but the wall paper was irritating,
Im surprised no one talked about Taylor Swifts Look What You Made Me Do Video Okay,
The best smartphone of 2017 This is a real mans phone while the V30 caters to children and the elderly GalaxyNote8FTW,
Damn i love big screen phones  so far note 8,
Actually a good The Verge review congrats nice job o,
i was not amazed by that phone reviewi was amazed by the production of this video and its quality amazing indeed,
Verge reviews have come such a distance Great job man,
Its all nice and good but theres one little problem The LG V30,
I really dig the monitor mounted on the table surface It adds more production value and sets your video apart from the sea of youtube tech reviewers Looking forward to seeing it used more,
42 seconds in and you already lost me at big battery No sir The battery isnt big Its typical and barely Especially for a 1440p 63in screen,
The editing of TV never disappoint but no way to buy this having the iPhone 8 coming next week,
Had no trouble remapping my Note 8 Bixby button with the bxActions app,
Amazing graphics on the screen under the phone Amazing idea,
you know its the Verge if after all the stunning production quality theyll forget the end and clip it in for fun Nice,
The most worst fone battery ever Drains so fast,
I would opt for the v30 but I use the stylus way to much and the no headphone jack actually makes me so flacid,
Big battery interesting,
Maan how many hours did spend to edit this video The quality and the music is sick asf Respect,
The video editing and effects are so cool Damn that guy is good,
Verge creating a whole new aesthetic view to smartphone reviews beating even MKBHD at his own game Team Aesthetics  Team Crispy,
When the note 7 came out it was ahead of its time It lived a short life but it was the best moments Ive had in my life,
The production that has gone into this review is amazing,
now that videography was absolute dope,
The wallpaper with abstract lines is also nice ,
Did verge uploaded anything Xiaomi mi A1 few hours back Because I think I got notification and when I try to look for it later I couldnt find it,
only maa nadella ne konagaltadu,
Verge please start using 4k camera,
1080p Its *the Verge* and its the fall of 2017 Get a *RED* and atleast support *60fps* and 4K,
Mine has shipped arrival date 9112017 Im with cricket and purchased and unlocked one which is why in asking if my S8 sim will seamlessly fit into my note 8,
I guess Im jumping ship from Samsung to LG V30 baby,
The cinematography is so awesomeway to go Verge,
Thank you Thats JUST the review I needed with the right perspective I like your bottom line,
*mrmobileandroid authoritygadgetmatchthe vergetechradar samsung galaxy note 8 review at the same time*,
I dont understand why dont yall give proper detailed information on the battery life For eg SOT and etc Battery is so important and yall tend to skip that part,
The verge never fails to give great quality videography,
the image quality of this video is like SUPER bad,
I lost my S8 sadly Im gonna buy the Note 8 then ,
Note 10  75 inch display,
This might have been the best review video you guys have ever made I love the graphics the effects the camera angels the sound the whole thing was just a piece of art Especially that screen under the device Thnak you guys Good Job,
The Note 8 is just an S8 Plus with a stylus the LG V30 is the best big phone of 2017,
Whats the point of an amazing display but a single speaker Just dont get it,
Very confusing review with no real conclusion Great visuals tho,
Video production quality way above review quality,
Again amazing review and those visuals wow,
The video editing is crazy bravo ,
I see no need to leave my s8 I can use the s8 for a good 2 more years and be happy,
Best BRoll Ive seen on a tech review,
Nice to see lefthanded guy like you,
Please do not follow the advice of any of these reviewers just go out and play with the phone yourself I went to my local bestbuy with in a few minutes I was sold Preordered my note 8,
You were using it already for MONTHS,
What happened with the video quality The Verge I see a lot of noise in the picture ,
Resolution is too small not enough cameras the screen is tiny its too light and it has a headphone jack Fix it and were good,
Get a Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact,
The whole time he talked about Te screen I was just having nightmares of me dropping it,
what an enjoyable review The props are good Good job ,
Great job on presenting it on the screen Loving the animations,
This video has lots of blurry moments and visual noise Also that screen the device was sitting on was a bad choice Cool idea bad execution,
This is the best Review Ever,
Sensible review as always,
Its pronounced Jif not Gif,
Great honest and unbiased review Just plain and nice explanation without the exaggerated hype Well done,
The music is too loud Other than that great review,
This is by far the best smartphone that i cant afford i cant wait to try it on the store ,
You also forgot the Note 8 allows you to merge apps so you can watch YouTube and use another app at the same time amongst other app pairings,
I have been a Note fan only because of its stylus even since I owned a Note 2 Which to date is working brilliantly,
Like an iPhone can do Why not like an Huawei can do as they were the very first,
background music omg too loud,
Dude you forgot to mention about battery life How long it lasts,
This review should be use to advertise Note 8The verge is way ahead in doing review DifferentlyGreat visual treat,
Soundtrack at the start please Please,
Does it have expandable storage with SD card,
what is the music from 130,
ALSO unlike most other phones the Note8 in mast cases is not madebuilt in China but instead it is built in Korea some also in Vietnam,
Love the setup The Verge That display underneath the phone was a killer idea,
i just bought this phone through Ebay for 740 auctioned with 256gb  2 wireless chargers  2 screen protector  1 case during black friday week,
Best part is its 500 bux in 2018,
too damn pricey,
but but but Dieter said I should buy the Essential Phone what do I do now,
so The note 8 its a GOOD phone But its not the iPhone,
The Verge team shoots the greatest Brolls ever,
I wish the corners were a bit more rounded like the s8 Edit Im not talking about the curved edges Im talking about the corners which in my opinion are a bit too sharp,
Hey No worry Pixelxl2 coming,
A very honest review I agree totally,
I compared the Note 8s screen to my S8 and its noticeably better Didnt think that was possible But the ones is nearly 1000 which really does have to do with the Note 7 recall I still think that the Note 7 only had a recall because people wanted to sabotage Samsung,
videography is,
Sick visual presentation,
The best smartphone in the world currently,
Best is LG V30,
Ill wait another yearor more for the note 8 price to come down It simply doesnt warrant the price versus what my s7 does,
The Verge editing style is the best,
So many reviews on the N8 getting uploading at this time,
in my opinion the most stunning smartphone review,
sexy editing whats the dubstep background music from 130,
Wow this guy actually managed to make a Note 8 Review boring,
At best buy you can get it for 830 or with a best buy membership card for 700,
THAT VIDEO PRODUCTION LEVEL WAS *LEVEL 999*,
luckily ios 11 has gif support,
this is what the iphone x should have been,
I would say that this is the best smartphone review Ive watched on Youtube,
A Porzingis phone,
is it for sale now or when will come out,
best thing about verge videos short to the point not crap like 40 min videos of reviewers,
Still s8 the best,
Thank you for the Hard G,
amazing work once again keep up,
another useless review that just lists the specs instead of actual use experience,
Stunning video effect,
If you had the Note 7 you get a discount on the Note 8 I believe its 425 dollars off Id call to make sure,
Look at this beautiful creature,
Note 8 all the way its the beast period,
Oh a stylus lets use a stylus  No lets not use a stylus,
Why does every YouTube phone reviewer have a valley girl lisp,
Meh Gonna wait for the Mate 10,
WARNING THE DISPLAY CRACKS REALLY EASY ITS NOT A QUALITY PHONE AND YOU SHOULD NOT BUY IT,
I dont understand the point of having the best speakers when really majority of time ur using Ear buds,
why am i look at reviews iam more than likly gona buy it already lol,
As a current Note 7 user I will buy it only because I need to fly and they are offering me a 450 discount here in the US Otherwise no sale,
Im watching this in 1080p and theres a ton of noise in this video What happened The Verge,
Wow 930 In Macedonia I got it for 1200 which is nearly 1200 or 1100,
Wat a Dark ass video review very some lights for your set genius,
oppo f5 is better dont need the stylers,
dont forget the Stylus is just better with any asian language,
I came here for Note 8 Review I am leaving in delight about how well this video is produced Wow,
Such a brilliant review,
I think note series should have a feature like face time what yall think,
Spent more budget in effects then cameraused to film this,
LWYMMD,
Superb review Fantastic production quality,
Whoever produced this deserves a big cookie,
I tried this phone at the store its a beast,
I miss my old Note 2,
which variant is good enough for any premium Samsung phone snapdragon or exynos rplyzz,
Can somebody please buy me this phone im broke,
omg where did you find that awesome music beat I think it would be to make a dance with it and do a flash mob,
Excellent reviewsthx for the update,
Thanks Verge Amazing videography And I like the fact that I just dont watch something I cant buy xD I actually take home something that I can use Make new wallpapers for every review videos and you keep your viewers happy William Joel is amazing,
I love the effects on this review looks awesome,
Usually Im not so early,
Sadly I am stuck with the pixel another year I would be stuck with the you know what didnt you know happen I guess I will look forward to the note 9,
You forgot to mention the awesome paired app function,
Getting the Note 8 for sure,
Wallpaper please,
Thanks What about the battery life ,
I just watch the verge reviews for the cinematography,
Over 900 usd for a phone is too much,
oneplus 5t or this,
Big Battery are sure its lower then S8,
Forget any other phone this the boy,
Please review the P20 pro,
Can you give the link of the wallpaper,
Slightly annoying being left handed and using a Note but boy I still love the pen,
Lg v30  note8 facts,
I see hundreds of reviews on the same phones daily but your delivery keeps it fresh the right amount of info with the right amount of time before my mind starts to wonder keep up the good work,
I was so hyped for this phone but nowmeh The price kinda dulled my enthusiasm and then I saw the V30 Sorry Note 8 Ima step out on you,
It does *not* have a big battery its smaller than the S8 plus,
Note 8 looks like Sony Xperia XA ultra,
The V30 is a better overall android phone to me,
I like what the verge have done for this review concept Expecting another good one for Note9 as well  This guy reviews better than another guy from this channel,
This editing is so clean y,
The review had nothing that we already knew about Best luck on the next one,
Drink a shot every time he mentions the iPhone 7 plus,
110 *are you senile* Note 7 was almost the same as S7 Edge Much closer to it than N8 is to S8,
samsung is best for phablets hands up,
I would be so happy if the maple gold goes on sale in United States ,
Guys why do you film at such a high ISO that everything looks so flickery Stahp it,
why else would we stick with the phone if not the stylus,
Seems like this is the first year LG won the phablet battle with the v30,
Is there any chance you guys mixed up the names in the picture comparison The low light shot on the left looks much better,
Stop fighting brothersIve myself switch from Android to IosIt just the way u like itUr Own Choice both ios and Android are good to useThis Note 8 is Damn Beautiful 3,
actually the mega was 63 in when it came out therefor it was samsung first biggest phone,
Thanks very much I will buy the note 8,
Great phone just dont drop it Ill have a look at the LG V30 before I consider the Note 8,
buggin the portrait mode on iphone 7 is okay but i use it seldom because its wonky and can see the artificial software flaws the Note8 does this feature wayyyyy better that price tho *smh*,
I would have really considered if they had put some great audio features like the Quad DAC or AptX HD support you get on the G6 Or dual speakers which would give a great stereo effect I guess V30 is my choice of phone now that they are offering an OLED display as well Catch up Sammy,
My dream phone But impossible,
Whole world iw just dreaming for note 8 ,
I dont believe samsungs system I used S7 edge and its even slower than my iPhone 6 in iOS 10 So I changed to iPhone 7 Plus Now I want iPhone Edition,
Just here with my blackberry keyone black edition and I think everyone should know that kk  Bye,
haha so gonna buy this cause you showed Taylor Swift haha lol,
Awesome review Thanks,
only problem is dead pixel,
This phone probably will end up whit broken screen this curved side glass breaks easy,
I thought the storage was 64128256 GB at first glance,
im going to happy next year when everyone stops talking about displays and how pretty a phone looks Every phone looks the same now so we can start making more innovations under the hood,
Seriously the phone has so much more to offer ,
I just tried out a Note 8 It demolishes the S8 The Note 8 feels much more secure in hand The camera launches faster when double clicking the power button It feels much less likely youll smudge the camera lens when using the fingerprint sensor It feels like the proper step up in size from an S8,
A big battery biased review,
Blur the background like an iphone can do actually note 8 can blur the background live  iphone cant do that,
0432 Oh hell no Gif is pronounced like Jiff,
Its pronounced gif not gif,
Not sure if its a review or an ad,
goodbye Samsung Note 8 950 dollars is toooo much for my blood Im getting myself an LG V30 ,
346 DAYUM  Man the verges phone reviews are just out of this world,
I came here only for the cinematography I know that it is a good phone its the way they execute it that runs chills through my spine ,
Did you say big battery,
Hey guys we gotta BLACK note 8 lets film it against a BLACK background in the dark studio because we are bunch of artsy hipsters Brilliant Dan always does great reviews though,
Please dont buy these kind of expensive phones If we buy they will make it more expensive,
Its pronounced jif not gif ,
the video team has their monitors miscalibrated or too bright or something the whites need to be brought up a little exposures good though i cant make out highlights on low brightness and i just calibrated with an i1 yesterday,
Got my note 8 a week ago for 750 best phone out in the market no doubt,
This guy looks like the dad from wizards of waverly place,
Only 7 Days Left,
I like your videos because of the beauty of the video,
I need this wallpaper,
Holy crap Look at the cinematography,
LG stylo has a stylus,
Careful in buying Samsung phones and tablets seems that at some point in time they want you to replace them when suddenly your drivers do not work,
Watching this from my note 8,
when i owned the galaxy mega 63 all the friendspeople thought i am a crazy boy a stupid an odd person with an odd phone etc not i see the same people attracted by the note 8 and i think they are  VERY incoherent  i was ahead all other minds loving a 63 inches when the normality was 48 5 55 inches,
I am surprised at how much noise there is in the dark shots the setup is amazing and pretty sure you guys have a solid camera but watching this feels like it was shot on a canon 100d  nonetheless  great review as always ,
Sooo original a dual camera setup which blurs backgrounds and is also a telephoto lense wowwSHITSUNG fans UNITE ,
do all s pen features work with a skin on the UI,
Even though some liked features are missing like easily removable battery and IR blaster the Note8 is still the best ever made,
Another big ugly samsunk copycat of iPhones dual camera system And the useless piece of plastic aka stylus is never worth that much extra money ever,
When are they bringing out a new version of my Galaxy Mega I cant let this bad boy go I just cant,
I saw Taylor Swift and immediately liked this video,
Samsung was too safe with this Note Only year Ive contemplated with the note,
It looks like Sony Xperia XA ultra,
Gift  Seriously Instant dislike  Its Jif phaggot,
Did i miss the part about app pairing Multitasking,
The S8s doesnt have a digitizer on its display so it cant register the Spen when used on it So calling Note8 an S8 with a stylus is technically incorrect,
Just order mine sprint waved all fees 50  off  40 extra a month cut down to 25 would have been cheaper if i paid more today Got a tablets tototal cost today 2200 i rounded up  lol cant wait gb note 5 hello the great 8,
Whats that game the one on like a ship thanks,
My arms are tired from watching theverge carry so much water for samsung What a toothless review To date Samsung has NOT published any explanation of the root cause of the fire failures,
Skipping note 8 Either v30 or iPhone 8 for me,
I miss the note 7 ,
music 130 verge reply me tell me what its called,
stylusreason I like the Palm,
Lol samsung copy iphone duel cam,
039 a big battery lol,
That screen on which the phone was placed had awesome effects,
MI Mixx 2will be Supreme over the Note Again,
Kinda with this video was 4k Sexy shots but theyre super blurry,
Drop that wall paper,
With the iphone X out it is more eXpensive and doesnt have a finger print sensor sooooo yeah note8,
Watching this on a galaxy note 3,
The s8 is a better phone,
Wher is 360 gangs,
Videos like this is what makes The Verge so good The site has had shitty articles lately but you guys put a lot of effort into the videos though As for the Note 8 its meh but mostly because of how good the S8 already was And I expect great battery life from a Note,
for photographers please jump to 439,
What a gorgeous back on the Galaxy Note 8 Im going to get that for Christmas next Christmas I hate myself waiting Ive been trying all these giveaways and then I never win,
Gosh Loveit,
Love my Note 8 Glad to have my S pen back,
That thumbnail is beautiful,
Ill run for LG V30  That hasbetter camera options and well placed finger print facility,
15 million subscribers come on the verge,
big battery is this a paid review,
As a conclusion this reviewer likes Apple,
I would love that screen you put the phone on,
930 its a lot of money for a phone I only got it because of the 360 camera and the 400 trade in of an old iPhone,
Great review man,
Low light portrait was so much better on note 8 iphone had noisy and grainy af image,
Cab anybody review this phone without mentioning the s8plus Im pretty sure ppl already know about the s8plus,
Fun fact You can basically get used to anything is actually the new North Korean national anthem,
The pictures of the note 8 looks much better than the iPhone though,
Im sorry but I cant help it I just watch The Incredibles last night and he looks like Mr Incredible Im in awe,
can we capture blur background video ,
I thought theres something wrong with the screen brightness of my phone but its actually some parts of this video is dark,
230 *WHERE IS THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4*,
very cool phone Note series the best,
Cant wait for the new iPhone it is gonna be LIT screw this phone,
Im using a moto g5 Can u tell me how can i get that recenthomeback icons in that shape,
this phone looks awesome I always look for a phone based on design first and specs second Only thing is the price is too high,
Whats the song in the background in the beginning,
Lol Taylor my queen,
That table is lit,
Getting this phone for my birthday and my birthday is 9 days away,
the only thing i can complain about is that it still hasnt shipped and watching all these video on the phone makes the wait worse and this dang hurricane is probably going to delay it more RIP Florida,
This review was so bad that it made me unsub,
l am still using note 2 still works great i dont need many usless function that no one needs i just need the phone for calling and messaging THATS WHAT PHONES ARE FOR RIGHT,
1000 USD but does not have an FM radio receiver Thank you Samsung,
Who is still watching in novemeber 2017 ,
Theres Always A Second ChanceOr At Least A Chance To RecoverAnd The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Is A Splendid Recovery Indeed,
Note 8 or V30 Take it easy dudes I wont buy it I mean I cant ,
Perfect Review,
*IPHONE OF HOUSING* On the top right corner *Presented by Samsung*,
Now your home can be hacked,
You cant just solve the housing crisis by making a cheaper house Umm excuse me but the reason why there is a crisis is because housing is so expensive,
Were not competing with highrises Wants to make it into multistory apartments Dude,
And one bad update and your whole house becomes bricked,
I just cant take a guy wearing that hat and glasses seriously,
Iphone of housing So overpriced and bad,
 your home should feel like yours so we are creating a machine that spits out the exact same house every 57 seconds talk about idividuality,
The iPhone of houses So that means my electricity will slow down when newer versions come out,
If I spill water in my house do I leave it in rice for 3 days or is that just a hoax,
Houses will be made like Iphones He means overpriced underfunctioning and obsolete in a year then you will have to buy a new house 139k for a basically a hotel room These people really dont understand what affordable means,
As a concept I like it But the execution is poor an example of a company so focused on cool that basic structural engineering problems are ignored For instance the flat roof flat roofs are great if they arent actually flat you need some gradient on the roof so that water doesnt stagnate Now look at 305 the roof has stagnating water on it because the roof wasnt designed with a gradient or at least not one sufficient for drainage The person living in the house will eventually end up with a leaking roof Architects and engineers are helpful for thinking of and solving these issues the Kasita team doesnt seem to have many of them Again I like the concept of small efficient living spaces but Im not putting my money into something like this until their team realizes the product has to be a good product not just a cool one,
If this was affordable it would be innovative this is cool but how can poor people who have the real housing problem benefit from this,
So what happens when someone hacks into my house _,
Price Availability Average floorspace realistically useful amount of storage space This video told us nothing Its basically just an ad,
Me *anxiety taking over* House *Playing despacito*,
black out and your screwed,
Sounds like the most hackable house ever,

Houses to be made like iPhones Wut And invokes Alexa Video presented by Samsung,
This dude is insane 139k for what looks like 300 sqft this deff is not a tiny house nor affordable ,
just take my money well i guess 5 arent enough,
Like cars and phones you mean breaks every few years by design and has to be replaced,
Alexa play despacito No ALEXA PLAY DESPACITO Ok self destruct in T minus 5 4 Fuuuuu,
To be fair most of these smart things seem really unnecessary Especially when you consider that theyre going for that younger not as wealthy core demographic here I mean 139000 for such a small house is waay too much If they could remove some of the smart features and sell it for a more reasonable price for example to a student then I think itd sell a lot better,
Mine would have a huge sign out front that said depression,
I dont trust it for all u know there might be cameras everywhere,
Closer to a black mirror future every day,
The iPhone of houses Presented by Samsung,
Alexa turn on bad ass movie night mode Im sorry your house has been hacked by ISIS and will explode in 30 seconds,
Building one furniture included costs around 15000 max likely less those gadgets around 2000 Thats 17000 total yet they want to sell them for 139000 And it doesnt even include land Thats almost 10 times as much as it could cost to make them What a scam and theyre so ugly as well They dont want to make the world a better place they really just want to make money lmao,
For me the real meaning of house is out from all technology Which mean I can really enjoy nature without someone call me or not by watching tv or something,
As a spanish speaker I believe Kasita sounds ridiculous v,
Not competing against highrises talks about distant future being stacking these condos up,

140K is not cheap Dude,
Id live here but I dont like the idea of having a smart home Feels weird,
*NOW IMAGINE JAPAN FILLED WITH THESE HOMES FOR SINGLE PEOPLE COUPLES 3 PEOPLE 4 PEOPLE LARGE* now thats something to imagine *DAMN*,
Whats the point of making a house this small if its not affordable Theres family size houses for the same price as one of these,
*How much it cost*,
I could buy all the materials the house used for 139k and make 100 houses with that I thought it was affordable,
Alexa You cant enter the house Me why Alexa  house needs a software update,
Wow now thats a perfect way for the governmentCIA to spy on you without lifting a finger,
I think its neat to have a  smart house but Id be afraid someone would hack into it youd have no privacy,

So Expensive technology unaffordable that will change how the rich live Good,
The idea of the stacked houses reminds me of the stacks in ready player one,
If it costs too much id rather buy a proper home,
presented by samsung me nahhhhhhhh nvmmm,
139000 which all has to be paid before you can move in and does not include land or installation This is what he considers affordable housing And he wants to sell one every 57 seconds,

The iPhone of the House Wait IPhones are expensive soooo PSand shouldnt it be called the Galaxy Note of the house,
lol Covers up the Reg plate on front of Audi then shows the back one then the front again ,
Im curious if it runs out of memory storage what is it 1tb housebut u have to pay an extra 40000 just to buy more storage,
Knock knock ITS HURRICANE,
Is 139000 a good deal for this,
Houses of the futuremore like houses of the rich,
When he said Netflix and chill but YouTube screen showed up,
I actually like this idea My problem is the pricing,
Alexa let me hack this house,
Best intro of all time,
I like how they say that this could be a solution for cheaper houses but everything in there especially the technology looked 10x more expensive than my apartment,
we have the ability remotely turn the devices on and off yeah sorry im not living in a personal home controlled by some one else,
Best house for an introvert like me lol,
This is nice but I wouldnt want my house controlled by a device Things are too easily hacked,
50 of the comments Android fanboys Other 50 Mimicking every thing the people in the video say,
I bet its more expensive than my house,
I like the technology and kind words Nevertheless it doesnt integrate sustainable materials net zero energyefficient or environmental factors I like how New Age Home Construction can integrate those things,
Why am I getting black mirror vibes,
Dame tu kasita,
Bad idea because 1st Expense 2st Hackersviruses and stuff like that3st And eisily to break in also,
What if people get jealous and throw stones at kasita,
IPHONE of hoses soooo you are selling houses witch are for their price very bad I think you should not compare your phone with any phone as people will be biost very quickly,
The iPhones of houses so its a nice design with virtually no use customization and is way more expensive than it needs to be,
He uses the newest macbook video presented by Samsung,
Hold on I need to pay my student loans off first Then let me think of getting an apartment,
Its so good it should be the Android of housing,
THIS IS SO COOOOOOL,
I admire your innovative idea but Arent purpose of house is to make you feel better or change your mood to home feeling instead of continuing the same rough office mood I believe there should be some things that are away from technology Peace,
Stacks like in Ready Player One,
iPhone of housing Pls no I dont want to buy a new one every 5 years,
price point 138 thousand yep the production costs of this dont even come close to 20 thousand,
Too small Make it a touch bigger and I would be interested,
An expensive extremely small house made for eccentric rich people Ill pass,
Lol solves housing for upperclass individuals,
Its a good idea in theory but having everything connected by electronics is problematic when the power goes out how do you access anything else that normally doesnt run on electricity,
Houses like iPhones Video presented by Samsung,

After 10 years you will enter the hospital because you live within oscillations and frequencies Most doctors say the same thing,
This is so sad alexa play despayeeto,
alEXA PLaY DesPpACITo,
That guy is trying so hard man It actually made the video harder for me to watch Im trying my best not to make an evil comment but it really made me pause the video and ask myself wait what a few times But if he is aiming this to anyone old enough to buy a house I dont think this is the right way If this is an ad its bad But if its a real The Verge video its even worse,
Now THIS is what I call a modern house,
What if the power goes out,
inb4 you buy one of these crazy over priced sheds and get to a point in life where the amount of actual living room just isnt enough for more than one person,
Imo these houses are more expensive than the traditional once,
I like how they used iPads and compared the home to an iPhone when the video is presented by Samsung,
If you can make it affordable its a good concept but if this is gonna cost someone more than 150000 i dont see how its affordable and what if all these things just mess up more cost,
Internet of things imagine theres this in watch dogs,
i love tiny contemporary houses but turning your entire house into an IOT device is stupid and leaves you incredibly vulnerable,
Higher tech flats then Wow how clever,
Video is great But why iPhone of homes Whats the connection here,
Ihouse,
I like how its the iphone of housing but is presented by samsung,
Can you make for me one pice,
Im going to hack your house can be a legitimate threat now,
If we need to remotely power devices on and off we have the ability to do it So someone could hack your entire home,
I want one with a hooked up Xbox One X,
Would I buy it if I had the money NO This is good for a couple If they make kids Everything turns to dust,
This reminds me of the stacks from ready player one just nicer,
I saw one of these at bats stadium thought it was pretty cool beans,
4 minutes long and didnt mention anything about storage space kitchen space bathroom toilet bedbasically everything important for living in an apartment But hey at least the guy has a stupid hat,
Dame tu kasita Ah ah Dame tu kasita,
I reaaallly hope this becomes a huge thing in the near future,
Netflix bouta turn this into a Black Mirror episode,
thats the house i always make in minecraft,
Now I just need bank account that adjusts to the way I spend and Im set,
Love this I want,
This is so sad AlExA pLaY DEspAcITo,
If you want a house like this just watch Mr Robot first Youre welcome,
Welp time to play Minecraft,
Whats the point of that Just get an Amazon Echo and a Philips Hue,
presented by samsung and you mentioning the iphone for housing,
you forget wifi bill goly dang the house wont work,
Like little prisons to trap people when the power grid goes out,
If this house is smart than it shouldnt be called the iPhone of houses,
Does this feel like a facebook video to anyone else,
i would not mind a house this small but i would swap the TV for my computer xD i dont watch TV at all its 90 ads anyways  the 10  that actually airs is either something i dont care about or something that has been rerun so many times the tape would be grey by now,
i want one Could i have one on the back of a tesla semi lol,
man were living in the future,
I thought this is about economically efficient housing for those who dont want to pay more than 20k Its entirely an ad for that Alexis whatever her name is,
But will it stand Hurricane Irma tho Lol,
Im okay I would rather live on 20 acres with horses and s log cabin,
Ready player one is happening,
Stacking them would be very dangerous,
Alexa please go to combat mode *turns to a robot*,
Your new hackable home You can be locked out and everything can be controlled by a 12year old in Czechoslovakia  truly modern convenience Yeah I think Ill roll my own thanks,
Im interested in investing in this business module India would be really thankful for this,
Youre paying 355 per sq foot for a poorly engineered home and the same sq footage as a hotel room,
I reckon it would be cooler if they got rid of alot of the smart features and made the house cheaper Then ship it to Australia For me Only,
So its like nakagin capsule tower in japan but with bigger house and more robust tech,
Kasita comes from Casita in Spanish and it means little house,
more crap we dont need,
Future   ,
Cool but what if the power goes out,
251 Did you see Ready Player One The future is now,
But is it cheaper than regular housing Dont want an iPhone of houses in price,
like the house not so much iot,
Alexa turn on sexy time,
And it has a headphone jack,
305 poor lady She thinks hes taking photos But hes just messing with the settings,
Wow I hope in their review they dont put him in a suit and make it look like a tron movie,
I love this reviewer hes a lot more blunt than others from the Verge and he also goes more in depth,
Most of the tech today is merely a refinement rather than innovation Meh,
I love the intro BOOM,
of course the verge needs to dedicate half the video on the battery,
I still use note 4 and I like it because the battery is removable,
last i came this early  the S pen was stuck when inserted backwards,
love note 8,
I have been using note3 for four years Its time to change the phone,
This guy does great reviews,
Gorgeous Yep Expensive Yep  869 in the UK black or gold options Do I want one Hell yeah Will I get one Nope  my OnePlus 3T will do just fine thanks ,
Beautiful phone The cameras might push it over the Pixel for me Plus Im a sucker for screenoff notes so convenient,
Ive been holding onto my Note 4 and waiting for the newest version that doesnt explode I think its time now to take the plunge,
Watching this on my Galaxy S8 plus Still good,
So sad that people are willing to pay 1000 for the iPhone 8 with less features than the Galaxys Btw yall paying 50 of the cost just for the branding of the iPhone 8,
this guy needs to quit smoking A SAP,
Thats ittake my money,
The last one BLEW UP in sales,
Basically S8 plus with a stylus and dual camera,
A bigger screen should come with a larger battery Why is the battery smaller than their Galaxy S8,
Audio and video is not synched,
Cant wait for the Note 8 plus,
Fast processors waterproofing great cameras lighter touchwiz great displays Samsung is awesome,
Stop hating on Samsung dude,
Fun Fact  Note 7 jokes are now a year old Dont,
Still gimme that V30,
Cant wait to get it I am so happy that I didnt buy S8 plus,
I love that every phone Samsung makes the curve less pronnounced Next year itll be straight like always lol,
Why does nobody talk about battery life on flagships these days For all the advancements smartphones have made people seem to be settling for one working day of usage And these companies keep ignoring this aspect because too tech reviewers only want fast charging and wireless charging and all that bullshit It seems flagships these days mean that a mediocre battery life is a given and people just accept it Shame,
Send it to Afghanistan  New Model IEDs,
Allo if youre crazy lmao shade,

Too expensive I can buy a good laptop with dat money or even good computer If Im looking for a phone Im going to look for a phone that has basic stuff,
LG V30 Note 8 Iphone 8 tho yet to announce Wish i had the money to get all of them Good job everyone 3,

Because Im a nerd If you need to say it you are definitely not,
You certainly can remap the Bixby button Ive done it with a simple app off the play store,
Did you just say Standard Animated Ghif omg ,
The design looks cheap,
First thing Im gonna do Lower the LCD density significantly Imagine how much more will fit on this massive screen,
The Galaxy Note 8 screen is brighter than my future,
Respect Iphones but NOTE IS GIANT,
first 10 seconds and with that first line im already not watching the rest try again next time,
Apple needs to start taking notes Oh wait they dont come with a stylus,
watching this on galaxy young android 20,
Oh God why why am I so poor Shut up Kenny,
This version blow 8 times stronger,
IT STILL HAS THE FRIGGIN HEADPHONE JACK,
Switching to the iPhone 8 I would prefer to pay 40 more and get 50 less bezels,
ITS PRONOUNCED JIF,
*Allo* if youre crazy,
Siri button is hardware bloat but everything else seems dope,
Note 8 comes with an exploding battery too  Thank you to our loyal customers for sticking by us for the past year which has been a difficult one ,

So Im hearing they made the screen bigger and added a second camera and people say Apple is running out of ideas,
Verge I am a straight forward guy Pin me,
007 lets appreciate that smooth transition for a minute,
The problem with your review right off the bat is you had to mention the Note 7 exploding Im tired of hearing about it Just move on with the Note 8 review Please,
He said Allo if youre crazy LMAO,
Samsung note 8 and iPhone x rocks,
no mosques in europe and usa anymore,
What a shitty update Samsung At least it will be cheap in a few short months For the bargain android shoppers,
Fastest Review Proud of this team,
I wonder if the Dex is the same model as with the S8 since ive been reading that the 2017 Gear VR Headset is not compatible with the Note 8,
 Ill buy XZ Premium anyway D,
tmobile bogo paying for my future mate 10,
Im an iPhone user and a big fan and I really like the note 8 its beautiful,

Im an iOS user but the Essential phone is the phone right now on Android That thing is gorgeous,
 1000,
How can you forget mentioning the first ever mobile to have OIS for both the cameras and an option to control the so called bookeh effect Bias anchor,
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 bomb has been planted Samsung Galaxy Note 8 bomb has been defused Counter terrorists win,
I love samsung but SERIOUSLY I was hyped about this phone and I dont see much of a differnce between this and the s8 Samsung brings back the Note 7 in the form of the FE and they didnt care to at least come with AKG headphones or something and its still priced high SMH,
screen size is too much it should be 57 enough,
screen size is too much it should be 57 enough,
There were no explosions Fires maybe but no explosions Lame drama,
Not impressed Especially for the price,
I was a samsung fan but for a year i fall for apple but now again samung i will get you soon,
i use note 3 Ill buy this after 3 years,
Apple is garbage,
Note 8 is the BOMB Literally hahahaha,
You could always multitask so idk why they keep mentioning that as a new feature,
Hello I have 2 major issues with note 8 Do you interested And no one knew this expect me,
Take my money,
In galaxy note 8 all great but if u made it like s7 edge i from menu ,
cant wait note 8,
Reviewer is unprofessional Doubt hed make this face if this were an iPhone,
Soo many isheep triggered,
Oh boy Its time to start the S9 rumor roundup,
He can be my daddy,
Yall do realise all these companies are the same in the end Just a matter of preference Dont bash Apple or joke on Note Bombings,
is it come with akg headphones,
If remapping ever become a thing I would use the bixby button for a quick picture or video,
Am iphone lover i buy iphone change every year the iphone its give me good price after sell but samsung not,
RELEASE DATE IS 0915 PREORDER TONIGHT,
What is difference between Samsung note and any other company note series phone Samsung note come with pen but other companies didnt do that Sir  Pls explain,
Its Ugly but BEAUTIFUL,
Well I think I have another priorities instead expend a lot of money for a smartphone but well this one its amazing,
S8 plus in new avatar,
S8 feels better,
I still wish they would make one in white,
Damn My pc have only 5gb ram and this note8 6gb ram,
It has a headphone jack and expandable memory Thats all that matters,
where can you get the 126gb version of the note 8,
Or Allo if youre crazy lulz,
This is the beast of the 2017 It will kill all the other phones and will be regarded as the phone of the year,
Mono or stereo speaker,
I had an iPhone 7 and I switched to an s8 and I dont regret it at all,
You can remap the bixby button,
Dont know why I am watching this,
At the beginning when he made an exploding noise was he saying his mind was blown or saying it because the phone blows up,
He sounds like hes mocking the phone the whole video,
Sad times when you have to actually rejoice about a phone having a headphone jack,
Them fingerprints on the back tho ,
I WANT IT DONT SCREW THIS UP LIKE HOW YOU SCREWED NOTE 7 _,
Hey you know who is beautiful Read the first word,
I would like to have my note with your hair color pls,
When you leave a review to an apple fan boy,
Xz Premium note 8,
decided not to wait for gallaxynote9 watching this video thx,
He forgot to mention the new hand grenade mode though xD,
FINALLY My cracked Note 5 needs an upgrade To a cracked Note 8 Yayyyy,
Now thats something to NOTEice,
Does anyone know if the paired splitscreen launch will be available on the regular s8s8 ,
Keep getting jealous by the Samsung apple fanboys,
Thank you for saying Gif properly,
So does this phone comes with the KaBoom feature,
Still think the sony xz premium is best lets see,
Hopefully the note 9 will have a home button till then Ill be sticking to my Note 7 that hasnt  will not blow up,
This is atom bomb after 7,
Hi Sorry for my english,
d i a s a p p o i n t i n g,
welp time to save up for this beast,
mehhhIm happy with my S7 edgee,
Any Nokia 3310 users,
Wow turning into apple stalling innovations,
Thought you were flicking us off here 122,
Your reviews are awesome man,
The verge guys drink way too much coffee,
i had the note 7 it was awsome but still not faster than an iphone still not as smooth as an iphone I think android will always be more clunky compared to iphones,
Will it blow ,
I wish The Verge used their power to make companies correct their mistakes Like WhatsApp,
Install BixBye and remap the bixby button to whatever you want ,
If samsung can solve the battery problem it must be perfect,
finally an upgraded bomb I mean galaxy Note device,
WaitWhat  63 inch Screen but only 3300mah battery only Let me guess SOT under 4 hours or even less,
The note 8 is mind blowing bad pun I know,
Thank you for the simple to the point video,
Wanna Hear A Joke Rip APPLE,
Sir note 8 best and unique colour please suggest,
With respect but I want to see the phone more longer time than your pretty face Please,
Ps Android kills Apple Every time,
the phone slamming champion,
I am using ad block,
in Turkey Note 8 is 1434,
Stupidest intro ever So cheesy,
So literally this is a thousand dollar gifmaker,
Theres an app called multi window tasker on the market that can be used on most devicesSo thats not actually new Still waiting for them to build a phone to do the house workmaybe next year ,
Im not a fan of the very snarky tone of this video,
People complained the s8 didnt have dual camera Now it has dual camera PeOpLe CoMpLaIn,
I love how they compared the 1year old iPhone 7 Plus camera with there just release phone and say its better,
Will i upgrade my S8  to Note 8  What you say ,
They say if youre early enough the verge will reply ,
Only 3000 mah battery,
Does it blast ,
Remind me of htc butterfly,
Im still rocking my Note 3 with a new battery and it runs great No need to upgrade New highend Android phones like Nokia 6 cost much less,
0530  We dont know yet is release date and price Umm But I anticipate release date is very soon and the price is very high  ,
Literally NO ONE asked why theyre bringing back the Note _ No one Everyone was actually looking forward to it Looking to see how Samsung was going to win over the fans that were let down by the previous Note Aside from that neat vid,
*explodes during review*,
Where is my fingerprint sensor under the display,
new paje,
whats with the cynical look  chill dude,
Sync the audio to the video,
Do a Giveaway Already And Give that to me Luv and support from INDIA,
its a impressive phone in hand,
Allo if you are crazy,
Does it have an SD card slot was the performance buggy or lag any time,
No Band 71 from TMobile,
Had these features on my iPhone 7 plus a year ago,
Nice as this device is I really hope it does not overheat or explode  Lets hope the changes Samsung made work,
507 Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this be like this,
I dont get the dislikes This seemed like a pretty legit review tbh,
Infinity display wont work to beat iphone 8  You need infinite ram,
Apple is the best  iPhone 8 will crush Samsung as usually,
I still have S7Edge and IMO S8 and N8 are really boring,
You know its a verge review when they cant stop talking about the damn iPhone  How about some comparison with other android flagships ,
I dont know kind of were waiting for this phone impatiently and it doesnt have the wow factor as the note 7 had when it initially was released At least for me By the way thank you for the early impressions review,
Mind Blowing,
silly humans making a big deal about a phone yeah aliens would definetily would take over and in slave us if they ever come to earth,
LG has been doing dual cameras since the G5 just saying not very innovative on that front,
I love my phone 3,
Looks clean and slim love the design and camera design only else,
I appreciate that Samsung removed their logo on the front Thank you Samsung This is probably by far my most favorite Android phone,
Does it explode Thats the real feature needed,
This time you cant put the stylus back in the wrong way D,
Whats new Samsung For me everything you did is on the camera and the s pen and I dont use them often,
Amazing informative video,
Thrashed the iPhone 8 before it even came out,
What is Bixby,
Meh not a great upgrade to be honest I would recommend waiting for the Pixel 2 near October,
Leaving my IPhone 7 plus to pick this up,
With this one they had time to remap the fingerprint scanner but noooo lets make everyone uncomfortable yet again with an un reachable unlocking system,
I had the note 7 with battery issues never again Samsung with their over priced poor quality products,
I can finally get back at Android users when I say these features have been on iPhone since iPhone 6,
What cant they just make one flagship that has a stylus too and call it a day instead of confusing us with multiple products that are almost identical   redundancy,
httpsyoutubeH06TbFS8SR4,
Price is about 960,
U didnt had to do that with the girl,
trash phone,
Yo Verge when u gonna make that 4K upgrade,
I love it Meet you at ifa,
I love that the camera bump is going away on phones,
What a low quality review,
007 Expected an explosion,
Does the US version come with Dual Sim version,
Background music is too loud You can barely hear the commentator,
Costs more than my laptop with insurance from square trade lol,
within 10 seconds of the video he already made the bomb joke  lmfao,
You can remap the bixbi button Do your research a little better it,
Looks beautiful But 3300 mah battery for a phone with such huge specs doesnt look impressive Note 7 used to be perfect with a smaller screen and bigger battery I dont think this will make a full day with more than regular use And no dual speakers again that lifeless bottom single grilled speakers for such a futuristic phone Holding on to the 7 looks like a better deal if not going for the 8,
Great phone but this year the s8 is the best one to me Cant wait for the note 9 lol,
And me still watching this video with the Note 3 ,
I want it so badly,
Why do always people say that the previous Exploded or it exploded  correct me if im wrong  my friend still has the Note 7 with no issues yes he still have the second update that it fixs battery from charging ,
Basically S8 with a bigger screen ,
Ive always loved the Note series but I got caught up with the Galaxy series now Probably not worth paying a grand for a phone again I might save it for the next DJI Phantom 5 Lol  jk well see,
I dont know who George Bernard Shaw is but you look like an old Stewie Stewie,
Forget about about the note 8 I cannot take my eyes away from the creases on that shirt,
When are you guys gonna make 4K video,
Will this one blow up,
contest cry determine rapidly pack baby,
*Insert Explosion Joke*,
really stupid bigsby button you cannot remap,
Nothing special Thats why he was trying to look for something to talk about,
lookif this gets recalledsamsungs just gonna send us another checkits a win win,
I will buy it if it blows up Ill buy it use it for a month then i can return in to get a refund like I did with note 7,
hopefilly no death note again ,
release date is 15 sep,
Bad Review from iVerg,
Lets be honest no one wants the next presidential debate to come Not even Google,
And Of *COURSE* it has a headphone jack,
A better name for this phone would be the Google Bezel,
Just his wise ass attitude says it all Hes an apple guy and nothing will come close to his coveted iPhone,
he realy likes that word stupendous,
Literally no one cares about thickness 100 of ppl would want a thicker phone if it means better hardwarebattery,
Are there actually people that use Google Assistant or Siri on a daily basis,
At best android phone ever and not techy like Samsung I could see what kindve a review this was gonna be,
Dude watched this review like 10 times already and maybe even more while I wait for my Google Pixel to arrive lol,
Nearly every sentence you say sounds like a question You know Cause the tone Of your voice Peace out,
this review was stupendous,
well i want to see next year Google Pixel 2nd generation to have waterproof no bezels wireless charging 256Gb storage OLED screen dual front facing speakers and 5 years of updates if it wants to WIN the fight with Samsung and Apple,
Dieter say stupendous one more time,
S T U P E N D O U S,
Could you do a battery charging test video Id like to know if it really charges entirely in 15 minutes,
Yall lost me at the second stupendous,
ATTENTION If youre a nexus OnePlus etc user complaining about this phone STOP Its not meant to be for you Its aimed at iPhone users,
The back of Pixel is such nice design while front is just meh looks like majority of chines phones That home button on iPhone is simple the best And im not Apple fanboy matter of fact I never owned any of their product,
At a starting point of 650 with no OIS no micro SD expansion no dual front facing speakers Nexus 6P or HTC One M9 take your pick they could have done it no wireless charging no waterproofing no removable battery and no exclusive feature to differentiate it are you 100 sure this is the best Android you can buy Are you sure cheaper phones like the HTC 10 Galaxy S7 or OnePlus 3 not better buys,
Useless phone motherboard issue after 15 months Google is good at fleecing customers,
Have to say great review,
344 that sponsorship tho,
I like how he said and of course there is a headphones jack,
You need to stop using word like stupendous twice in 20 seconds,
Its a good phone but here in au the 55 128gb is 1400 Ridiculous,
Looks small I wish the note was still around,
This is a really thorough review thanks,
The screen is AMOLED dimwit,
Expensive but no stereo speakers waterprotection wireless charging OIS SD slot Tango ready etc x10,
156 Im getting like 2 hours more than I get on iPhone  What kind of battery review is that,
Teddy Bridgewater is not the QB for the Vikings,
Most underrated smartphone ever I think its definitely the Nexus 4,
My god when he said and OF COURSE it has a headphone jack I died lmao,
Will google ever make their own android phone Its almost 2017,
This is the best The Verge review yet,
Its just a brother of Samsung,
Dude I think you are also VERY STUPENDOUS D,
Toe to toe head to head and stupendous,
First time Ive heard this guy give Android a compliment Good review,
This one of the best AND most truthful reviews Ive seen for anything Thank you,
stupendous,
stupendous,
watched many pixel reviews but this is the best describes how i like a phone to be described very extrovert approach and very clear narrations keep it up Verge,
Excellent review of an Android phone from verge Wow,
Ive had my xl for 3 weeks now AWESOME,
Dope review I always rely on The Verge for making great reviews and they did it this time D,
Thanks for reminding me about Vikings game today they got beaten by the eagles,
this review got me hyped for my phone to ship,
Word of the day *Stupendous*,
I had to come to YouTube to get an HTML5 video of this review because your website tried to serve me Flash Do something about it The Verge,
Right so i bought the google pixel last week Good buy previously i had the galaxy s6 edge but i broke it Id say its a better phone in my opinion I got the google pixel from wwwbrokenone It was by far the cheapest and Ive used them before so just went for it peace out YouTube ,
I love these digs at AppleAnd of course theres a headphone jack,
No mention of the resolution  How can you make a review and not mention the screen res ,
6 months review This video says best Android phone ever made Well unfortunately the battery life is poor and the Bluetooth is not friendly with Bluetooth cars,
Really simple and approachable More than 150 price difference for basic 32GB model between the UK and NL,
Cant wait for the pixel 2,
Great review Love the Pixel Hope next year they make a lower tier version aswell,
This guy sounds like the Chris Stuckmann of technology,
Google pixel is a decent phone tbh,
The quality of video of ur review is pretty damn gud,
Shouldnt you have mentioned electronic stabilization right after you mentioned no optical image stabilization,
Aand Aand Aand Aand I couldnt hear the last part for all the emphasized ands Really liked the review though,
I actually like that phone,
can I say this review was stupendous it wasnt,
beautifully shotwith some scenic backgrounds,
Yay now we have a phone that can keep track of us and knows every little detail about us,
Why did you put the date as Oct 13 Everytime my brother yells and takes my stuff and throw it at me,
Really HTC that price without front facing speakers I thought thats your specialty And also that look is NOT FINE,
omg so excited going to switch to this from iPhone 6S,
so when apple makes their phone waterproof it becomes a requirement but when sony samsung or anyone else does its just a plus,
Excelent my friend i send a hug continue with this content im exited for more videos,
It does have image stabilization  dont know how you missed that,
Hypocritically he speaks its really good but not the best talks bout camera then showing a clip of him taking pictures with flash on on a bright day hahaha you calling this a review,
Was this sponsored I know it doesnt really effect anything but I was just wondering,
I cant take this video serious with the way he is sitting,
You had me at feels like an IPhone Guess wont be returning my blue coral Note 7 after all ,
I would like Google create a machine to recycle smartphones like Apple did I was amazing Please talk about it,
I could only focus on the background twenty one pilots video for migraine,
I loved this review so much sir Its Really perfect,
Thank you this is very helpful,
yayyyyyyyyy I got pixel the camera quality is,
upgraded from the Nexus 6 Pixel is definitely the best phone out its functionality is silky smooth great camera and good speakers,
Wow the Verge is praising this phone They are right about one thing it should have been water resistant Maybe next year theyll get it right Too expensive for me right now Ill stick with my s7 edge,
Stupendous,
When I saw the 128GB XL is 1009 i ordered an Oneplus 3 Keep your perfect Android phone,
Isnt the screen AMOLED At 134 you said it was an OLED display,
Do your researchThe phone was designedbuilt and implemented by HTC,
Did Google tell you it wanted the pixel to feel like the iPhone,
holy hell that computerized voice is sounds so natural,
dont need sd card cuz all ur full rez 4k vids are directly stored in cloud but rip data charges lol,
HYPE Minnesota,
The last thing we need to do is hope it doesnt explode like the Galaxy 7 note,
The only thing stupendous about this phone is the inflated price tag,
youre not very smart are you phone,
super informative but this is an ad  not a legit review,
You are not very smart are you SAVAGE,
whoa I didnt realize how expensive these were the note 7 cost a little less then the most expensive one dam they should of just sold the big one and thats it,
DOWN WITH APPLE lol good video,
Solid phone but overpriced no water resistance and OIS,
This reviewer is good,
The production quality of this video was excellent,
Great review I may exchange my 6s for this instead of the iPhone 7,
Great review the verge is really the best I dont know I like the Pixel but I think thats just because I like iPhones and it seems like Google copied a lot about the iPhone The bezels Touch ID home button force touch long touch The google phone puts me off because it doesnt feel original  it feels like a copy cat,
Switched from iPhone 6 to this its actually a really good phone It is my first android I really like it,
101  of course there is a headphone jack on the top OH thereexist asmartphone without headphone jack,
The pixels are really big for the low light images wat,
I waiting for this years Nexus to replace my old Nexus 5 but instead they put out these monsters at 4x the price point I can afford Now Im not sure what to do to replace my old phone,
And of course there is a headphone jack on the top too much haha,
gugul gugul XD,
finally the verge is not getting paid by apple AMAZING REVIEW good job ,
No expandable microSD slot no removable battery no IR blaster  NO,
Android Authority The Verge and Marques Brownlee uploaded their reviews at the same time,
When youre waiting for him to say STUPENDOUS,
DxO Mark says its the best camera on a smartphone though,
The best review which covered details in short quick and direct way Keep it up like this more please,
LG V20 is the best Android and it doesnt look like an iPhone So GTFOH,
This review was stupendous,
Im very skeptical on that battery claim,
This is a very very good video a lot of information as well Thank you so much for the video keep them coming and you have a new subscriber,
Nextbin robins funeral is near,
47 seconds ago still no flame wars 0_0,
stupendous,
stupendous,
since Ive never ever used my phone in water or gotten any of my phones wet waterproof isnt necessary,
Did you just say 109 Samsung phones feel tacky,
Sneaking in morning  evening walks while reviewing stuff is great for health P,
Lmao you might as well just jailbreak an iPhone,
Best android ever made Wow thats pretty brave,
Word of the day Stupendous lol good review anyways,
google puts everything on the hardware side and im really impressed still the launcher got that white background now im pissed  need transparent backyy,
Grt review presentation Its vry refreshing to see both the review and pixel,
The Vikings took that L though FlyEaglesFly,
No thanks Ill stick with the OnePlus 3,
assintant is not very smart well as long im smarter than you i guess im fine,
OMG At first I wanted an iPhone SE but now I really want a Pixel But my mum will never let me since its so expensive And I live in Australia so it will be even more expensive,
Verge has the most unbiased and in depth reviews Theyre the best,
Is it OLED or Amoled screen,
STUPENDOUS whatta word,
You know it is a bad review when they call it the best android phone ever,
Stupendous,
Great review I really like how you shoot this outdoor It was a very smart thing,
I kinda enjoy your video man lol different the phone looks very interesting my wife loves to take video and that free unlimited storage falls right into her choice  would like to know about the software features besides the assistant,
The literal begins of Apple 2 and not in it just looks like an iPhone Also best phone ever Yeah okay honeymoon man calm down,
best Android phone ever made ,
Design of this phone is stupiehmmmSTUPENDOUS,
Best review on this phone Ive seen so far,
lol ronin stand at the end nice vid btw,
design same HTC one M10,
plss do RAFFLE for that plss,
Im surprised the title of this video wasnt The Stupendous Pixel lmao,
What about xSD expandable memory Im on my 4th 64gb xSD No movies Mostly research There are many places where not a cloud insight because no Internet signal Besides I want more control on how I use the phone,
How could you make a review video if you had the phone for literally three days,
feels techy Jesus man,
Someones been paid to say its the best lmaooo it doesnt touch the S7edge,
my headphones really liked that outro it sounded really nice,
this isnt the best android phone ever made dude there are plenty of other stupendous choices out there usb C jack kys,
Wouldnt it technically be designed by Google as HTC manufacturers the device,
nice review i like your style ahhahaha nice style and so beautiful voice,
The best android phone that has ever been made so how much are they paying you,
well said excellent review,
I would like to buy this phone but I cant afford it I am looking to get a phone but I am on a budget I am thinking about ZTE Axon 7 or Oneplus 3T,
I need helpShould I get the normal Pixel or is the extra money for the XL worth it And also Do I need 128 GB or are 32 just enough,
youre not very smart are you,
you just said there isnt image stableization,
Word of the day stupendous,
dude stop this phone is over priced and not compelling in the least,
Tacky Samsung phones You oubviously never held a Galaxy S7,
can the verge go with one video without mentioning apple,
Ever since The verge got new people such as this lovely person in this vid quality has gone up and are no longer biased as was the old The verge has truly got amazing thanks guys for making this amazing videos ,
i get it to teir phone but my most jaw dropping moment was the price reveal No thanks,
I had to come check out this damn phone Ive been seeing on all the ads for everything on YouTube smh,
Whaaaat round icons No way,
i need to see a speed test vs the iphone 7,
I feel like Ive just watched a documentary,
a paid advertisement not a review doesnt feel techie like a samsung phone it just feels like a smartphone  wtf  lmao,
Stupendous,
Haha iPhone always has better OS optimization,
This phone would be perfect if it had a better water resistance rating,
good cinematography but the dude is lacking,
Who would imagine that 2016 would be the year where the headphone jack would be a feature that needs to be highlighted,
1k samsung fanboys disliked this,
Its a great phone but not quite as good as S7 maybe next year The free cloud saving is a big pro for google though Im looking forward to their next phones,
I love my note 7 Too bad they want it back Excellent despite the worlds demand for a new battery,
the battery life alone sold me,
I really love quality in a video what camera gear did you use,
439 when you turn on flash in broad daylight,
640 dropping FBOMBS lol,
Of course a headphone jack Cough* Apple,
This review was stupendous,
Take a shot every time he says stupendous wiljsd jhavbe u liek,
This guy is actually a decent reviewer without any Apple favouritism,
Will the 1080p on the pixel look good in VR or do you need to get the quad hd display on the pixel xl for good looking VR,
Good review man I like the looks of this phone but its just so pricey I might as well buy an iphone 7,
It appears to me underwhelming,
Designed by Apple in California,
What a great review Would appreciate a full Camera comparison between the 7 S7 and Pixel XL,
STUPENDOUS,
I think the Pixel wins The iPhones reasons were lame compared to the Pixels The rapid charging is an amazing feature,
Cant beat the Oneplus 3 this year,
This phone is really smooth and super fast,
How is this better than an S7 Edge,
I guess everything is stupendous with this guy Imo,
Thx this really helped,
Never seen such a clean and neat review you just earned a subscriber,
why am i watching this after ordering pixel 2XL lol,
Is this the new HTC 10,
So what is the rating on a scale of 1 to stupendous,
146 Ive been trying to tell my wife that for years smh,
youre not very smart are you,
The Knockout punch would be selling it for 200 less,
its a good review in an infomercial way,
someone help after an hour or so of use my audio stops working entirely and I have to reboot it to make it play again then it repeats,
hard to justify buying this over the OnePlus three,
The Verge Anything that looks like an iphone is wonderful and the best thing ever Everything with a different idea and philosophy is terrible,
whats the name of the soundtrack at 420,
My preorder is scheduled to arrive on 1028 Im pretty excited,
The phone is good but prices are high and unaffordable,
i hope the 5X and 6P will get all the features from the Pixel,
Who Feels like the era of Skynet is approaching With all this AI moving around Having a thing know almost everything about you is very creepy and not so secure oh well it is the future,
Basically its no different or better than the Nexus 6P sheer marketing hype,
Where can I get hands on with these phones Ive always been iPhone and most likely will always be but I like trying out the competition,
can anyone please link that wallpaper,
Reasons to watch verge one reason Quality content,
Excellent Video man Even better than the phone  Want to make such videos myself I wish I could do that,
this is the best review so far,
Did google buy HTC Otherwise Google designed HTC built phone,
This guy is totally an Apple fanboy doing an Android review,
Lol at the best android phone ever made,
Pebble Time captured,
546 Everything that you shoot on the pixel gets stored in the cloud for free at full resolution FOREVER Well never take nudes with this phone,
Hmm No wireless charging no OIS single crappy speaker not water resistant no SD etc and its the best Android phone ever Nice try,
I thought she said Whats the damn time for a second,
The Pixel comes with OLED and Galaxy phones come with SuperAMOLED and Id never heard Stupendous on Galaxy I bet he never used anything other than iPhone,
If you go with the Pixel be prepared for numerous days of headaches,
flat It looks for me like deeply ubelievable jod homeless c,
Not water proofhow is this the best android phone in the market then,
Finally a phone thats a fraction thicker but has good battery life,
I love Android What can I say,
Dont need all the features the others have to be a great phone something people dwell on to much,
Does anyone think that Google wants to appeal to Apple customers more by trying to be an Apple themselves,
Yeah yeah all well and good but will it set my pants on fire No Then Im not impressed,
Request politics deserve wildlife,
Within confront variation because PM,
What is cloud storage capacity for this phone if its free Apple provides 5Gb for free and 50Gb for purchase at 099 a month,
The first google phonr yet what about nexus,
Thanks for the review,
obi wan kenobi ,
it knows and records what you are searching it stores you images for ever and has screen sharing so they can watch you sleeping,
I do wish theyd have SD card storage options If Im paying 700 for a phone Im going to be keeping it for a while and the internal storage is never enough Especially with mobile gaming getting better and better,
First generation of made by google phone Next pixel phone is going to be soo goood,
honestly i think the oneplus 3 is better overall,
Most helpful review of all of the ones Ive seen so far I especially liked your closing statements Its not a clear winner but it holds its own and it is only the beginning,
Lets say google is finally on the right track AGAIN,
who else noticed pier 40,
227 Not WaterproofNO PHONE IS WATERPROOF iPhone 7 Water RESISTANT ip67 or S7 Water RESISTANT ip68,
So I saw an article saying that you can get this phone on different carriers like sprint ATT and tmobile is this true,
Its got a headphone jack Fatality,
too bad the iphone 7 spanks it on geekbench scores,
The fact that it has the headphone jack at the top is a deal breaker for me,
this phone looks great im always somewhat hesitant to buy a new version of a phone or especially the first phone ever put out by a company but i may just pull the trigger on this one im an android guy so apple holds no appeal to me and not really impressed with anything samsung or htc has out,
The best review ive ever watched,
How many times does this dude say stupendous D nice review budd,
Stupendous said twice in one review Hmmmmm,
Wait I must have heard it wrong but didnt be say it didnt have image stable and then later on he said it did,
GOOGLE didnt make the hardware HTC did and they took all the credit,
Hi I a new sub can you review the Armphone 0A520P its new entered the market and i couldnt find English reviews to it  thanks  ,
Never one made by Google Nexus,
what city are you in lol,
stupendous review,
Is there an SD card slot,
didnt Google make the Nexus,
google did make a phone before it was called the google nexus,
Stupendous,
Before the 2 minute mark I find this review biased,
i thought htc is manufacturing ,
Stupendous lol,
very highly biased he said that speaker was good WTF,
no dual sim no party,
is this phone gonna blow up too please,
Hey the ear bud jack is on the top Time to get those coolcure earbud jack dust stoppers from amazon lol,
I would buy it if it have better Design and Specs for the same price,
the glass makes it resemble the android logo sort of,
stupendous,
Andriod for me is Touchwiz ,
One of the best reviews Ive seen all year I was convinced that I wasnt buying this phone But hes making me change my mind Especially when he mentioned battery being great,
And I got a pixel ad on this vid,
literally sell out review,
Its a good start Ill pass on this one but the next Pixel hopefully smaller bezels will be the better choice,
Those crossed legs say a lot,
You got me with the headphone jack,
This phone still holds up amazing today other then the lack of water resistance,
I saw the stand for the gimbal at 618 u guise I definitely saw that Its right there,
but only on Verizon,
So basically they ripped off Apple,
This review is stupendous,
This review is stupendous,
I like the Pixels pictures and video but that is all subjective anyway I dont own it nor ever used it but from all the videos like this that Ive seen it does a great job,
On project fi how do I upgradetrade in my Nexus 6P,
but its not an exciting design,
Its not even cheaper as the iPhone So you become second class and pay first class,
They shouldve just put TouchID in the Apple logo,
I meen this guy is trying to unlock his phone by looking at it by the height of his hip Like wtf are you expecting to unlock,
iPhone x has a top notch display,
All the footage trying to prove that the Face ID doesnt always work just shows you holding the phone near your waist I mean Im sure theres a range where it probably wont pick up your face Also SIM tool in the box ,
Thank you I more like keep my money on the bank card,
Honestly the 8 plus is the better buy,
Its all about the Samsung screen Hilarious,
iPhone x x stands for experimental Apple is trolling before the next one,
I buy iPhone for the design and the software I will never buy an Android Go ,
Great review No bullshit Just honest thoughts Im ditching the X for iphone 8 It makes no sense to me especially when they are almost the same bench spec wise And  I then dont have this awkard top notch just because Apple wanted to be different *eyeroll* The only thing I like about the X is the new home button concept it is pretty nice usability wise and offers many possibilities Face recognition had Samsung already 15 year earlier and augmented reality had Sony in 2016 with Xperia I think it is pretty cool but makes still no sense to me right now There is still no real use of augmented reality maybe in a few years when there is actually better hardware and also use cases Anyway its a cool feature to play with but I dont throw a grand just because of this even if I could,
When you get a Samsung S8 ad before watching this,
Animojis look cool Not sure if 1K cool though,
how to fix you face id problem put it at neck level or jaw level not at hip level omg,
sony xz1 4k is the best phone display ever made even beating samsungs oled because even when it is set for 1080P in down scales so well text and everything is super sharp much better than the 1080P and 750P lcds on the iPhone or samsung oled But the thing is most youtube reviewers never have them side by side and it is a battery drainer of course at 4K and bezels  I like your honest review looks like so far the note 8 lg v30 Mate 10 and upcoming U11 plus are the great flagships this year Maybe next year Apple will have all of the bugs ironed out And settle with qualcomm so we can get the best bluetooth hires audio codecs for the next wireless airpods and beats as the current ones have none and some of the fastest cell phone downloads with qualcomm lte 5 gigabit,
GREAT REVIEW I love you showed us that not everything is perfect about the iPhone X not like other youtubers saying everything is just awesome about it just because they got the phone for free,
036 look the guy with a gopro LOL,
I mean X is alright but not the greatest i still think Samsung Note 8 or S8 is more high tech,
How good is the I phone x camera vs a good quality dslr,
I would really love to see footagea review of the iPhone X using MOMENT lenses specifically for video before I make the purchase myself ,
Anything short of an unequivocal wow for Face ID would be a bit of a warning sign at this point Thats too bad,
The Verge no 1440p 2160p seriously,
Animojis are the best feature of the phone actually that doesnt sound good,
First great review that didnt follow what seems to be a script like other youtubers Looking forward to your other updates iPhone X videos,
iPhone Xpensive,
If samsung said no to apples offer there would be know iphone x Im jus saying how ironic it is I love these 2 companies,
Galaxy S8 is the phone of 2017,
Wow Are reviewers only getting 24 hours with this thing because production issues are that bad,
who else is just binge watching a bunch of iphone x first impressions,
How good were the first gen products from Apple on a scale from one toone,
200 mins in the video you can see that great battery life,
Anyone notice the dude at 040 just messing with the equipment,
5145 mails Holy Crap I Barely get 5 mails Lol,
Oooohhh Classic bias from The Verge,
Im Android all the way but this phone has changed my mind Im preordering on Xfinity Mobile,
YEAH 5000 and some more notifications Great way of telling someone to read their stuff,
What if Im playing Temple run and swipe up to jump Will it go to the home screen,
DAAAAMMMNNN YOU Ive avoided seeing the Star Wars trailer up until now,
Are the home button gestures practical,
What will the picture look like when you take a screenshot will the notch be visible or the picture wont be regular,
Please make a review And I want a camera comparison bw pixel 2 xl and x,
Watching this from a S8 plus ,
Probably the most unbiased video so far Great job Nilay and Verge,
Hey Nilay you just mentioned in the vlog that iphone X took some time to open with face id in the sun light What about that can you please tell me in brief if possible Thank You,
Kind of regretting the space gray color thats coming on Friday damn,
Got to say Im disappointed you glossed over the front facing camera performance From other vids posted today it looks absolutely atrocious at portrait mode,
What about the camera bump on the back It seems weird that it wont lay flat when you put it down,
24 hours isnt enough Look at Casey Neistat,
Its like Monday Well is it,
Framework platform violate like ceiling yes,
037 isnt there a SIM tool in the box,
great vid can you expand more on the FaceID issues in the sunlight in the full review,
When reviewing 1000 smart phone by the end of 2017 are you reviewing a product or a religion,
Thanks for your quick honest review Nilay,
Never buy a 1st gen Apple product NEVER,
The 1000 emoji machine good job apple,
Cant wait for the Samsung galaxy s9,
Another X in white Lol is there an earlyreviewer agreement with Apple to only review the white one,
Apple  We designed and developed the screens ourselves  Samsung  Yea  yeah  of course,
lol Thats apple for you they even screwed up there anniversary phone edition,
My question is can the Face ID be disabled Is there a Touch ID mode on the display since theres no longer a home button Face ID might be a deal breaker for me,
Thanks for the honest review unfortunately it confirms what I thought about this phone I think I will wait a while,
Camera bump is sooooooo ugllyyyyyyy,
Get two identical twins to check if FaceID works on both of them for the full review,
Ive got it Ive got the Iphone X and a random guy snatches it from him and runs off Could have been viral,
Apple didnt design an amoled display at all they literally sent Samsung the dimensions required for their phones and thats it,
Theres a SIM card pin in the box itself,
waiting for a 47 inch edge to edge iphone then I will buy it Meanwhile my 7 is doing great,
Thank you Now I will spend my 1000 wisely on drugs instead of this,
LG V30  iPhone X X reminds me of the FirePhone ie mostly gimmicks ,
Thank you so much Could you please ask apple about the effect of flashing all that light in the viaible and invisible spectrum to our faces Thanks,
Apple developed the OLED display and Samsung just manufactured it iPhone LCD display is the best display ever,
That gimbal with the gopro went crazy cmon you guys ,
after a few hours I forgot about the notch Then goes on a 2 minute rant about the notch and screen size Verge trying to make best of a overpriced Samsung Galaxy wannabe,
I know that the front camera has 7 mp like iphone 8 but is there any different in image quality regardless the boka effect,
Thank you for the good review I just need more detailed review on face ID in different situations like you did and different angels,
When you said muted display You mean like pixel 2 or pixel 2 XL ,
The end credits scene with you and Joanna was funnycute I loved when she was part of the Verge,
animojis are probably the best feature of the phone Sounds like a great reason to spend 1000,
annimogis are the best part of the phone  Okay yeah,
Animoji best feature in this phone really ,
Hi Nilay What is the user available memory on 64GB and 256GB variants,
037 damn the GoPro stabilizer,
Is apple likely to launch IPhone with pencil stylus next year ,
Animoji are probably the best feature on the phone,
Shocking a phone that isnt even released doesnt have fully optimized apps,
1400 for the note8 yeah no,
Stop lying it is a good phone but not the best ever made it is still in beta this first year This is simply not true VERGE The iPhone X is clearly the best iPhone ever made Its thin its powerful it has ambitious ideas about cameras and it pushes the design language of phones into a strange new place As of now the iPhone 8 plus is superior,
How the hell do u have 200 phone notifications,
I love how the Verge is becoming less Apple Fanboy now,
Thanks for the honest review,
My guitar is more expensive than this I can buy 5,
In my country nobody uses iMessage can you use animoji on WhatsApp,
I would be so protective when ever I carried this phone anywhere,
Ive spent quite some times on a research using xbox kinect back then when I was on college And yes I can assure you those kind of IR setup will not going well on sunny days,
How is the experience with the phone with full screen videos Not only through the YouTube app but with stuff from your iTunes Library,
Lmao dude compliments Samsungs display on this phone and then insults the display of the Galaxy S8,
The notch and lack of touch ID kills it for me I really dig the size size  gestures With a more uniform look at the top and a fingerprint sensor on the back of under the screen youve got a winner Full disclosure Im posting from my v30 which I wish shared the same dimensions as the x,
530 notice that he said a really good iPhone NOT a really good PHONE LOL,
Can you test the fast charging I want to see how fast it charges before I invest in the USBC adapter,
When Animoji is your best feature ,
Road block number  its not like you have a Sim ejection tool included in the box,
animojis which are super silly and i think probably the best feature of the phone not faceid not the screen not the camera an emoji system is the best feature lol,
That bar from the screen killed it from me guessill save my cas,
What is the size of the actual usable screen excluding the notch part On videos what is the size of the pillarboxed and letterboxed videos,
Apple promises you that if you spend a grand on a cellphone your hands will grow bigger guaranteed You will not miss the reachability feature that died along with the home button,
You just got a new boxthere is a sim tool included ,
Aww that poor camera man with the gopro gimbal hahah,
So in most cases the 58 display looks like a 5  How is a video filmed with the phone playing on the phone same borders added,
Will i be able to order the iphone X after release date from a carrier and have it shipped to my house or the store within less that a month,
The notch is really going to hurt the likability of this device when watching videos Really unfortunate since OLED is really exciting to finally have on iOS,
Waiting for you quick answers so that i can plan,
Heres the verdict with iPhone Xs Face ID 524,
Is it worth buying I per order my thought Comcast,
Welp Glad i got the 8 plus,
I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK GREAT JOB Can YOU PLEASE SEND ME THAT SPACEGRAY VARIANT I WANT IT BUT DIDNT GOT ,
Hahah another iPhone I wont buy *laughs in OnePlus *,
Thanks verge great advertising you helped me to save 1000 dollars Its like I won in the lottery thank you guys  Love you,
How its the sound quality of the speakers 25 louder than the iPhone 7Plus,
best feature of the phone animojis WTF,
That black notch is a deal breaker for me And the forced face id feature Super hyped for the phone after this,
I appreciate that this video was way less OH MY GOD ITS THE IPHONE X EVERYTHING IS AMAZING EXACTLY LIKE THEY SAID IT WOULD BE OMG I LOVE YOU APPLE YAY than some of the others Ive seen,
Do you setup your face outside as well That would fix it,
In my s8I dont need to stretch my thumb to bottom just to back home what a TECHNOLOGY isjustsayin,
24 hours is not long enough for you to figure out battery life,
Havent ordered yet Debating on waiting a couple months to get everything running smooth app optimization FaceID improvement software updates or pulling the trigger now,
V I R T U A L B E Z E L S,
Pattern lock os better than face id,
Thanks for nothing Get back to us when youve done a full review,
If you are thinking of getting the 8 plus than get the 7 plus instead its not worth the upgrade,
Hey Sir Just please do a camera comparison between iPhone X and Google pixel 2 xl,
wit that notch how can u say it hs a beautiful screen,
Finally an honest and real review Thank you,
Whats the battery life comparable to the pixel 2 XL with a full day of use,
Can you try to unlock by using face id after wearing a spec As apple said the phone will still recognise the user even when the user is wearing other things or different hairstyle etc,
IPHONE X IS X_PENSIVE BUT GONNA BUY IT ANYWAY,
You didnt mentioned speaker quality,
How do you access reachability For one handed use Also is one handed use easy on the iPhone X,
That notch will soon became a first world problem for sure,
Actually a real review lol Bravo,
Some good review The X is amazing we absolutely love it We have the iPhone X in both colors and have 2 apple leather cases on our channel We also have a lot of upcoming comparison and review videos of the phones,
Most honest early review yet Happy I grabbed an 8 plus instead,
Night and low low light pic comps with the Pixel 2 and S8 please,
Biggest question Would Arya Stark be able to hack Face ID,
How is the iPhone Xs memory management Seems like with iOS11 or the A11 Bionic chip apps arent kept in the background as long as before referring to Phonebuffs speed test videos with the iPhone 8 phones whereas iPhone 7 phones managed to keep more apps in the background Could be a software issue can be managed with a software update just wondering how things fare with the iPhone X now Thanks you guys,
Actually when you multitask you dont have to tap on the upper red buttons to delete opened appsyou can also swip up like before to,
If emoji is the best feature of a phone I worry if its worth the price they ask for it,
thickness comparison and alsothe space grey version,
Will it be hard to adjust to the smaller screen if Ive been used to the 6 plus for 3 years I have big hands and the screenkeyboard on the plus is perfect Is the X really that much smaller,
Why didnt you just use the sim pin in the box You didnt have a paper clip to put sim in They give u a pin in the box,
No thanks Apple can keep their one thousand dollar box,
Its funny because while youre talking about the iPhone x screen being so good you pan past the 8 plus which looks 100 times better than the x,
If i do buy this phone it will be my first iphone Would u recommend i stick with android,
Honest initial reviewinstead of all the other guys showing only positive points,
iPhone X is a topnotch phone,
All the triggered Samsung fans,
The ending was gold gold gold I loved it,
the designers told during the launch that the face id will improve its accuracy as the time progresses can you plz confirm that,
If it has no home button how do you exit appsclose apps from running in the background,
Leave us your questions and comments below and well try to address as many of them in our final review as we can,
Looks like my S8,
Georgous phone and a nice first impression But Face ID doesnt work outside properly And emojis that follow your face Plus no headphone jack no home button not spending 1000 plus on this LOL forget it,
Why does the IR dot projecter blink or is it just the camera,
in utopia i called the attack war history 12 first war second war 10 war history from my attackerexplorer avian first war 14K land land gain second war 28K land gain,
My wife and I both have our fingerprints on each others phone so we have access How does face id work for this,
Hi does the battery percentage show up on the top corner,
Great video by the way however I recently just got the iPhone 8 and was wondering is it a good idea to upgrade to iPhone X this soon or should I wait,
Test Face ID while making funny faces,
Does YouTube go to the full screen like videos,
Apple This is the future Me where it at tho,
So what happens if the screen cracks and the LCD breaks Also what alternates are there to opening your phone without face recognition,
When you buy a 1000 dollar phone and you have questions about it Thats not good,
Steve wouldnt have never let a incomplete feature to be relased,
The ending is best ,
What about if star drizzle and the screen got wet the touch work well  theverge,
lmfaoooo so apple is copying andriods i remeber having an andriod from metroPCS and one password option was a faceunlock,
Less usable space than the 8 plus Ill wait for the 11 plus when theres way more usable space and all the bugs are worked out The inconsistency in the face ID alone is a deal breaker for me What were they thinking Do they think we just use this as a toy,
If you setup FaceID outside would it work better outside,
Is Face ID faster  better than Touch ID,
waiting on the battery life test with normal use Also if you can test how fluid or fast it would be to get to multitask now that the home button is gone Thanks,
Hows the face id work at night Is it a good,
Apple over complicated something that worked great for years,
Regarding the face ID not working great outdoors it reminds me of the TV remote not working right if sunlight is shining directly on the IR receiver on the TV Sounds like Apple still got work to do in that department,
does faceID work with SUNglasses on,
Upgrade worthy coming from the iphone8plus Same specs just slightly diff camera and screen,
Its samsung made phone with apple logo,
Hey I want to know how to enter guided access It used to be triple click home button,
I want one my bank account said no,
Dont buy this phone for another 6 months Unless you really like going on a discovery of FaceID,
009 when u pass by iPhone X though it still hasnt been released and u dont stare at it,
Camera guy in car,
The Verge doesnt even know that theres always a SIM tool in the box,
How do the new gestures feel Also please mention how outrageous it is that they dont include a fast charger with a 1000 phone It s a freaking joke that part,
Will face ID work with twins will it work if i wear sunglasses Will it work if I growshave my hairbeard,
Apple There is always a compromise,
I think its because you had your face scared in a dark place,
Id love to see a speaker comparison of the 8 plus and 7 plus Im wondering if the speakers work better when they are wet vs the other phones,
1000 animoji machine sorry but my note 8 is waaaaaayyyyyy better,
Is it easier to accidentally purchase appsinapppurchases since all you have to do is look at your phone,
Takes about 35 hours to fully charge the iphone Xonly 1 hour to fully charge the Samsung S8WIN,
Is the 8plus a better phone for business and work done or not ,
What if someone wants to just see the notifications on the lock screen and not unlock the phone itself,
NAHH I LOVE MY GOOGLE NEXUS,
The clip to open sim card slot is included in packaging,
why did you buy  if u have so many problems with iphone ,
Wait no sim ejector in the box,
Nice phone but honestly still very expensive Still on that first gen of that 6,
Why is everyone defending Face ID fails when hes actually using the device and youre not  Citing the distance etc How about when youre driving and the phone is To your side or dash How about when you live somewhere sunny  or youre in a deli with weird lighting  Lets be transparent Touch ID was amazing  Having a headphone jack was amazing  Change for the sake of change is obnoxious and only hurts the end user  Happy I opted for the 8 plus ,
Im pretty sure Apple products are made by vampires because all their screens are terrible comparatively under sunlight,
So at 550 youre telling us its good if we ordered a 1000 mobile phone to be alpha  and beta testers Cool,
The guy with Go Pro is hilarious,
You should of asked them why they give you headphones and the phone doesnt have a headphone jack,
Broken functionality  journeydiscovery,
How is the oled panel Any blueshift,
now i know to wait for s9 thanks buds,
Yea not mad at all for buying the 8 plus instead lol,
Great work Question How is reachability addressed on the X For the size is it inconvenient to reach for the ears single handed for the swipe down,
I think I made a bad decision preordering this phone,
Next year innovation will be removing the notch at the topD,
display is made by Samsung Steve Jobs is spinning in his grave,
couldnt apple pack a fingerprint senor into the apple logo would be dope in my mind at least,
That guy with the go pro was having the time of his life Lol,
this guys such a tool lol,
So its now an Androidminus the expandable memory flexibility and costs twice to three times as much Brilliant The best part is the Fanboys will never know Apple is genius at taking your money,
IPhone X should have been the iPhone 8 and the price should have been the same as the iphone 8 There is absolutely nothing new in the iPhone X and the competitors have been making phones without bezels for over a year Before anyone buys this product they should try a Note 8 for 5 minutes and consider what exactly are they getting for the extra dollars in the iPhone X just saying,
I think soon with the X they should just make the area surrounding the notch a permanent status bar so we can finally know the time without having to budge with our Youtube,
The notch Killed this iphone Period,
All the unboxing of the iphone x on youtube are the white version and the box in already openhmmm,
Could you try the FaceID feature with sunglasses,
Does the True Tone LED light effect the cameras at all when ur using for videos or flash photography,
Shoutout to ESSEN,
Not comfortable screen,
Question how do you confirm purchases of apps in the AppStore,
oh please hes barely looking at it like look at the distance and consistency hwe know that there must be a stare into the top notch sl that it works well ,
I would rather spend 1000 on apple fruit ,
only like it for info ,
Samsung made the iPhone screen Samsung rocks,
face id is too slow,
galaxy note 8 is best,
Best notch i ve ever seen notchgate,
I wont be getting this iPhone but hilarious video man,
What would happen if you set up FaceID out in the open,
FaceID will be a huge failure for apple I hope it wont but it will,
I havent used an iPhone since the iPhone 4 It has always been Note series for me but I may get the iPhone 10 as a backup to my Note8,
Paperclip First time you got an iphone,
Just wait for the Iphone XI,
Although this is a cool phone I seriously doubt it would be great to use daytoday no jack screen notch no fingerprint scanner,
Samsung phone are so great that its owners always get a itch in their hole which gets satisfied only by blasting apple rather than just being happy and using their phone You guys coming here and blasting apple proves how unsatisfied you all are with samsung products and roam here and there trying to prove a point,
Best review so far,
Will face face id work when u r sleeping n someone try to open the lock by your face,
Great review buddy,
Saw a couple of initial reviews that just focused on the pros thus I think its great that you touched up on the cons,
I have just one question  are you keeping this one or the 8 Plus,
What happen if the iPhone X will drop how much they will take money to fix that Is the screen is enough strong to take drop 23 time easily,
How about the double tap gesture to lower the screen how does that work on the X,
I got my Blackberry KEYone Hell of a phone for 550,
You know these features are awesome but Im looking for a really useful versus of x and note 8 and I surely expect that from the Verg Thanks Please zoom on the camera for versus,
Inserting a SIM card is hardly an operation,
Good honest first impression,
Ill probably start with the 8 then wait and compare and contrast with my X users and see in detail the deferences,
Notch is weird face id doesnt work great camera almost the same um so wheres the future,
Its not my kind of phone Ive switched over to Android since the iPhone 3GS and I havent seen any version of iPhone worth switching back,
Can you add multiple faces,
Im From Ecuador i need a sim free phone do you know when it is coming,
I love apple but I wont buy the x because i just love the fingerprint id,
The most honest man out there Great review  I love verge ,
Did you honestly say the animoji are the best feature of this phone,
Bump that Iphone X A 1000 for a phone Man that phone betta pay my phone bill for all i care,
I would like to know 1 What is the black bar made of Is it protected by the glass or is it metal As I am afraid minor hair scratch or dirtfinger smuges there will break face id 2 The gestures to close apps can you easily do them with one hand 3 When using the phone do you feel the camera bump as it seems massive 4 XD just out of curiosity does face id work when you hold the phone upside down,
Could you possible hold the phone any farther away from your face when testing FaceID No wonder it doesnt work its barely out of your pocket,
i dont understand why people waste money trying to upgrade anyway a phone is a phone and they all do the same thing pretty much im fine with my 6s plus and galaxy s7 edge,
The FACE ID problems HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH Good job apple hahahhaah,
This review is nuts How would you expect Face ID to work if you are holding your phone like half the size of your height,
Apple fan here Been looking for an honest review since the first impressions video dropped over the last 2 days Most of them seem exceptionally biased and dont talk about the obvious cons of the phone like that darn notch The major turn off is that thing and if most of my videos look weird or Ill have to shrink it into some weird smaller dimension I dont think its worth the 1000 price tag at all esp when I watch a lot ot YouTube and Netflix on my current iPhone Im basically compromising functionality for a design flaw And most developers will have a serious headache getting apps to look good with that notch Guess Ill skip this gen,
Waste Apple was about simplicity now theyre more of ,
the gestures They look to me to be really anoying to use Seems like the home button to do a lot of these actions just seemed easier and more intuitive How anoying is the missing home button I really feel llike they should just use an onscreen home button like android if they are going to go this route,
Did he just say animoji is the best feature of the phone at 412,
I cannot believe how apple handled how videos are displayed Heres a shiny big new screen buuuut we are gonna shrink everything down to hide our awful design,
Wait theres an 8,
if the face ID is not working properly and the screen is not very usable how come you say it is the best iphone,
Hows the battery life given the OLED screen,
is there other way to lock and unlock the phone aside from face id,
Watching this on my Nokia 3310,
by the time they do a proper review new phones will be released,
The worst part You buy a over 999 dollars phone and than you havent got app optimization,
Pick the phone up man face Id isnt gonna work by glancing down at it like you did in the video,
Cant compete with S8 haha,
If the face ID is not work in the light you have to do manually,
Just buy Note 8 You get more of your phone in the same value,
If apple designed and engineered the screen why didnt they just build it themselves,
Such a precise video You answered all the questions I had Like the display notch display quality and the face ID consistency Watched so many other videos including MKBHD and the likes but none spoke about it as clearly as you did Great Job man Loved it all the way,
How does the screen compare to the gritty pixel 2 screen,
Note 8 the beast love it,
Finally a guy that knows about technology and talks about it This short review was even better than Brownlees,
THAT NOTCH IS UNFORTUNATE UNFORGETTABLE UNFORGIVABLE,
Why dont you pick the phone up to your face dont worry it wont judge you lol,
When are you gifting me iPhone 10,
Bring back touch ID under the screen,
I just went from a 6 to an 8plus and I miss the ability to use my phone with one hand,
Great reviews Keep it up you guys are my no1 go to for reviews For the IPhone X any idea how does Apple Pay work Also if you are asking Apple are there plans in the future to roll out Apple Pay for non Apple devices,
Can face id work for twins,

DONT CALL IT IPHONE 10 *thinks of team 10* yeah i am sticking with the X,
can you please try Face ID with a girl that wears heavy make up in the first setting but tries Face ID when she has no make up on and changes her hairstyle,

527 Bruh,
Lmao unboxed phone and puts it face down,
oled will eventually leave burn spots,
Im just sayin I feel like since Steve Jobs died Apple has become more of a fashion statement rather than a practical phone companywhich is not good since most people use there phone as a tool not a piece of jewelry,
This my dream phone maybe its just a dream to have this i can never buy so expensive,
They should of put Face ID and Touch ID not just one smh,
Omg I got a iPhoneX and I had no idea how to use it until I watched this video thank you,

2160p Squad,
Opens iphone and then tells us that the screen is great which is not even made by Apple Compare it with other Android phones which are not being sold for 1000 dollars Yeah 999 dollars whatever,
I think that it had better for them to make the apple mark as a fingerprint sensor,
iPhone X camera is preety bad,
so beautiful I want this,
That is soo last year,
The change in aspect ratio makes the 58 screen of iPhone X smaller than the 55 screen of iPhone 678,
Is that a deadmau5 shirt,
Is it just me or someone that noticed that theres a name on his messages written Dwayne Johnson,
The intro music reminds me of Logan Paul,
Look I both enjoy Samsung and Apple I personally love the iPhone 10 and the Samsung S8 equally and I think they are as good as each other People need to learn how to respect other peoples opinions and stop squabbling over phones So be happy for the Apple fanboys and be happy for the Samsung fanboys Edit Thanks for the support guys Really nice comments  and 30 likes,

Congrats MKBHD your video had reached 10 Million views Its a record,
Can you show how a screenshot works with the notch Also how video cropping works in standard HD and Widescreen Comparing screen size to 8 and 8 Plus along with body size One hand usability as well as if its more comfortable to use in one hand or the other because of placement of control center leftright swiping gestures etc Im a lefty and would like to know if I need to learn to use my phone in my right hand What does hiding the notch with wallpaper modification look like and how might we go about doing it apps etc Not sure if you have the other color but how much do fingerprints and scratches show in general and from color to color,
Im getting my iPhone X today and Im so excited,

Note 8 is the King,
*iPhone X*,
Okay 243 anybody else notice Dwayne Johnson on the text list,
Im over here still with a iPhone 6s,
Scratch test a face to see if its still gonna unlock,
Usa ty price of iPhone x,
Just got the iphone 7  its definitely helping me lose weight  now i have no money to eat for 2 months,
Mannn 700 Airplane mode better take me to dubai,
So glad the XS is out now I can get the iPhone 7,
800 iPhone 7 no wireless charging 30 electric toothbrush has wireless charging,
dont wanna sound like a weirdo but i enjoy watching your fingers,
Im getting a 7 plus and Im finding it really hard to decide whether I want black or jet black,
jet black is so overrated I dont get the hype bc matte black is so much more sleek,
I wish I could hold 2 phonestalk about how they lookand get 8 million views,
iPhone 6 128GB was the worst iPhone ive ever owned I got it replaced 4 times under apple care from hardware issues to cosmetic quality control problems Got the 7 in jet black I dont regret it at all,
im soo glad that iphone 7 is finally out  now i can afford a iphone 4,
iPhone 8 removes wifi and replaces it with apple iFi iPhone 9 removes all standard mobile network connections like 3g and replaces Them with iMobile iPhone 10 removes screen and replaces it with iDisplay iPhone 11 adds 349mm iAudio Jack iPhone 9001 solid block of glass that gets implanted into your brain,
guys just telling telling you the iPhone 8 will have no charging port so when it runs out of battery you have to throw it out and buy a new one,
Currently watching this on my brand new iPhone 6 feeling unthankful as hell,
Is it wrong to watch this on my iPhone XS ,
lol when you said hey Siri my Siri went off nice video,
Anyone after the launch of iPhone x,
S7 edge looks very small in your hands,
110 I came,
I would buy a iPhone just to peel the plastic off of the box and the phone,
I got an IPhone 7 today,
DudeYour a LEGENDYour my HEROYour my INSPIRATIONYou areDope,
I got the jet black for Christmas yesterday and it actually looks a lot better in person and it has a nice premium feel to it,
Matte black or jet black Mehand black,
Who else hates this new comment section,
Lmao Wen he Said Hey Siri My Siri Popped Up,
Wish Steve was here he was a great man,
The jet black box looked like an iPhone 5 box,
Not if you lose your dongle  but  when you lose your dongle Fing Apple way to screw people into either using your lameass headphones or constantly having to hunt for dongles,
Why are you even watching this we both know we are broke af,
Its really worth to go for in 2018 I brought it from my known as 2nd hand and it impressed alot Performance too impressive,
i thought it was gonna be a troll i thought the jet black was the iphone 3g at first,
I dropped and Cracked My Jet Black Trying to Take off the peel,
Matte black all the way dont understand all the hype behind the jet black,
Jet Black looks like an iPhone 3G throwback,
when apple announced iphone7 they wanted to push to the future and combine everything to one single port and now in the macbook proevery single port is a usb type C portwhich is the future so why did apple go with the stupid lightning port on the iphone 7 instead of usb C ,
When he said hey siri my Siri responded,
The iPhone 7 is worth it,
IF I EVER SAY ILL REMOVE THE HEADPHONE JACK JUST KNOW I MEAN IT Tim Cookie,
Im surprised apple didnt make iGloves for the jet black iPhone and sell it for 4799,
I speak trump nation,
How do you make ur intro dude i love it,
Why still no review,
I phone is the best,
MATTE BLACK SQUAD ASSEMBLE,
In 4K you can lift Marquess fingerprints lol,

when i bought this phone and unboxed itit felt like orgasmes on my hand,
Real nice  the Mercedes of phones Absolutely gorgeous,
I speak English hahahahahaha Man your video is great,
Everybody complaining about the no headphone jack meanwhile the Samsung phones are exploding,
Have crApple invented a way to send files to other devices via Bluetooth yet I swear every time I use an iPhone I find out another basic task that it cant do,
The JetBlack is the Amazing ONE,
You have to be the best reviewer about mate Keep it up Top man,
When he said hey Siri I wasnt wearing headphones Siri wassup,
MATTE BLACK,
The iPhone 7 should have a magnetic charger like the MacBook,
who just watch the I phone 1 vid and like wow apple good job,
If Apple made a car would there be Windows,
Was that IJustines S7 Edge on the left side,
Waiting for the Full Review on Iphone 7 Also inform abt the space storage is the 32GB good or not,
I LOVE this guys intro The tune is just so chill,
He said big ol forehead,
Am I the only one that doesnt like the jet black color,
The 2phone Kevin gates intro oml,
I got the jet black,
I bought ip7 matte black 32gb It really good design and good color,

iPhone 5 was one of the best  Im sure iphone 7 would have been better if steve jobs was still there,
YOU HANDS THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL,
apple didnt remove the headphone jack to create more internal space for the iphone 7 and 7 plus THE JACK WAS REMOVED BECAUSE THAT JACK IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN THE WATER PROOF,
to anyone that uses a samsung galaxy s7 edge do you find the side bezels on the iphone 7 really big and distracting,
putted phone air plane mode i threw it didnt fly ,
i liked the way he kept the ringer on silent just for that coloured button feel true pixel 2 lover,
Hahahaha Kevin Gates2 phone 008,

Need help just got mine its taking 10hrs to upload my info not even close to being done what is going on,

I will use 6s as long as 2 more years Coz i have Oneplus 3T as secondary phone and a alienware 17so dont want to fiddle around with that adapter standard 35mm jack is my personal requirement,
UPE E B,

I phone is the best,
Gift Me a iPhone 7 bro ,
When he said hi Siri it enabled mine,
I bought the iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB Jet Black,
Can you do a giveaway with those phones,
Speaking of rare times Apple sells something in a black box I still have my 3rd generation iPod box,
someone pls tell me that intro song pleasseeeee mkbhd,
For all those complaining about the headphone jack 1 If you arent getting the iPhone 7 stop bitching what do you have to worry about 2Very rarely will you be in a situation where you need music and charging at the same time 3You can still use your regular headphone jack the adapter comes in the box FOR FREE Also everyone making AUX cord jokes you can still pass the AUX cord,
whats the intro song,
Soon the next cars would have a bluetooth instead of oxcord,
when he said hey siri  300 my iphone opened siri,
When he said Hey Siri Did Siri come up on anyone elses phone Lol,
When he said hey sirimine got activated,
I see you Galaxy S7 edge,
love the intro,
Idk why I watched this i cant even afford an Iphone,
Yo that matte black is BEAUTIFUL,
watching all unboxing videos because your excited to finally get your iPhone after waiting over 4 months for it,

Vay gzelmi,
Oh sweet lord thankyou for blessing us with the red dragon,
when a phone has more power than your phone,
Whats the song during his intro,
Bought a jet black 7 plus and Im mad that I didnt get the matte black,
How do people afford it I can just about afford iPhone 5s When iPhone 9 comes out I might be able to afford 6,
Have the iPhone 7 its not a bad phone overall camera is much better than I expected especially in low light but the day to day performance was the star of the show The fusion chip is insanely fast O,
Lmao you triggered my phone when you said hey Siri,
y si me lo regalas en lo personal me gusta ms el jet Blake,
Is there a difference in music quality using normal headphones on a 6s plus and the adapter on the 7 plus,
Its weird to think that in like 5 years we will think the iPhone 7 is slow and bad,
though apple makes a stronger device but not stronger charger cable wire,
I was wondering why this channel has so many subscribers but then TWO PHONES Id follow you anywhere,
I recommend the Silicone case if u get a Jet Black iPhone,
power cables from Apple doesnt worth it,
I phone 7 support sony headphones,
matte black vs jet black PLZ HELP ME,
can i have ur other phone,
missing the the 55s design Mirrorlike apple logo with hint of glass back at the top and bottom and with glossy frame definitely was the best design looked very premium Now looking at 66s7 they look like some tv remotes,
beautiful Im talking about the video not the iphones,
I read about HISSGATE weird processor noise LTEgate constantly disconnecting from LTE 4G is this only to do with the intel equipped Iphone 7 or does it affect all of the iphone 7s Soundgate some problem with calls or the mic is it the same as hissgate or one in the same  RamGate or Memorygate issues affects 32GB option only it looks like apple used cheap memory which means very slow performance other issues include issues with Bluetooth which affects BMW cars not connecting or losing the connection scratchgate affects JetBlack iphone 7 apparently paint wears off very easily yet another disadvantage with buying iphone is its not compatible with 4G LTE band 66 meaning a percentage of iphones 7s wont be able to connect to band 66 which means you have maybe less coverage and you wont get the fastest speeds that tmobile or Verizon offer The price of iphone plus is just crazy high  why ,
I loved that Jet Black color,
I love my gold one  Ive had it about 3 weeks and I love it,
I got the gold 7 and its actually beish,
man that protective cover peel was sooo satisfying,
How is this phone only 69 times the price of a pencil Apple Pencil ,
Barely three instrument public,

JET BLACK FTW ,
Why does the IPhone 7 not The Plus seem so tiny ive Seen It In Person And Its Just Like the iPhone 6 idk why its seems so small,
Not only they took away the headphone Jack they never gave us a full Apple they keep taking a bite,

That plastic removal part SATISFACTORY GUARANTEED,
How is he so good at holding the phone still,
Apple not making anymore jet black colorways ,
Glassy iPhone remember me of my iPhone 4s,
Love the sound of that peeling plastic,
Why am i not impressedMaybe coz i have S7 Edge,
how much is the iPhone 7 Plus,
Jet Black I have seen many 100 bucks phone with similar looks,
I farted in a Apple Store and they got pissed its not my fault they dont have Windows,
you are the best indeed you are on top of this game,
So apple gets rid of the headphone jack to put in a taptic engine to make us feel like were clicking on a virtual home button,
Meanwhile I still have the 4,
i have the iphone 7 too,
*Great Unboxing*,
when you said hey siri at 300 both my iPad and iPhone respond and it got me confused for a second lol,
Finally A real unboxing so sick of all these fake phones that people claim are actually the real iPhone 7,
Hey bro can you pass me the dongle,
so if no Botton is needed that means next iPhone Will have small chin,
FULL REVIEW OF THE IPHONE 7 PLUS,
Ive got an iPhone 5S and im going to buy the 7 Plus but I dont want to continue with the black model should I choose the Silver or the Gold one,
Your boredom for this phone shows right through in the video,
B Ben,
Report some iPhone users have started seeing pixels lately,
I cant watch porn in the 7 ,
I think that the jet black should come with a pair of gloves,
Notification Squaaaaad,
Were the review at,
I stil want to thank my brother to by me a iphone 7 thank bro,
Im live in phillipine part of luzon cavite,
veryyyyyy nice video please make more videos,
YESTERDAY I FOUND AN IPHONE 7 if you see the owner tell him i need NEED the charger and headphones THANKS,
NO AUDIO JACK  ITS LIKE REMOVING IPOD FROM APPLE  VERY GOOD TIM COOK,
You sound like jerry rig everything,
Do you do giveaways on youtube,
ALMOST 10M,
Can you open the iphone with the home button or do you need to use the power button because the home button is not a button anymore,
Oh I still remember those old Facebook memes about how the iPhone 10 is gonna look Really really long ,
I think the reason people like iphone is and this is from an android fan because 1 the software is not as glitchy cleaner and much more optimizedspeed 2The Apple ecosystem works very wellair pods iPad mac books etc 3 Its much more simple and predictable Now I know the new iPhones are not that innovative and way too expensive but for someone who always uses apple I can understand why they like the iPhone,
Whats next Iphone XD Plz kill me,
I actually like this Ive never owned an iPhone so thiss gonna be my first,
the girl with the unreleased iphone x video linked your video for some reason couldnt comment on it but congratz to her for getting her dad FIRED FROM APPLE,
Dont you dare call it the iPhone X a minute later So to go home on the iPhone X lol,
lol im thinking to buy 8 but after watching this video i go for X instead im saving my money for X amazing,
I want some honey BBQ chicken strips,
Get pixel 2,
Just wait for DROPPING IPHONE XD OFF OF 100 FT BUILDING YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT,
Who was that awesome guy that kept getting in your shot,
anyone who is watching on iphone 5s,
You can hold the power button down to trigger Siri how do you turn your phone off tho,
I love iPhone x but i cant buy it Its out off my rang I am A fan of iPhone just fan I never buy it,
In Brazil in The most of d time we say iPhone X Not Ten X,
but but I like having money,
Unrealistic price point Definitely not worth the price I opted for 8plus,
White would probably show less fingerprints,
*ARE YOU LEFT HANDEDinsert random relatives here IS LEFT HANDED TOOOMGOMG OK GMGKOFMGMMGKFJSJYESYAYY*,
Anyone come here from the 1 trending video,
That moment when iPhone 88 plus get old during presentation,
Imagine the next phones iphoneXs andXs Max What about Xr,
Dont you dare call it an iPhone X Calls it iPhone x,
The face ID is not original samsung has that,
Apple has just that clean look while Samsung has THAT camera tho,
John Cena wont be able to unlock the iPhone X,
still dont understand why mobile devices have to be so bigthought thats what tablets were for,
So basically when swiping down in the middle you actually mush all those bacterias from the fingers onto the earpiece and vice versa for the ear onto the fingers Great job,
For a 1000 this phone better take me on vacation when I put it on airplane mode,
first Microsoft now Apple whats with skipping 9 lately,
Now my twin will be able to unlock my iPhone AWESOME,
Watching on 12 September 2018 ,
Watching on iPhone 6,
You can make an take phone calls on your series 1 Apple Watch,
My dad plays ultimate frisbee with him,
time to buy iphone 3,
iPhone X looks really gr8 Is there any update on iPhone SE Lookin forward for enhanced iPhone SE,
Gestures reminds me of my Blackberry Z10,
lol Brooke disabled comments on all of her videos,
He didnt hear They didnt skip the 9 7 8 9 I had to make this joke it felt right,
Home Button Function is just like BlackBerry OS10  Well its Pretty Cooool,
The screen resolution looks amazing but that notch is really bugging me Sure its a new design but id rather have a screen thats is more symmetrical,
Dont call it iPhone X look at the TITLE BOY,
it makes me cringe looking at the top porting of the screen so asymmetrical grrr love your accent dude,
Apple firing loving fathers since 2017,
Although people are saying that they skipped iPhone 9 I think their original plan was to call it IPhone IX but having 2 Is would seem redundant So I guess its Phone IX hmm Btw IX is 9 in Roman numerals,
Congrats on getting your father fired,
Ive been with them since the 2nd iphone but I gotta say Im not sold on this at all If it wasnt for all my group chats and friendly old ios I think id jump ship,
I guess the whole 7 8 9 thing wasnt just a joke,
2 min silence for those who will sell their kidneys for this phone,
Dont you dare call it iPhone X *Calls it iPhone X*,
Time to reminisce on the fact that the more they removed from iPhone the higher the price,
Hurrr Im really starting to like the Silver Reminds me of the classic iPod,
Dont you dare call it the iPhone X its iPhone 10 * says iPhone X 20 seconds later *,
Ik have a problem Now I have a Nexus 6p but it has battery problems So I need a new phone but which one should I buy iPhone X Pixel 2 Or wait for the Samsung S9,
where is i phone x dude you said hands on dont lie,
With Iphone X you definitely get the Top Notch Experience,
The problem with face ID is that someone could take ur phone and put it in front of ur face And BOOM they opened ur phone,
But the price point though Here in Europe it costs 1149 or 1319 Which translates in even more  just insane,
Guys tell me should I give this to my sister because I will get the note 8 please reply,
Hey marques im ur overseas fan I had a request to u for making a review video on moto g5s plus as this phone is making a lot of buzz all around,
411 is that like that wall street journal lady,
That top cutout makes it look like a taser with two prongs or a horned devil,
Gonna take FOREVER to get used to,
The gag isiphone 8 and X chip clocks 35 faster than note 8 haters,
722 Living the Dongle Life on the Left,
Fill the entire display around the notch Its really cool  Are you being serious,
There is no 9 because 7 ate 9 Okay Ill go now,
My country the iphone X is SG1600 A price of a gaming PC,
if you wouldnt add virtual notches to a regular screen then why the f would you make them physical,
Will you please confirm this if Im sleeping and my wife hold the phone to my face will it unlock Or if someone take the phone of me and hold to my face again will it unlock ,
The iPhone X looks stunning and beautiful Apple is making a great job The price is okay too,
How do you screen shot now,
iP display 47 hight 673 mm and 55 791mm iP *X* displaay 58 hight 709 mm Wat that look like im afraid of it so smaller than iP 678 plus lol,
*15 years later it gets slow ugly and oldfashioned* _And it has an expiration date_,
I like how all these android users r criticizing the iPhone Xif u dont like Apple then why watch a video based on an Apple product,
Ill wait for the future X versions when they come down to a more reasonable price around 699,
Sold my two kidneys for the previous iPhones Now if I sell my soul Id only be able to get an iPhone x charger,
Men your videos are dope,
*here after IPHONE XS LAUNCH*,
Can you unlock it with the picture of someone,
He says dont you dare call it the iPhone X and then he calls it the iPhone X,
A waste of 1820 if you are in Australia Not worth it at all This phone is not a good upgrade people should vote with their wallets and not buy this compromise in design Force them to bring back useful features that actually work like headphone jacks and fingerprint readers,
nothing impressive unless not on islave point of view,
The jailbreaking community will work wonders with the X,
woah guys I just found that the Sharp S2 looks exactly like the iPhone X ,
Can you access the notification center from where the time is displayed,
Rip Temple run,
Swipe up from the bottom for a function is a feature I missed from the Amazon phone,
Hey men which color the best of the two iphone x I am not convinced white with those edges,
If long pressing power triggers Siri How do you switch off or restart the phone,
Best Hands on iPhone X video Watched it multiple times Preordered Silver 256GB,
Thats blackberry 10 gestures swipe up and swipe down side scroll  Miss the true innovations ,
8 plus is my favorite thank you for this,
This phone has already been compromised on several occasions Really sad for the price tag,
Great Much explained Please make a video soon about how face thing work on iphone x,
Id rather buy winrar,
Best iPhoneX hands on video out there Good job sir,
He should make this track his official intro track,
117 Tokyo Sandblaster,
Hahaha that notch Full screen HD video with a massive chunk bitten out of the side holy shit Apple drones actually defend this Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave,
This phone looks so beautiful I cant wait to buy it,
quality of the video footage is amazing just as the rest of the review ,
Incase youre wondering what did the fox say dying,
I wonder if it ever will hit fluid 60fps in the gui The iPhone Plus Models have always problems with stuttering,
The phone have a bit too much issues like how the design is very unrefined large camera bumps the notch in the middle and how the side bezels look kinda cheaply done Not having touchid is just too much of a pain people will still get used to it but it will be a pain and overall more time consuming in the long run i made video of the how faceid stacks up against touchid after using other face unlocks for a while i just couldnt find it comfortable moreover apples approach is even more annoying lol,
The deadpan reactionshot right after the guy making a lion face was hilarious,
what about the famous screen crack so when it cracks and cant recognize the swip commands,
Apple still the best phone company for me I cannot wait for this phone,
Blackberry gestures well done apple hahaha,
Where I live this cost about 150000 because I live in Jamaica,
Haha Apple is pulling a Microsoft Windows on the naming scheme,
Why are the videos so pixelated and staticlike,
when you minimize the screen while watching videos to avoid the notch will that new screens dimensions be smaller or equal to that of the iPhone plus ,
What about if someone just wants to look at the lock screen time without actually unlocking the phone,
Since I couldnt comment on her video feel free to tell her my dad is better than her dad ,
Going to be a big problem for John Cena,
Yes I am really feeling the X,
Swipe up BlackBerry10 gesture,
What did the fox say,
Isnt that home gesture from Blackberry Passport,
So they have just copied the iPhone 7 and put a glass back on it and called it the iPhone 8 The iPhone X is cool but the price is not,
Preordered my iPhone X at 9 am the morning after the preorder opened and FedEx tracking says it will be shipped tomorrow Didnt see that coming,
What does the fox say,
status bar dont go white or black automatically override var preferredStatusBarStyle UIStatusBarStyle  return lightContent  is needed ,
I liked the fox joke and actually laughed,
So Apple is bad as counting as Microsoft,
iPhone X cost 1800 in singapore Not surprised at all,
Look at the notch wow mind BLOWN AWAY,
looks like a galaxy in the front,
Windows skipped 9 first thats so 2016,
wich camera recording this video,
How do you shutdown the iPhone 10,
This is great phone But i buy note 8 this is great phone i love note 8,
Who all is watching this video on your iPhone,
*o n e t h o u s a n d d o l l a r s*,
I like the iphone x screen but not the face id Hopefully it still got the pin as default but better if touch id was an option Planning to get this soon,
I think Pixel 2 XL is gonna be better Do you,
The iphone X is the best phone if you never use landscape,
Tbh im excited to see what app developers do with the new face id gonna be some cool ass apps pretty soon,
So if this is the iPhone X The abbreviation of it can be called iX Roman numeral IX  9 iPhone 9ish,
im french i dont understand everytime what you are saying but  1sub i like you,
For how long can Blackberrys be woken upgo to home with a swipe up lol,
Im watching this on my S8 and Im not buying iPhone X,
fresh like mada faka,
Not sure if i should buy the iPhone X or keep my organs,
My phone from 2016 has 13 megapixel cameras and image stabilization so apple is a bit behind,
What did the fox say Unsubbed,
I really hope really really hope APPLE GETS ITS KODAK MOMENT,
its iPhone 10 dont you dare call it iPhone x calls it iphone x,
how do you take a screenshot on that iPhone,
64Gb will be enough for iphone x ,
Animogis Wowthe furries gonna have fun with this one,
Impressive but not practical,
Guess what thats the great thing about capitalism you dont want the product no ones forcing you to buy it just go to a Best Buy and get an Android,
iPhone Xpensive,
Soyoure paying 1000 for gestures and emojis LOL,
As far as video in landscape will the zoom cut off content,
Got a note 8 ad,
7S for sure Well said,
While you guys here are arguing in the comment section Im here wondering how will John Cena unlock his iPhone X,
Will the battery percentage be able to be displayed up top It looks way too tight up there __,
Wow talking emojis how have I been living without,
Iphone jack hello,
i love the justifications the isheep use  Marques bro get serious,
You guna have to keep your eyes closed if your iPhone X gets stolen or if your BfGF wants your phone password  RIP touch ID youll be missed like Headphone Jack,
dude I a into the iPhone 10 I love the screen but I prefer the back design of the iPhone 6 it nice but the whata heck it awesome,
When you realize that you cant even afford iPhone 4,
Pokemon Go players will be forever accidentally closing the app _,
i think they skipped iphone 9 just because of resemblance of Windows 10  you know  they went from Windows 8 to Windows 10 D,
Everyone here is fighting over Apple vs Android while Im here on a computer,
Still a Samsung fan But the ipX did take a good step indeed,
Beast,
It starts from 1240 in Greece the base model,
Iphone x is my dinner for today,
Dual camera Wireless charging OLED screen Hey Apple Welcome to 2012,
Apple How can we try to be innovative Employee Lets copy The S8 remove some things people like from it and make some subtle changes Apple Your promoted,
Wait but how would you turn off the phone completely because you have to press and hold the off button for Siri,
That NOTCH is really off putting,
slightly updated describes apple best,
*It will be awkward when Apple release the iPhone 9  11 next September*,
everyones sarcastic comments isnt enoughbecause Mrx will be the most demanded smartphone in this universe till next years product so work hard and be ready to sell your balls with kidneys girls I am not talking about you you should decide what to sell with kidneys,
Cant stand the gap in the screen just like the Essential and Sharp phones,
TheY shouldve made the apple at the back glow Just sayin,
That top notch is really bugging me,
Apple made iPhone 8  8 plus obsolete in 10 minutes,
watching this on a Samsung s8,
Thanks I really enjoy your videos I do have a question about iPhone X oops I meant 10 In previous phone if you are on a 3rd or 4th card you could hit the home button to return to your main home page card When you were using the phone did you find a way to quickly return to your home page Or do you just have to swipe back to get to it,
Beast,
This phone costs the same as a decent gaming pc Let that sink in for a moment,
no promotion display not a big deal i beg to differ its a must on phones people dont know what they are missing,
these new gestures are pretty confusing One of the best thing I like about iPhone is how intuitive the interface is from day1,
Whats the point of wireless charging if it still needs a wired dock station  Dumb Fucks Tech makes you dumb The top bar is clumsy with watching movies or videos,
its nice and all but its also 1000 not worth it,
The screen of the X model reminds me of my laptop screen i put duct tape on my camera and Apple ships a similar design out of the box,
This is best detailed review i have seen so far Thank u for the video,
So the X is the 15th iPhone But the ten year anniversary Iphone Roman numeral X,
I dont really like the app logos on the new iOS version when u compare it with the 933 version,
Swipe up to go home hey kind of reminds me of what blackberry tried to do when they had theyre own OS,
Iphone x launched but when you will change your channel name from mkbhd to mkb4k,
Great phone I think as Apple have definitely tried to create something new,
How do you turn off the phone though,
quick question how do you take screenshots since the home button is gone i know that assistive touch can be used but its not that practicaljust wondering,
Time to buy Samsung galaxy S6,
I can go on trip to the USA buy the iPhone 10 and still spend less than buying it in the UK,
Watching This On My Note 8 But Still Gone Cop The iPhone X just for the hell of out lol,
Im definitley getting it I probably would not be if the money I have saved was actually money I got from work instead of my dad tho lol I am tentitively planning on staying up for the pre order and getting an unlocked Silver X 64gb on ATT for now I just wish the X release wasnt going to be so limited and hard to get potentially from what Ive heard and I wish I could get the new gold color with the X This was the most easy to remember guide to how the new gestures on the X are used and how the phone differs from the 8 and 8 plus Thank you,
I didnt expect that fox Joke,
Bro how do you take a screenshot,
Swiping up means people are going to be super liking a bunch more on tinder lol,
Will face regn works in extreme low light,
U missed the 25 percent louder stereo speakers,
Theres no 9 because 7 ate 9,
Its called iPhone X bc its the ten year anniversary my guy there will be an iPhone 9,
This is so hard when you watch P,
That black part on the screen really looks funny but since the market leader wants it that way so no choice,
The notch looks so dumb when watching videos etc Being able to see an uncluttered screen is really important,
watching this on my iPhone 9,
You forgot to review headphone jack,
I WANT IT GIVE ME IT,
The iPhone now has Novalaucher,
whats the intro bgm,
Dont you dare call it iPhone X a few moments later So to go home on the iPhone X,
i liked the dude moment,
I want the iphone 10 that looks amaxing and so simple Ive never had an iphone but thatll be so fun,
The notch at the top really bugs me,
Cant wait until its finally released counting till November 3rd,
You you dare say iPhone XSo to go home on the iPhone X Nice lol,
Gotta say iPhone X is top notch,
12mp camera seriosly my Xperia XZ has 23 LOL and it was 350 cheaper LOL,
Hmm with that kind of pricingthey should give something free like coming with it Earpodsidk how to spell it or something else,
wait how do you restart the phone by pressing and holding the power button siri comes on,
Can twins unlock the same iphone,
That black bar at the top screen of the iPhone x cough cough I mean 10 is cringe af,
Why camera did you use during the video,
Probably use this one soon LoLs,
Nine is an unlucky number in Japan because it sounds like the Japanese word for Torture,
Finally i will be able to buy iPhone SE,
inventing an iPhone X iPhone 10 just makes the 8 sound old and rubbish even though all iphones are a ripoff,
I want iPhone X but my bank balance doesnt allow me,
rip secret auto father author bias ski kid recipient arise,
Wait if holding down the power button triggers Siri how do you turn off the phone,
In the eyes of a future thief Hey theres a brand new 1500 iPhone X in that mans back pocket All I have to do is quickly grab it out show it to the guys face and sprint away with the unlocked phone,
lol who would call it iPhone 10 I know its a roman numeral but you dont see people calling wolverine weapon 10 people call him weapon X,
jesus your video is clear,
Remember when your iPhone 44s back glass broke Apple remembers,
Will battery percentage fit up in that top bar,
I cant wait to see TechRax to smash this iPhone,
Am I the only one that knows that the Blackberry Z30 2012 had full screen no notch and gestures to get in and out of apps,
why does 480p look like 1080p on ur videos,
Im still on a 4S and its holding up fine but I think Im gonna get the X now,
This is why after my iPhone 6 Im switching to Samsung Apple hasnt brought anything worthwhile to the table in two models and now the phone with the biggest change to it hardly even a big change no buttons and facial recognition software thats been out for a while now and theyre asking for 1000 for it Ill be suckered no more,
Will the iphone X camera be always on even though when its locked since it needs to use face id,
guess Ill just use me 1000 on a house payment for a month or two lol,
Dont know it is my ocd or something  that black bar at the top really bothers me  LG v30 nailed it this year with the front design,
WOW,
This is just way too expensive for a phone in my opinion Sad thing is 99 percent of Apple users wouldnt even use half of these so called features listed in the video,
When will iPhone X Plus be released That might be worth the ,
I get to preorder 4 hours before the actual preorder date,
how can u switch it off,
Sci fi device,
Now that Apple collected all of our fingerprints it was the right time to start collecting our FaceIDs too I cant wait to donate one of my kidneys to buy the brand new gen IPhone that I can unlock with a drop of my blood Safe like1 in 7 billions,
Sowhen the galaxy s9 coming out,
Does iPhone X have Taptic Engine,
Wireless charging on Iphone 8 Yeaaaaahhh Samsung did that 2 years ago on the s6 LOL,
Que da hora esse iPhone aqui brasil,
The real question is can you still screenshot,
Where is the simplicity that once apple have is gone,
No headphone jack no home button next iPhone could be no speaker,
The charger is too big I like a regular USB type wall charger,
I hope you can adjust the gestures the swiping from top right corner would suck cause Im left handed,
back at it again with the original intro tune,
What if it hangs or something and gesture wont respond for home xD,
i dont want to give apple my face Neither do I want the CIA getting it,
Finally they copied every features from the Blackberry z10 and his BB OS,
If I grow a beard or change my hairstyle am I just locked out of my phone,
So apple has wireless charging now like after 5 years wow thats some revolution,
you lost me when you started talking about how to go home on it,
lol only apply would release the next iphone iphone 8 and make it immediately outdated with the iphone X This is so apple,
I phone 10 10 Werent they pretty adamant about it being an X Like the letter X,
Howd you have the 4K Apple TV on the bed behind you Am I missing something,
Apple already has a great place to place a fingerprint scanner the apple logo on the back Dont know why they had to remove it,
Great face id now my twin brother can open my phone,
Wireless charging My Nexus 5 had it in 2013 Way to go apple,
Think the vertical rather than horizontal camera bump will make it rock even more on a table since the lowest bump point is closer to the bottom,
I prefer the essential finger print ID,
The notch ruins the entire aesthetics of this phone,
Nothing about its resolution HDR,
Anyone else see the apple 4k TV in the background Review maybe,
To be honest Not as spectacular as Samsung s8 and Xiaomi Mi Mix not exciting phone not an android fan here,
Ive been an avid iphone user since the 3gs and now stopped at the 6 Since they removed the analog headphone jack I have got to say sayonara to iPhone Thanks for your service over the years steve jobs did the best with design and now the new design heads have no idea what to do I think Ill go for the new Pixel 2 or something Peace,
Appleo no baby what is you doing,
ceemeagain,
hii just wonder if iphone x has also taptic engine,
Do you think Apple Pay will work without having to press the side button on iPhone X as previous models Apple Pay shows up as it detects the card reader,
Pure BB10,
The 9 is in the price three times 999 it totally wasnt skipped Lol,
5g support,
What would I phone x be if Steve jobs were alive ,
Lemme borrow it for like 2 seconds,
The phone that started it all,
Im probably in the minority here but Id gladly lose the front camera in exchange for a full screen edge to edge,
6GB of ram HELL YEAH ID ROCK THAT,
I feel like Apple is gonna rip this off lol,
6GRAM 256GB with that design and selling at 500 dollars  That moment you realized that how apple google samsung have been stealing our money ,
I just came back to see what started it all,
this is changing the world about people thinking about Chinese products,
The perfect phone and why is it so cheap oh my god I need one,
Holy shit 256 gb storage Im replying with my 16 gb iPhone,
My iPhone looks like it belongs to eighties Era in comparison,
This phone has more ram than my PC sob2x,
Marquesiphone7iphone,
Just make a 552 version and Im jumping on the bandwagaon,
Plus he forgot to mention this phone is scratch resistance the thing is crazy takes a hard material like a sapphire to scratch it since is hard glass,
Remember when this got him excited,
Apple engineers have used specific parts on iphone 5s66s that are manufactured by xiaomi companyXiaomi offers very reliable productsI have a red mi note 3 pro and it is awesomeNever lagsbattery lasts very long even on heavy usage,
RIP APPLE 19762016,
I want this so badly I was sad to hear its China only,
and sheeps be likeonly Apple does innovation,
Sexy phone,
2016 OMG A BEZEL LESS PHONE 2018 WTF A BEZELED PHONE IM NOT BUYING IT,
If this was an iPhone it would retail for at least 1500,
The slipperiest phone is no doubt the Galaxy J7 Pro,
You see that samsung fanboys Not the s8 was the first bezelless smartphone,
This thing is legit more powerful than my pc Id say the phone is worth every penny good job China,
I dont know why the Samsung Galaxy S8 is getting so much attention for doing something that this Xiaomi phone already did 2 years ago,
wow ultrasound sensor frame vibrating speakers this is a damn impressive piece of tech,
6gb of ram 256gb of storage bezel less nd 500 Wow,
Can someone explain why everyone says 4400mah instead of 44Ah,
All I want is that Wallpaper in 0146 MKHB Where can I get that,
My new phone will be this bye iPhone welcome Android,
man xiaomi has got some talented employees So much innovation by a budget phone company,
Unbelievable quality of the video MKBHD is a truly professional,
mkbhd please do a review of the MI MIX,
Its designed and made in ChinaI think that I wont pay for iPhone 8 next time I used previous other model from XiaomiThat company really pay lots of attention on design user interface its MiUI is extremely useful clean and beautiful And Xiaomi Company also design and sell drones surge protector Smart IPCamerayou can communicate with your camera by voice etc AppleIm kinda disappointed honestly,
This is amazing I havent been so excited about phones since I first got a smartphone A whole new beautiful design with top specs,
hey Google you checking this outwith your Pixel and its huge annoying chin ,
mad respect for xiaomi bringing the bezeless  rounded corners god damn 25 years ago thats innovation,
This xiaomi mi mix gives me continuous orgasm just looking at it No gonna lie,
what is the sound quality like for phone calls,
Would love this phone Love this company,
Ok that was impressive It has better specs than any other phone and its sexy Only 500 Wow,
Holy shit the Chinese actually made something instead of just shamelessly copying Good job xiaomi And BTW its not pronounced shoomi its pronounced siaomi,
2019 Thats a lot of chin,
Ive waited so long for a phone to replace my Nexus 6,
Mkhhd the ceramic is really durable I doubt it will scratch or crack,
OK how on earth with all these incredible specs and still the price is 500 gg Google Pixel and iPhone,
watching this from Another blockbuster from Xiaomi The Redmi note 3 pro,
Its 1000 in Canada RIP me XD,
kinda reminding me of the sharp aquos crystal,
this is more powerful than my everyday laptop shut up and take my money,
Literally the best looking phone I have ever seen,
That looks beautiful I really hope it gets released in the US,
Technology is growing fast,
I know Im definitely late to the party But I ended up buying one of these Its such a BEAUTIFUL phone The camera isnt amazing but it takes good photos in good lighting This phone is innovation The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is rumored to be dropping soon And if that phone comes out with a snapdragon 835 6gb ram 2k display updated camera and software It will be the best phone on the market Period Im using this phone over my Samsung Galaxy S8 right now They are two different worlds of phones But having innovation over typical phones people have these days is better to me in my own opinion Ive already had comments on this phone and they are just blown away It kind of sucks the U S only sees Apple and Samsung because thats all thats really hardcore promoted around here China needs to bring more phones over to the US If any of you have questions about this phone just let me know Im a daily user of it and I am more than willing to answer some questions for you,
IMO this one looks better than the new Mi Mix 2,
Well xiaomi is very popular and reputed in Asia,
500 BUCKS its dope,
In India You Get 2GB Ram 16 GB rom 5 screen snapdragon 425 in 98 Better Than anyyy samsung Phone within same RangeDope,
OMG this is exactly what is needed from phones It seems ridiculous that televisions can go almost completely bezelless on something as big as a 5070 screen and be thinner than a phone yet cell phones today keep following the same formula I wish I could go out and pick one of these up right now Im in the market for a new phone and this could definitely be my daily driver,
Looking back at this This phone had literally zero competition,
Mi MIX 2 would have 99 screen to body ratio,
s8 vs LG g6 vs mi mix ,
If it only had an IR blaster I would buy it now Looking to replace my S5,
Aw naw Marques I need a full review That specs and screen is baller Give me a review,
me mix or meme ix,
can someone give me a link to that same exact wallpaper ,
Damn Id definitely use it with a launcher though,
Haha its funny to watch this in 2017,
wish it was 500 ,
plz everyone just once hold this phone on your hands u will probably never think about iPhone,
Company you never heard of,
Like always high quality videos at beast resolution I like how you review phones combining them with other gadgets around them nice takes Keep up bro,
Please do a full review,
OMG I JUST REALISED Wheres the front camera,
I cant wait until the chin is GONE Bezel less is the future,
256gigs for 500 OMG,
When you see a phone like this it makes you wonder what Apple engineers and designers have been doing these years Eating glue,
aahlove that classy intro song,
Beautiful,

I had the aqous but now I have the iPhone 7 helava jump in phones,
The most liked video of mkhbd Xiaomi Mix,

MKBHD is so slick he got the phone delivered to him before CNET got to even see it,
fan of xiaomi,
You know thats a more immersive experience Real life Get off your devices,
Pixel Launcher   RIP NEXUS,

Looks like an absolute muscular phone power packed specs looks too good  bezelless will be the NEW norm starting 2017,
I keep coming back to watch this phone *sigh* they should have named it Xiaomi Mona Lisa its beautiful,
roughly 500 I guess this video shot the demand for the phone skyhigh cause I cannot find it anywhere for less than 750,
I have this phone and its amazing,
I love the video and your personality makes it what it is KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR doing,
Awesome phone great review I also like the quality of your videos,
256GB of storage Hold up WHAT,

This was a great design They messed up with the mi mix 2,
Looks dope,
DOOGEEMIX Price is 4GB64GB 16999 6GB64GB 17999 Unbelievable,
When Chinese phones stop copying iPhones and actually breeds innovation China is the new world,
Love the display,

Sharp Aquos Crystal anyone,
Great review I just bought one from CHINA getting it in on the 13th love this phone I was one of those phones are so boring people thankful for this piece of art,
Bezelless phone with bezels WOW INNOVATION,
Yes I would rock that sick dope What I say,
and Im imagining the same phone with a curved display right now A curved screened bezzeless phone P,
Ive been buying Xiaomi phones for the last 3 years Theyre truly great and affordable phones D,
Xiaomi bringing a new era of smartphone,
Pixel Xl blue would really be great But in general any phone would be good It would give a bit if shine to my bad year Thanks before hand zaza_matias77,
What a cinematography it was just awesome too good,
China is a magic country it is changing from copying to creating,
i am just waiting to buy this phone just saving for this awesome peice of future,
well covered MKBHD I think your videos are very well done and entertaining Keep up the good work,
You need to get your hands on a Sharp Aquos Crystal Xx,
Watching this on my mi mix Best fone Ive had in my life Although mine has a loose back panel in the right hand portion so becareful if you buy it make sure you check that the back dosnt creek when you apply pressure Im returning it for another so hopefully its not an issue with all of the phones If it is its a deal breaker for me as the back will most likely pop out after using it for a while,
Suddenly the iPhones and Pixels of the world look so oldfashioned I will get this just for the sake of it,
yes bro please keep reviewing some great chinese phones because not all chinese phones are bad gotta love your crispy high quality video D,
its a bigger and better version of the OnePlus 3T for only 70 more,
damn it has DAC also,
WOWOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWOWOW,
beast phone but my problem is this dude is not available in my country dfuq only samsung and ppap crap,
Downsize mix to 55 inch with same CPU RAM but 128Gb memory and 3000 mah will sell like hot cakes ,
I really enjoy ur videos ur going into details and ur videos are high quality thank you for the effort you put in youe videos love it,
dont worry Nokia in 2017 will blow all of those phones out of the water,
Brave attempt by both the companies Piezoelectric speaker something new to hear Background music and in between video edit of car is classy,
am I the only who was wowed by the 4400mAh battery life I always thought 3600mAh was huge enough but wow 4400mAhAMAZING,
A turn of events i phone 8 will copy xiaomi mi mix this time,
I love it Must buy for my next phone Im a big gamer so this screen is perfect  Thanx for the review Marques keep it up Y,
The phone looks amazing I hope bezelless phones are the future Great video by the way Love your channel Factual and straight forward,
wonder if its in the US now2018,
Could someone just tell in China bring this phone here in USA because everybody definitely want this and I do too,
Excellent quality video production as always love the focus pulling,
one thing I love from this phone is its battery in normal usage I can get 8 hours of SOT in light usage 10 hours can be achieved,
Dope phone Dope Marques Great specs on this one and I love the price Do you like the camera on this one As always you Rock,
this phone and Nokia will destroy 2017 dont mess with Chinese they got technology like crazy lol we in 2017 Chinese are in 2030,
And I thought my Note 7 was gorgeous and Im was loving my V20 Until now,
When do you think it will receive the Android 70 Nougat update,
Ordered mine from China yesterday and scheduled for delivery Monday with DHL Express only 30 for shipping Cant wait What will I do with my jet black iPhone 7,
You can get curved corners with an app Its what I have on my One Plus 2,
If only you could use this phone on project fi,
This is my next phone,
This video is soo crispy I love it And with this quality the Mi mix looks even better,
Finally a Xiomi smartphone I requested for Xiomi brand reviews for years Im glad you finally recognize this brand,
Still the best looking phone E V E R,
i dont know how many times have i watched this videoi am happy to get this beast,
This is what I was expecting from the Note 7 Thanks for bringing this to market Xiaomi,
When are US phone companies gonna start innovating,
next year Im upgrading from my OnePlus 3 and hoping to go to this,
if that think had a edge screen it would be Instabuy for me ,
Apple will steal this concept in the future then claim its their INNOVATION,
6GB of ram,
Danm Marques almost 4m subs the grind is realll ahaha Im proud of you brother keep doing the good work ,
    bilibili,
will this carry all the radios to work on SE ATT Cricket or TMobile in the USA,
What a rom is it running on yours,
OK if they sell this in Europe anytime soon Im going to buy it instantly,
I love how your videos looks smooth sharp and cool D,
Dang this beauty should be available for the US and Canadian market now Dang,
Is this an nonworking phone Can you say anything about the voice quality coming through the vibration,
just check on the Geekbench,
This is the Xiaomi Mi Mix The most stylish phone of 2016 Coming out in December D,
idea was stolen from Sharp They also made a S7 copy Even though goodlooking phone but useless in the netherlands due to different 4G LTE bands,
iphone,
love it wanna have one here in Kampala Uganda,
The problem is always the same Powered by Android,
mkbhd love the video you edit amazing the s8 and g6 are all because of this phone,
watching this on my mi mix its wonderful,
Woah he pronounced Xiaomi correctly respect,
Im in love with it already,
now xiaomi is generating a lot of momentumand it is going to get bigger,
When youre in a WiFi zone and youre watching Marcus Vids on 1080 and you forget to turn your data off and turn the WiFi on o,
can u use it with Tmobile,
So This is first phone that have an Rounded corner before Galaxy S9and LG or other phones that have now a Rounded corners,
meanwhile Apple is busy designing a different shades of black for the next iphone smh,
I was gonna get that phone but I noticed that the battery is non removable,
Next to that Youve got such a nice car there Mr MKBHD Xiaomi always does it with their price points unlike many who simply sell brand names and nothing more,
xiaomi Mi Mix would be awesome phone uulimaa,
Nice job bro  this is 1 of the best rewiews i ever seen  Good luck  Thanks for the videos ,
This is what you call innovation not removing the headphone jack,
i saw ittouch it last weekits really greatbig screen and beautiful,
OO Wow Just wow,
Got the 6GB Version and loving it ,
Ceramic drop n its will crack,
351 look at the time  ,
Great looking phone I bet that once you drop it on the ground with the screen facing down That phone screen will crack,
Bruh This shit is lit,
Why am I watching this for the 16 th time,
Hey marquees do you know where can i download a global rom for this mi mix I got the 256gb version All great so far,
Xiaomi made a revolution in smartphone history Respect,
My Xperia Z Ultra was 64 inch tho but bigger than this a lot Srsly,
Preform better than one plus 3 3T,
I think if they reduce the display size to about 5 they could make much more money out of this thing Looks amazing ,
Phones company from West  Boring Stable and *cough* Removing features East  Innovative Unstable but adding anti mainstream features,
The design is revolutionary but the specs are just as good if not better 4400 mAh battery Christ,
Such a cool phone This is what the industry needs,
can u put the link from where to buy the same hoodie you wearing I really liked it and would like to have one,
Truely genius from xiaomi,
this phone is the future and also your camera is killer loved it,
first wallpaper is QHD  link pls,
Shuld i change my s8 plus for mi mix XD,
Huawei One Plus ZTE and now Xiaomi Wow lets see what competition breeds This phone looks awesome,
Checks prices 1000 euro *cries in central European*,
Caught my eye right off the bat I will consider purchase for sure,
Just saying its not actually pronounced My UI its Mi UI like XiaoMi Mi UI Good video tho,
Hey mkbhd mi mix 2 has launched Waiting for your video,
For the same specs memory and battery life Apple would charge you some 2300 according to Gizmodo,
030 meme mx,
I love those epic shots taken of the phone nice work man,
Guys For all the question about the rightdown corner camera you can just rotate the phone 180 degrees Then the camera will adjust by itself It will be on the leftup corner,
You now what is up The sky Now this what my s voice app said,
But still no micro SD card slot They should of used one of the Sim card slot,
3100RMB,
I dont know if id be able to own something like this would be so paranoid of dropping it,
its allready sold out at 4th NOV,
screen is 644 inch but since its bezel less it looks smaller in size but not the screen cool looking phone,
gahh damn xiaomi makes me want android,
MKBHD call this innovation Beselless with headphone Jack Love your Way of describing the Technology,
Just when people actually thought Mi Mix created new tech but it actually only copied from Sharp Aquos Crystal Justiceforaquoscrystal,
Only 500 for those sick specs,
500 bucks  more like 1000 unfortunately,
the Phones in the future 2017,
If the LTE bands work here in the US I would most definitely rock this phone,
Where can i get these xiaomi phones Aliexpress Dhgate,
I would definitely rock this phone I love the way it looks and the specs are solid,
Oh my Lord,
This phone needs to be part of my body,
Xiaomi is the best phone manufacturer,
That phone has more RAM than my PC _,
man mr mobile ur great i like the graphics and the perfection you put into your videos,
How fast was the internet Is LTE B7 2620MHz enough,
Great video KPHDalways spot on with your videos without any buzzkeep up the great job,
Where can I purchase this phone ASAP and from a reputable vendor,
that thing is gorgeous the Chinese mobile market is growing so quickly,
looks nice yeah but if you put it in a case its going to look like any other phone the specs still are amazing though,
Sony needs to take note of how to build a bezel less phone,
Now here we are over a year later where just about all the major phone manufacturers have adopted a nearbezelless display Now the Mi Mix kinda just looksnormal Still its an amazing concept,
Man I love your channel you always trim the fat and give us the good stuff  one stop shop for reliable information in tasty 4K Awesome work,
The screen to body ratio is actually 836  still amazing tho,
i love how people go out of there way to find cool new tech and unique mobile devices that have less and less bezels love the reviews man  kepp doing what youre doing,
Id rock that Currently on a Huawei Honor 8 and these MIUIEMUI skins over Android are delightful to use Im sure its a great phone for daily use,
I would rather love a 60 inch screen with tiny top and bottom for many reasons a for all the stuff that needs to be there b to have symmetrical looks c to be able to hold from both ends and not having to touch the screen itself while gaming,
BTW its not Mix its actually Mi X,
Can You do a complete user review of phone,
Can you please send a link of the wallpaper of the guy climbing a fence i like that pic,
man when he was saying the specs my jaw dropped to the floor,
awesome video mankeep up the awesome workand by the way I cant wait to get my hands on this phone ,
I want that phone,
if it did had a edge display than this was the best smartphone of 2k16,
love this phonewhen everything else looks basically similarthis stands apart I want one,
I love Xiaomi I really wish theyd come to the US,
Phone with 4400 mAH Im totally getting,
Its actually 800 in the States so calm down lol,
Just got mi Mi Mix yesterday and man its beautiful After one night it performs beautifully so farI paid waaaaay too much for it but it was a XMas gift to myself,
Yes Yes I would rock this phone as a Daily  For sure Waiting,
Hell yes Id rock that Ive been dreaming of this phone since 2002 when I had a Samsung clam shell flip phone from Sprint,
Nice reviewI was waiting to see this mobile reviewed by youGreat video D,
Finally somebody has inovated huh,
i saw this at online store thinking its just another china phone then seeing the screen and the spec wow amazing id buy this,
This is definitely a good phone i can connect it to my car Auxin But it cant run iOS,
Why is the chinese building better phones than us,
Those specs are fantastic Id definitely buy that phone,
Would you mind reviewing Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X MKBHD,
My wallet cried when I saw this phones price ,
yes i would awesome stuff,
Why the hell would you buy the Pixel when you can get something like this for less,
Thanks manYour videos are always to the point,
Hi is the Mi Mix Qi capable Wireless charging,
Are you selling it If you are hit me up Definitely want to get one,
*looks at phone* Me  im sorry samsung,
Well done XiaomiTHIS is what you call Innovation in Designnot just making something Jet Black and calling it a day,
Here after the release of mi mix 3,
faste charge is notpicher,
The camera quality is great,
Oh  its not 500 the 128GB version is like 700  the 256GB version is about 900 to 1k X,
Dude why do you do this to me now I NEED this phone I always talk about how I need the bleeding edge of tech and now you bring me this I really really hope they bring it to the US,
500 for 6GB of RAM no bezel 256GB of storage and 4400MaH battery how does Xiaomi make money off this,
I fell in love when you said 64 inch display I wantnow,
whose here after watching sequel 2,
Hey have you done a review of the Mate 9 from Huawei that would be dope ,
Need this but 99 screen to body ratio place fingerprint on the back and Yeah you have smartphone which is look like a mirror,
Your best ever Intro,
I still want this Wish it was cheaper for how old it is but I mean I guess,
The comments created by paid ppl is just mind boggling,
This phone looks like from the serie Black Mirror love it,
But how is the battery life,
it looks like the future oohhh how right you were my friend too bad Essential had to come out with that stupid notch and ruin it all,
the mi mix is ahead of its time,
This device is gorgeous,
4400 battery 6gb ram 500 bugs _ Best Phone u cant get,
the funny thing is most of the people bashing this product will still end up buying it,
Am I the only one who loves the 7,
The jet black looks similar to the iPhone 3GS,
a lot of ear wax sharing action going on over thereyuck,
I have a Black Matte iPhone 7 and Im really happy with it I dont understand why this gets so much hate Thumbs up if you have an iPhone 7 or if you want one,
DONT WATCH JUST READ THIS ITS FASTER 1 not a new design at all just an oval camera and no headphones 2 woo more battery killing features now in home button 3 somethong androids had much longer 4 omg 2 cameras woo the only good thing about the iShit 5 so basically no screen improvement 6 stupid 7 no longer able to pass the aux cuz they want your money to be able to do that 8 gunna lose those airpods along with your paycheck 9 gotta catch up to android 10 better performance better battery Wonderful jokes by Apple,
Only apple can name a new color as innovation,
STEPHEN FRY TALKING TO JOHNNY IVES  008 ,
iPhone squad,
006 is that Jonathan Ive and Mr Steven fry,
When android phones have a camera bump its a design flaw But when IPhone does it its beautiful Lol,
Is anyone ok with out wireless charging I am ok with it,
When the iphone 6 was introduced i hated the stripes on the back but now that they are gone it feels like something is missing,
I was Excited for the iPhone 6plus when it came out and got one I am not excited at all for the iPhone 7 I used Bluetooth headphones years ago and honestly I prefer cables headphones any day Also I listen in my car with a charger GPS and audio cable aint got time to install a Bluetooth receiver just so I cant play wifi audio and charge battery too,
Wtf the zombie gunship app isnt that good on my phone what version is thay,
Im glad iPhone is now getting the 2014 upgrades Good for you,
They should make a iPhone 7o with oled display,
I got an Google ad before the video dafuq,
I wonder how Iphone 7 would looked like if Steve Job was alive,
i buy the iPhone 7plus jet black looks cool and the features is best,
Matte Black  Jet Black,
*S U P R E M E W H I T E*,
007 Jony Ive Why no mention of him Marques,
Yes Now i dont feel the slightest bit guilty switching to Android See ya Apple It was fun,
Can someone please tell me why they decided to put a new haptic feedback home button completely unnecessary btw and got rid of the headphone jack if they wanted to reclaim more SPACE IN THE CHASSIS,
The black iPhones are beautiful,
not sure if I should upgrade to the 7 right now just got the 6,
cant wait for the galaxy s8,
Marques you are the best tech reviewer man Your videos are really impressive with all major features covered,
Its been two years and I never lost my lightning to headphone adapter I did wear it out though and Apple had to replace it,
so apple uses the same design for 3 years and nobody bets an eye but if someone like htc use the same design everybody complains,
Man youre one of the most unbiased persons Ive seen making a video about tech 1 sub,
dude your shots are perfect Great job man,
009 Stephen Fry on the background,
160 For probably something youre gonna lose or 9  a cheap 2 Headphones,
Decision is made Ill go s7 edge,
As always theres a good balance of tech and personal in NKBHDs review,
wheres my free air freshener The ipharted 7 just stinks,
Was that Stephen Fry in the intro Broll background,
Wait Hold on hold on Was that Stephen Fry in the beginning,
440 MKBHD turned half white and half black,
When is NFC going to work with other cams other than apple pay,
man where is the iPhone 7 and 7 plus review waiting for it please make a video about it great videos love your videos,
I love this quality Crisper than lettuce,
10 new features you wont notice and one crucial feature removed,
Poor Apple theyve destroyed themselves again Tim Cooks greed and arrogance has corrupted this once great company Taking away the headphone jack because courage and then selling a 10 prosthetic to add back in the functionality words cannot describe how pathetic that is,
dude you are one of the best tech reviewers and an inspiration to us all keep it up and stay mobile my friend ,
229 it is rated to survive under 50 meters of water This is wrong This rating is for the Apple watch series 2 The iPhone 7 is rated at 1 meter for 30 minutes still neat though Nice video despite this little mistake ,
its iP67 which means 1m50 under water for 30 min not 50 meters under water thats the apple watch series 2,
What about the insane the specific absorption rate SAR amount  this thing is a microwave for your brain,
wow no audiojack and 160 for earbuds get ready guys The next innovation will beiphone 8 plus  iphone 8 cannot be charged with the electricity at ur home U need to buy apple icurrent generator And for iphone 9u cannot use ur own wifi U need to buy apple iwifi via itunes,
Is that Stephen Fry on the first scene in background,
I got that iPhone 7 Plus Black 128GB,
Woulda been perfect with that OLED All good cant wait for my 7Plus order to arrive,
New design if this is a new design thn am Steve Jobs,
sooooo if I want to charge my phone and listen to music via headphones at the same time fail,

Any spot Stephen Fry at the beginning,
WOW Stephen Fry is in the background  Right after the intro when Marques shows the closeup of the iPhone,
new features that we dont know number 1  design,
160 DOLLARS FOR THOSE 2 INCH AIR PODS REALLY REALLY ARE YOU KIDDING ME ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY YOU LOSE THEM AND YOU ARE FUCKED good job apple still the most overpriced company out there,

*Definitely NOT 50m of water resistance 1m for 30 mins,
that awkward moment when apples new iPhone is already slaughtered by the 6 month old s7 edge,
Stephen Fry at the start of the vid woot,

Wut game was he playing It was like a gun ship game,
Thank you so much for making a simple video,
Iphone 6 design stolen from HTC M7 Iphone 7 front facing speakers stolen from HTC devices No click home button stolen from HTC,

Grateful comments and insightful upgrade knowledge,

Marques great tip love the new design by Apple The Twelve South and Lumiy designs are sleek and amazing like Apple,
Apple still pushing out sub 720p 2012 resolution phones in 2016 lol,
awaiting your full review of 7 7Plus Soon,
Funny thing tho I probably havent bought any of the products youve reviewed but I like listening to you whatacreep,

Why is Rose from movie Titanic sad Because there is no JACK in iPhone 7,

Great and informative video as usual One quick question regarding the Airpodswere they being passed around So the same Airpods and being inserted into multiple ears Ewww,
am waiting for Sony Xperia Z6 ,
putting OLED screen on iphone more expensive iphone i guess ips is cheaper than OLED  some ppl says that,
No thanks Ill stick with my gorgeous black Note 7 Apples got nothing on this phone Lmao,
On 652  whats the name of the game,
Was that Stephen Fry and Jony Ive at the beginning,
why is the video style so similar to Jonathan Morrisons video 10 things  10 thingsand then the visual style,
Stephen Fry casually in this video at 007,
Are you mad that the Space Grey color option is gone,
in theory allegedly ugh,
Hey Marques one question did apple removed the sapphire display and it from home button in the new sevens,
The best recap and first impression video to date,
IS THAT STEPHEN FRY AT THE BEGINNING IN THE BACKGROUND,
Was that Stephen Fry at the beginning,
nothing is impressedrather wait for Google Pixel phone,
m a Hugh Fan from India m a tech news editor and used to update news related new gadgets  guess whos the inspiration yeah MKBHD,
Ive always loved his intro song its sooo sickkkk,
All I want is my Galaxy s6 with ios,
Was that Johnny Ives in the background at the first of the video,
Hey Marques iPhone 7plus for me ,
NAME OF THE INTRO MUSIC PLS,
thank you very knowledgeable,
Warer resistance 1meter up to 30 mins Not 50m That was the Apple Watch 2,
Or should I buy the 6s Because I only use iOS sorry,
Idk if its me or if you say youre gonna review a phone and then dont or I cant find them in your mis of videos lol,
I wish they would make a good display,
And speaking about the thing youre gonna lose,
Nr11 Iphone 7 mit dem YinYang Display,
legitimate review unlike those jokers at cnet,
Definitely sticking with my 6s until the 8 drops,
Ill shame on myself if I call this a new design,
John Ives talking to Stephen Fry in the back No big deal,
The Android butt hurt is strong in these parts lol Its a phone  no need to explode with angerjealousyresentment etc If youre phone works for you  go for it Enjoy Cheers,
The game at 645 is the sequel to Zombie Gunship called Zombie Gunship Inc It hasnt come out yet but it will be out in winter,
Yeah cant wait to upgrade to the 6s from my 5s ,
Its not 50 meters its rated at ip67 which is 1 meter The Apple Watch series 2 is 50 meter rating,
great video no interest in upgrade my 6s still enjoy charging while listening,
towards secondary forest oral,
The best YouTuber everMKBHD,
MKBHD what is the game you play at 646,
AUX jacks are perfection Theres a reason something remains a standard for decades,
Marques the iPhone does NOT have water resistance to 50m Thats the Apple Watch 50m is over 150ft there isnt a phone that can go that deep and survive to show you the video  The iPhone has IP67 which gives you 1m up to 30 minutes Thats about 150 of what you said so do correct the video with an overlay so people wont sue you,
I have got 2 iPhone 7 1 is rose gold 128 gb and 2 is gold 128 gb thanks,
So is no one going to point out how much apple blatantly copies HTC on all their phones Unibody HTC did it first Dual speakers HTC did it first Dual cameras HTC did it first And the touch home button,
Next Year Samsung gets rid of headphone jack,
Hmmm speakers on the bottom and in the earpiece sounds familiar Where have I seen this before Oh wait yes lol thats right The HTC 10 Haha I recall not long ago the nonsense of people claiming that HTC was copying Iphone when they released the HTC A9 because yes it did look like a Iphone But realistically the overall design originated from earlier HTC phones Seems to me it is Iphone who is getting their great innovative ideas from HTC The BIGGEST underrated phone of all times in my opinion is the HTC 10 The price was not an easy one to digest when you had such great competitor phones available at a cheaper margin but over all in my opinion the HTC 10 is the best ALL ROUND phone on the market to date,
I believe the S8 is also taking out the Jack,
I dont think the jet black will b much issue especially if Its gon be in case the whole time anyway I cant wait to get my hands on one,
u r the best utuber ever dude,
that new glossy one looks like the 3g YIKEs,
160 for something that may or may not fit in your ears Every decent earphones you buy will have changeable thingy things to more perfectly fit into your ear,
If you loose the air pods that 160 GONE,
When you consider switching to iPhone after seeing a blurred out Asian girl in a video about iPhones you know the Yellow Fever is out of control,
I believe you inadvertently confused the underwater depth of the iphone 7 with the new iWatch On your video you stated that the iphone 7 is rated for 50 meters If I not mistaken the iphone 7 is 1meter and the iWatch is 50 meters Thanks for the great videos T,
so if its the same thickness as the iphone6 why did they remove the headphone jack,
Could you tell me what model of your camera filming this video please I love the resolution and high quality of it,
One Simple Question 1 why dont ios have a file manager so that we can download the stuff and open it in any app we want,
MKBHD Now featuring Stephen Fry 007,
Stephen Fry and Johnny Ive in the background,
I feel like recently all the apple panels have been quite underwhelming and it seems like they parody themselves when they do what we all expect over hype mediocre features and update their phones to features that have been industry standard or just barely raising the bar,
innovative,
innovative,
congrats for the vid,
marques just a thought I think you should redesign your topic animation In my opinion that purpleishblue and not so clean line animations dont suit you and your channel just not that crispy nevertheless my favourite youtuber and channel  beautiful design good day,
when everyone is ripping on Apple for coming out with 160 ear buds when Samsung has theirs priced at 200,
Bro I am from India I need yu to show Turing smartphone reviews,
just save your sanity and money and purchase a OnePlus 3,
Solid sound track intro,
Can it really shoot RAW images That would be awesome,
Pretty sure Jet Black is just the black paint left over from 3G,
Stephen Fry in the background,
it cannot go to 50 meters dont do thatthis is ip 67 the apple watch series 2 does that,
When will be the Lg V20 first Impressions video,
black,
Hey At least it doesnt explode,
Already confirmed iPhone 8 will have OLED screen,
As soon as I start the video MKBHD videos I like them so I dont forget Plus they look good on my liked videos list,
Thanks Marques This really helped,
606 Anybody notice that smidget of earwax on the left bud lol,
Hey at least its not a bomb D,
Wait was that Stephen Fry at the blurred out start of the video,
Bring Elon Musk as Apple Chief You can see Apple exploration to Heavento bring Steve Jobs BackPeriodPeace,
Was that Stephen Fry in the first few seconds blurred out,
whats the name of game before gunship,
I love all these Android fanboys in the comments xD,
646 what game is that,
Ill stick with my HTC A9,
So i cant plug it into an aux cord or use any other type of headphones then apple,
Im gonna go with Note 7 even tho Note 7s battery fued up Im still gonna be its buddy,
Damn apple back at it again with the no innovation,
Anyone knows what game he was playing at 644 ,
Wait for the iPhone 14 Itll change everything,
The iPhone 7plus looks so small in marques hands,
New design Where  Its almost identical ,
wooow thats what a call NEW DESIGN change some wires in the back add a different texture of a color and there you have a NEW DESIGN xD you guys are running out of ideas huh who cares people still buy it conformism at its best,
intro song,
Steven Fry in the beginning,
Do a giveaway of it when it officially launches PSSelect me,
And here I am still rockin an iPhone 4 ,
231 you can shower with it as he said  ,
Protip AirEarpods dont fit andor are prohibitively uncomfortable to 70 of human individual people Wont make a difference though of course,
Is the iPhone 7 screen and or home button made of sapphire crystal or at least a fusion And which should I get 7 or 7 plus Im using iPhone 6 right now and I watch a lot of media like movies and videos,
This cell phone is a trash is only brand v,
So iPhone users cant use wired headphones and charge at the same time,
Great review bud great shooting Well done,
Engineers just found out that headphone jack is puncturing the battery on the Note 7 lol,
OLED probably will never happen Apple might adapt new display technologymicroled,
Should I thumbs up for MKBHD or thumbs down for iphone7 lol I dunno just gonna leave it like that,
Best phone  At least its not a boomb phone like samshitt  Apple  samboomb,
i like the intro song man hhh,
Yep Ill be waiting for the new Galaxy My first phone that wont be Apple,
Ive got the iPhone 6s Plus and I dont find anything to buy 7  Apple  with the 8 something more,
those airpods better play music from God himself if Im gonna buy them,
was that Stephen Fry in the background in the beginning,
The rating is IP67 This means that it is Protected against the effect of immersion between 15cm and 1m Not 50m,
Rip dongle 20162018,
im watching this because i like to know my enemy ,
I dont get why everyones always on the Apple hate train They removed the headphone jack and are giving you the adapter Big deal Apple did it with the floppy disk everyone bitched but they followed Apple did it again with the removal of DVD drives in laptops everyone bitched but now look at every laptop out there Weve used this analog jack FOR OVER 100 YEARS and Samsung would definitely never take that first step towards moving to digital audio Apple is a company that stands for diversity in engineering women LGBTQ asians etc for privacy even fought the govt and has BY FAR the best environmental standards in tech nearly 100 renewable energy and 99 of recycled non harmful material used for packaging Also they have the best productservice ecosystem instant updates best customer service and product reliability blazing performance and the list goes on All these android fanboys are so deluded thinking that this product just randomly became the best selling product in history as if it were an accident And as for the innovation although Apple may not have been the first to things they definitely got their implementation nailed Look how Google ditched Wallet and released Android Pay soon after Apple Pay released with the same implementation how all phones got fingerprint sensors after iPhone implemented it correctly how Android Auto came out after CarPlay etc etc etc Google and Apple are both incredibly successful and innovative but I just dont understand all this blind Apple hate when theyre actually doing some incredible work,
dude just wanted to say the quality of your camera is awesome,
Just spotted Stephen Fry,
This is probably the best iPhone yet sarcasm,
Just Stephen Fry and Eddie Cue in the background at 011,
644 what game is it,
Was it Stephen Fry talking to Johnny Ive in the opening blurred shot,
whens the note 7 full review coming,
Marques hasnt covered the V20 yet interesting,
Under 1 meter of WATER NOT 50 METERS,
Can I use AirPods with Macbook,
but you forget top 11 3D Touch,
iam need gift,
lmao is that stephen fry in the background of the first shot,
WTF 160 What do they do They can fly,
Air pods,
Speaking of things were gonna lose love it,
I found the Jet Black to be very grippy compared to the other models,
Minor and slight changes to the phone coming up from the 6s Definitely not sold on this one,
Anyone else think 650 is still to much for a phone in 2016,
nice videobtw what name of the game 638,
most beautiful mobile and impressive and also performance is awesome,
the Galaxy Note 4 best phone ever,
Number one new design and booom you lost one from watching this video,
Got 7 but exactly a year later since it was launched  Phew finally,
which games were you playing near the end of the video It looked like a mission of call of duty ac 130 gunship XD,
patiently waiting for his official review,
11 Same cracks,
160 wireless earpods are a joke Now I understand why they wanted to remove the headphone jack The profit margin must be huge,
amazing phone 3 I have Iphone 7 plus I not have airpad headphones,
what I would like to see is an iPhone with double SIM,
Stephen fry at the star of the video Blurry but its clearly him,
dude was that stephen fry i had to do a double take he looks just like him if that isnt him,
All these Android people are hurt because a lot of society has moved to well rounded phone ecosystem iPhone and they are clinging on to modsadvanced features etc Its like Mac vs PC all over again,
 I,
someone should make a phone with a solar system so the phone can be recharged through a car drive or whatsoever without needing a power bank or a cable i actually like the new features idk why people hate it so much idgi  especially the new camera thats dope,
are u going to do a detailed review of Iphone 7 and 7 plus it has been a while since theyve been out on a separate note keep up the great work u r doing brother,
Jet black 7plus 128gb all day,
The only reason I would ever consider getting the iPhone 7 is because it comes in jet and matte black In other words Fuuuuck thaaaaat,
i will just like your videos without even watching them lol cause i know u are good,
Cant complain if Tmobile is giving it away for free,
who is actually going to get this I will aventualy but not on launch Im getting it next summer it will be then cheaper,
who is actually going to get this I will aventualy but not on launch Im getting it next summer it will be then cheaper,
50m good job on reading the wrong brochure,
well I guess Im going for Moto Z,
Hey Marqueseagerly waiting for the full review of the Iphone 7 plus When is it coming,
Does the Oneplus 3 have more ram than this So its better at gaming,
IS THAT STEPHEN FRY AT THE BEGINNING,
Man I swear this is what the 6s should have been,
Is that Stephen Fry at the start,
wait the iPhone 7s plus,
So basically your telling me The iphone 7 costs what almost 780 for basically a Minor upgrade in a camera When I can literally just go to a pc gaming website and buy something for the same price and play Better games and do way much more including that Thanks but no thanks Im sticking to my Nokia 3300,
IM STICKING TO ANDROID,
Hi i am from iceland and i am going to london  can i buy iphone 7plus in london and use him with my carrier in iceland ,
So excited for the iCamera7,
Yeah that Matte Black for sure,
Back To The Future 2016 flying boards and cars Real 2016 removing headphone jack which is world news,
Coz of this video I changed my mind to buy zBlack to Matt Black,
New design Hahahahaha Im laughing until i stop watching ths video,
the 7plus so clean i need it in any color,
im gonna wait for the 8,
damn 720p IPS in 2016 where is the courage in that,
lol huawei p9 is perfect choice not this one,
Was that Stephen Fry at the beginning,
For 160 you could buy wireless beats,
EXCUSE ME what was that song in the beginning,
229 Its not rated to be 50 meters under just 1 meter 50 meters was for the new apple watch,
I like the upgrades on the the jet black foams,
Anyone in 2018 and wait for the X plus to come out,
thanks for mentioning for the last part about the OLED display as I am about to fall for this iPhone for the first time as an all time Android user I am not impressed with the Snapdragon 820 it feels like it is just a fix for the 810,
Introducing Samsung Galaxy S8 with no headphone jack and the new 2 cameras with new rose gold color,
wow so the new iPhone is still garbage only ips 67 water resistance still no wireless charging still no oled and how is it that Apple can still get away with a 720p screen on a 600 phone when everyone else has been rocking 1440p for several years The iPhone 7 is truly just made for idiots who buy anything shiny made by Apple,
50m depth Apple clearly said it is IP67,
Nice ehehe very informative,
WOAH TECHNOLOGY,
if you need a background music for commentary tech talk video what do you guys recommend,
Whats good is paying 650 for a 720p display in 2016,
Pretty much the same phone from last year basically Except minus features A button that doesnt click Thats insane,
Not 50 meters 1 meter water resistant big difference,
What was that second game you were playing,
If the next iPhone 7s doesnt have a higher res screen then I dont think I will be getting it,
iPhone 7 sales are gonna explode Kinda like the Note 7,
anyone else notice Stephen Fry in the opening seconds of the video,
Full review when Been 3 and a half months,
which one does come first Gear iconX or Airpods ,
Nice so now its going to feel like my home button is jammed Fantastisch,
everyone complaining about the headphone jack when android will be doing this probably by next year or year after and theyll comment this is such a great thing,
am I the only one who saw Stephen Fry in the intro,
This 7 n 7  vary bad cant hiding notification  every body can read ur SMS screen ,
I preordered the 7 in black yasss hype,
This is the best thing ever,
cant wait for Samsung to come back spitting fyahhh,
Does anyone know what were the two games played by Marques in this video,
Lmao Human Subjects,
s7 edge is the best,
love your intro,
so basically its an ip6 without a headphone jackwhat a surprise,
Top headphones update soon,
50 Meters of water lmao,
Picking up the 7 this October hopefully,
This is the first Android phone that has me questioning my loyalty to Apple,
Finally the S8 is coming out and the S7 will be cheaper so I can finally sell my s6 and get the s5,
So how do we remap the Bixby button into a PornHub shortcut,
What do you call a group of security guards in front of a Samsung store Guardians of the Galaxy,
This guy could tell me a brick is the new thing to have and Id purchase it,
Ive been on team apple my whole life But im afraid apple let me down when it comes to the yearly upgrades there is basically no difference between the 6s and 7 But look at the difference between the s7 and the s8 Sorry apple but I think its time that I move on to team android,
Cant wait watching porn on this Infinity display,
Im regretting that i recently upgraded the iPhone 7 plus,
One year later we have almost completely bezeless phones,
I remember when people didnt have to bring up a headphone jack as a feature,
why would you want the back button on the left its further from your thumb,
Today i just bought my first Samsung Phone the s8 and ive never saw that much details in a video its crazy,
Im an iOS fan but the screen on the Samsung is no joke deadass,
I wish in the USA Samsung sold a factory unlocked version I do not spend full price on a phone full of carrier bloat,
Im actually watching this through the s8,
Actually the back button SHOULD be on the right side If you look at the s7 its also on the right side,
Wow the aspect ratio of Samsung Galaxy S8 is so insane and the pressure sensitive home button,
Imo I think the ultimate phone would be google pixel stock android software inside a samsung hardware,
When you know you cant afford this but still watch it because of entertainment,
buying iPhone is totally pointless now after this gorgeous device  ex apple fan talking   ,
When you really think about it its so strange to call them phones or smartphones Lets face it these devices are really pocket computerswith a phone function They need to come up with a name other than phone or smartphone Thats getting old ,
Daaaamm this video is at 46M as of April 5th at night,
Is LG G6 a good alternative  Its 300 dollar cheaper than S8 in my country,
I have not watched any other videos I was waiting for MKBHDs,
A major negative is they didnt address battery life issue Im going to wait for a few weeks until real users tell us how the battery handles the larger screen before I do anything,
Did anyone else see that this video made it onto a Samsung commercial,
the new system ui is great and that bixy sounds great,
Imagine running Lineage ROM on this device,
God this phone is beautiful,
Is the memory card slot hybrid with second sim option ,
Im going with the Galaxy S8 as soon as it comes out,
Ive been watching these kinds of videos from the first day i saw this phone today i went to the store and i finally got to the phone in my hands It felt really good,
Whos watching this with a samsung galaxy s8,
s8 is reveal but i dont even have j1 oh my god cant afford,
Been watching your videos since 2013 moto G review and theyre really good and helpful Keep up with good work and stay mobile my friend Peace,
Good so I choose mi mix,
Still has a headphone jack D,
I will buy this when s9 comes out,
Ive seen alot of Apple users switch to android rather than visa Versa,
Im watching this video using my galaxy s8 is amazing,
Thats a really analytical review Really helpful man Exactly what i expect from mkb keep doing the good thing,
When it comes to Tech Videos and More specifically reviews my first way to go is your channel MKBHD keep up the good work,
Happy to see you reviewing this you do a great job looking to replace my LGG4,
Your videos are great one of the best Ive learned a lot about tech from you channel Samsung should add usability of that S8 g S8s edge screens ,
Lets take a second to appreciate the 8K crispyness off that RED Weapon Eg 414,
The display is stunning on this phone,
I cant wait to watch porn on this bad boy,
Galaxy s8 is the best phone 2017,
Watching this exactly one year after it came out on my s8,
the official All Time Greatest Tech Reviewer on the Planet Hands Down,
Hey Marques Its been 2 years after the release of this phone Let me have it,
Comment section summary 2 praise for Samsung 98 trash talk about Applefans Cant people just enjoy without hating,
Dude your videos are some of my favorite to watch you have great knowledge on all the products that you review really enjoy your Tesla videos Keep it up man,
Great review and more importantly  completely honest BTW I love your shots you make simple objects and regular spaces look beautiful,
I currently own a S7 right now What are the key features and differences between the S7 and S8 Will this phone even be worth upgrading to,
At last a beautiful samsung phone,
dude the back button has always been on the right,
That display is awesome but Im with the majority iPhone 7plus all day  Good video as always though,
Im very concerned about that battery size compared with these big screens,
I love your style of video and the cinematography is next level Keep it up,
When you are holding an I phone 7 and he says It Still has a headphone jack,
Marcus the voice here is a little reedy Maybe drink warm water before a video to relax the vocal cords Otherwise great video Keep up the great work,
Nathi saaro Samsungyo rocks,
can u do an unboxing and review of the galaxy a3 2017,
Nice camera coverage Infinti display looks good Phone looks cool and in your hands even s8 looks like s8  Thanks for shows the video option,
Now I can buy Galaxy S7,
Im using the s8 in rose pink and the battery lasts me longer than the iphone 6s plus at the end of the day the minimum battery percentage would be 15 but on my iphone i need to charge it around 8pm every night i dont know if the battery lasts longer because the phone is new or what but i love s8 more than the iphone ,
Can you compare between Qualcomm MSM8998 Snapdragon 835  US model and Exynos 8895 Octa  EMEA in geekbench or some other app and show the results Im curious about capabilities and superiority of both the processors,
or maybe you was trying to Say BOMB ASS Android LOLO,
I think the fingerprint reader is just fine for me Coz im left handed D,
Okay Im an iPhone guy but I gotta say that display looks *SEXY*,
It is definitely a bomb phone in the good way,
Vproof 5000mAh battery case 35,
great review as always Your videos are always very well done and great that its uploaded in 4K,
DUDEthe back button return is always on the right,
Hey Marquees Brownleeloved you videoloved your cinematography skills,
without sacrificing any functionality oh brother those curves make using the phone considerably more difficult accidental edge touches hinder functionality big time,
So shit this isapple is really really lucky to have a rival like samsung,
Keep up the great work man Been watching your content for a while now and its amazing Keep improving and hope everythings alright,
Oooo cant wait to xvideos this phone Lolol ,
I love the video and your review of the phone was very helpful I also really liked the cinematography of the s8 as Ive never been able to get the hang of doing that,
HeyGood work fam I like your cinematography,
Great video as always Marques your focus on producing reallooking videos without all the fancy background lighting that most youtubers do is personally my style You probably wont end up reading this comment but MrMobile and your channel are my 2 favorite YouTube channels to date,
Galaxy s8  The new Mkbhd of the mobile world Welcome back Samsung Awesome cinematography mkb love your videos,
Donald Trumps fingers wont be able to reach finger print scanner,
I really like the way you edit your videos Also the quality is amazing as well Keep them coming,
Love ur vids mate the focus is on point Ps the phone is sick,
Thanks for all the great videos Its nice to be able to have a great source for subjective tech reviews Keep up the great work,

Apple Introducing wireless charging,

Amazing video gear mkbhd just love your crisp vids its like so realistic and great job keeping it unbiased galaxynote7 flashbang  hope this one doesnt start blowing up *fingers crossed*,
Im watching from the S10 and I can say from 2019 that the S8 looks old compared to the newer devices definitely not a 2020 design,
MKBHD is last to the S8 party but first with the best quality,
Dude just seen you on the Samsung commercial Dope,
Enjoyed your review Covered most aspects of the Galaxy s8 that a user may need to know,
Just watched the video in 4K and it was amazing,
S9  the screen wraps around the back,
People love to fight Soon there will be apple vs Samsung civil wars,
Great video Love the way you explain every aspect and the pros and cons,
Really love this unbiased review on the S8 I currently have the S7 and am definitely considering upgrading after seeing this Keep up the good work MKBHD love it ,
this guy can definitely get anyone to buy anything literally ANYTHING,
Why the hthey put that button bigspy on the right of the phone its just to manny buttons now and dont look kinda normal i wont even use that,
only negative thing I have to say about this phone is the placement of the fingerprint reader seriously wtf might as well not have one 6p definitely has the perfect placement,
I love the way you make smartphone specs talk I love the New Samsung UI looks clean and less bloated OMG the S8 design is breathtaking Keeping the Jack is impressive,
Now Thats a review like A real review not apple sponsored review like lew did,
1st most beautiful phone of Ive ever seen 2d is The Mi Mix a beauty,
Nice review Love watching your videos You and michael fisher are the best,
I love how he wasnt rushing to be first and decided totake the timeto upload an informative video,
the battery is cr** I finally have 4100mAh That should be standard in 17,
Hey Marques Brownlee will you be switching to s8 ,
I definitely enjoy watching your videos straight to the point Keep them coming Oh i wish you do a feature video with Michael fisher mrmobile,

Hey your reviews and impressions videos are the AWESOME You treat every thing that you review with an open mind,

Nice review Unbiased well studied and superb video resolution One of the best tech reviewer More power and continue to be an unbiased reviewer THUMBS UP,
hay dude just want to let you know I live your channel been a sucriber for almost 2 years anyways love the s8 cant wait to get this phone anyways keep up the good work will be watching lol,

SMASHED THAT 100K MILESTONE Ever done that before,
Still has a headphone jack **laughing** D A M N A P P L E *update* I bought the SE,
Great editing skills and I strongly agree with your s8 impressions especially the not so good fingerprint scanner placement though I want to have my hands on this beast Keep up the good work mkbhd,
Dude you are an awesome reviewer and present it like a pro You should be on TV selling stuff,
Dear Marques please do a video review in the near future comparing Xiaomi Mi 6 and Galaxy S8 explaining why the latter cost twice as much,
Can you make an s8 vs g6 comparison video comparing specs feel and experience Thanks ,
As long as this phone doesnt explode I think Samsung will be okay Ive only had an iPhone and looking at this it makes my iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB seem so outdated When is Apple going to do things like USBC micro SDXC support bezelless display etc Apple charges a lot for the iPhone but its competition like Samsung has a more feature rich phone,
i was waiting for your review best looking phone ever,
Dude Time to switch from apple to ,
Should I be worried about the rebootingrestarting issue they are talking about  I am about to make the switch from iPhone 6s to this beautiful S8,
beware samsung fanboys ahead continue on ur own risk,
DAMN you made Caseys review look so amateur,
What the HELL have I been missing I havent even heard about this channel until now Subbed danngg,
No words just Brilliant phone,
I just got mine today  gonna rid of my s7 edge in a bit haha,
Can you please do a video on the best smartphones with removable batteries,
This phone felt amazing in the hand 62inch was more comfortable than my 55inch iPhone 7 Plus,
That last bit made me laugh for a good 2 minutes Amazing video man,
I love the stability in your cinematography and the way you keep your audience engaged,
Great review as always Probably not enough new features to upgrade from the S8 though at least for me,
This is the best tech review channel I dont think anyone matches the quality I think Ill stick with my S7 for now though,
I hope you can remap the button under the volume rocker,
mkbhd I am from Bangladesh and I love your videosfor in depth reviewI wish if I can make some videos like youur the best  pray for ur success always,
I get it today the s8,
Thanks for this vid Marcus Im an IPhone user but to be honest before I delve to deep into Apples ecosystem I kind of wanted to try Samsung to see if the grass really is greener on the other side the top tier water resistance and the beautiful screen really make me want to switch to it Keep up the super high quality videos,
Can you make a comparison video of LG G6 and Galaxy S8 need your reviews regarding both,
Who else miss his old intro and that music tune,
Samsung Galaxy S8 so beautiful phone,
Back button on all the S series and note series were on the right so this is correctbut anyways you have the option to change the positions in settings ,
MARQUES PLEASE DO A SONY XPERIA XZ PREMIUM HANDS ON,
Thank you You always give a full review and cover the device from top to bottom,
This phone is going to be the Bomb But hopefully not That kind of bomb,
can you give us moto 360 2 gen reviews and functions,
Thanks so much for your views on this phone Im definitely going to get one,
mkbhd i Love your videos each time I get a notification I know Im about to watch a masterpiece,
Looks nice but 850 no thank you These insane prices do not match an increase in technology,
This is what I call a good use of space,
Ive had my 6s for the longest time and well Ive jailbroken with it and Ive always kinda wanted a android Im getting it in June,
dude u r awesome  i mean ur way of delivering the important aspects of the gadgets is way much easier to understand just love every video of urs ,
Hey great vid The way you explain each and every detail is just flawless its not that easy as it seems,
Thanks Marques for such a detailed impression That phone is just too good,
That fingerprint reader will leave plenty of fingerprint on the nearby camera lens too,
Amazing Video still one of the best tech reviewer,
coolest budget phone atm except 11,
i would never by a big screen phone without Reachability,
Mkbhd has been my favorite tech channel in YouTube Quality crispy video and no bias Even better than the verge,
before you insult this phone apple fanboys it has headphone Jack,
Love the review gotta say youre really convincing me to switch from iPhone to Samsung Awesome editing too,
SXSW gaming awards 2017 Sunday December 31st,
Broll shots are amazing,
I must have massive hands because I comfortably use the fingerprint scanner,
damn near broke my screen I tapped this notification so hard,
Thats a honest impression Thanks MKBHD,
I always like the way you explain tech and always here because of the quality content,
Your reviews are really great Thank you so much Keep up the great work ,
best man best and complete review  y the video style  speed and clear voice are awesome,
watching porn on this phone will be great,
Great video mate I love the fact that your opinions are open youre not one side to iPhone or Android or MicrosoftApple Cant believe how far your videos have come Marques I used to watch you when you first started and to see the improvements that have been made to your channel is just phenomenal keep up the awesome work mate,
Man i really appreciate the chinomatography that you do  Every reveiw that you do is so crisp and sharp I admire you and your work ,
Great First Look as usual Marques  Still Touch Wiz and the lack of frequent updates gives the Edge again to Apple ,
113 iphone looks 100years older comparing to the s8,
love the vid very unbiased pointing out the good as well as the not so good I agree the fingerprint sensor is in a weird spot keep them coming,
Can u make a video if s pen from note series do work with s8,
Right in the video about HTC 10 you complained that the 3000 battery is not enough here youre saying its great Kind of biased,
ok lets wait until 2020 so we can see how smartphones look like je nice prediction bro,
I can see people making the camera blurry by missing the fingerprint reader,
you are doing bestkeep it going,
Great job in reviewing the phone Its gorgeous phone,
still has a headphone jack lmao,
Damn I miss my headphone jack,
Luckily Im left handed so I wont have that much of a problem on the fingerprint scanner D,
Badass Phone by Samsung with an amazing Glass n Metal Fusion Body With all sorts of ammunition under the hood Lets See how much this Bixby satisfies the Users,
S8 is so beautiful in the video,
Thats nothing my HTC one max has a 59 screen one inch bigger than the galaxy s8,
mine crackedfell the moment I opened the box disappointed,
still enjoying with s6 ,
YOU ARE THE BEST IN SMART PHONE REVIEW GOOD JOB,
Who else is watching on s8,
your review helps a lot to choose a one from manyU keep on reviewing ,
Thanks for this now I know what to get,
752 other areas where theyre not pushing forward too hard the battery we all witnessed what happened when they tried last time,
they said the phone can turn on by just looking at your face can you find out if this means the camera is always on,
A beauty So is your work,
Nice review man nice audio quality by the way,
watching it on Samsung Galaxy S2,
I see Apple got you under their power you had to go an bite the forbidden fruit,
Im just waiting for battery BOOOOOM,
galaxy s8 vs galaxy mega 63,
Loled at the bomb joke XD,
IF APPLE doesnt do anything ground breaking this year with the iPhone 8iPhone Edition I gotta say Apples going down By the way Im a huge Apple fan its kind of annoying their slow progress,
Nice Cinematography Brother I love Samsung S8 as much as i love to watch your videosKeep UpPeace ,
Your vid definitely inspired my unboxing video too dude Why didnt you stick with the S8 Seems like a viable long term solution to me,
maybe I have big hands but the reach was fine no trouble for me to use the finger reader I also loved the UI display design,
hey can you do a honor 8 and Huawei p10 reviews,
Meanwhile Apple is busy painting phones red,
Hey im a fan Could you do a Bixby review,
Amazing video MarquesBrownlee Very precise very detailed and very systematically put Thanks a ton  cheers ,
Can you please do more of xperia reviews Thanks,
Beautiful screen I would like to know the speaker sound,
it is surprising to me that not many people know that this is a new processor and probably consumes less power Samsung knows what they are doing they know that this phone is critical samsung didnt reduce the size of the battery capacity entirely because of the note 7 what happened with the note 7 was manufacturing problems with the battery etc samsung even changed the chemicals used in the battery so it has a longer lifespan optimization can give a battery with not that giant capacity the ability to last for the same amount of time and the same amount of time over usage samsung obviously thought of this they wont pull an Apple on us that would be suicide,
dont forget to talk about how the phone is defaulted at 1080 out of the box when you do your review could you review it with giving battery performance at 1080 and 2k,
Great prereview Looking forward to more in depth review later,
galaxy core prime lte to this,
I got a knew s8,
Is nobody mentioning this THE CAMERA BUMP IS *FLUSHHHHH*,
Theres people crying for the S8 and G6 and Im here in love with the Nexus 6p I think Google should make a phone with the build of 6p with the specs like the S8 and also water resistant That would be so awesome,
you are a great youtuber I love your content  You are also gives your perspective on a phone Just keep doing the great work,
Such a good first look at the phone thank you,
love the life like feel of your videos really helped me choose the galaxy s8 from a myriad of different smartphone,
This thing made every other phone look ugly to me,
Can the display be switched to 169 for that ultimate movie going experience I also heard the video cam was capable of some serious slomo frame rates Review should show that right,
This phone is definitely gonna be one of the best of 2017 Awesome vid as always But man crazy tp see how far you have come haha I have been watching for about 3 to 4 years now sophomore year of highschool always come back Just your character and detail keeps it amazing Im sure that you could sell me an orange as a tech gadget,
But every time when you go for finger print sensor unintentionally you will leave a spot on glass,
its quite hard to usd tve ksyboard on this phone kind of miss applr intustive design,
im watchin this on the s7,
Dedicated personal assistant button Noticeable functionality push with hardware Now its up to dev team to keep up with growth,
i love your videosi have been following you since yearsyou are an inspiration for many even meexplaining everything about techhats off to you mkbhd,
Watching this video on my S8 lol This phone is perfect I also use Xeoma app on it so its really good,
soooo high development while iPhone struggling with home button hahaha,
Thisll be my first Samsung phone been an iPhone user since the 3GS ,
do u think CEO of SNAPCHAT had said right about INDIA,
OMG I GOT THE S8 PLUS FOR 4300,
MKBHD which one would you buy S8 or S8,
Dope video Marques Great meeting you today,
He says This is everything you need to know about this new phone at 027 133 You said S8 edges here feels much softer  they are much more seamless feeling Thats what Samsung calls Infinity Display aka where it ends and where the edge begin is blended Not the size or shape of the Display is called Infinity Display,
2020 design They literally just made the screen longer Nothing new,
Great video Another great phone reviewer is  myproject13 Check them out,
its nicebut my reaction was so bigger when i saw iphone7,
So that finger print scanner is like a finger print magnet for the camera lens,
yo what is that wallpaper that you have on the iphone at the 114 mark love it,
Watching on an S8 Plus,
I would buy this phone if it wasnt priced like a mid range laptop,
Nothing to convince me to change my NEXUS 6P yet,
surprised you find the software button design to be ugly i think it looks futuristic but hey I am sitting in broad daylight watching the vid through my iPhone screensooo might appear different in real life,
Careful it might blow up and rip your hand off,
Nice Tech review as always,
Look forward to finding out if the camera suffers from the same horrid oversharpening that the S7 has As much as I really like the S7 I found that my old Nexus 5X took better pictures than my Exynos S7,
Loved the Sockeye jersey Do you play ultimate,
Headphone jack super tall display usb SD card reader but will the others inside Starbucks be jelly of my phone if it doesnt have an apple logo on it,
I love this guys reviews Never bias to any device I have bought a few good stuff of his review,
*Samsung* Galaxy J2 where my samsung army at yo,
what camera lens microphone setup did you use for this video,
Back button should always be right,
wait what no no not this guy again,
The camera sensor is updated its not the samejust a small update but still a update,
Just saw your commercial,
Great video I really love the way you commentate on your videos,
sir I am your biggest fan,
Hes complaining too much for me,
I was wondering why just 4gb of ram when they could have up the specs of ram to 6gb,
I pre ordered mine today and it comes with a free VR headset Im excited Upgrading from Note 4 which is still good and still has a higher resolution than the latest iPhone This s8 is definitely revolutionary,
Looks great I hope they add another speaker for stereo in future models I have an S7 and will be upgrading my phone in around 5 years That would be around the S12 time Wonder how things are different then,
Hey man I just picked up the cor aural blue 58 S8 at best buy brand new for only 300 I want the 64 S10 plus in that flamingo color but not sure I want to spend the money Would you reccomend that I get the S8 plus or S9 plus as my larger device Never had the S9 before but this is my second time with the 58 S8 but first time rocking the coral blue which I must say is dope I like keeping two phones one large one smaller one hander Which do you think I should get as my larger device and it doesnt have to be Samsung Thanks if this message finds you Kashton,
I hear the Bixby button cannot be remapped,
still you have a question its never enough dude,
The finger print reader ensures that you smudge your camera ens every time you try to unlock your phone,
April 21st I will be getting it,
Ive never once had a problem reaching the pulse reader so why would anyone have a problem racing the fingerprint reader lol youre good at finding something to say though,
hey marquees where can I get that skin you used on the phone,
Which experience is better LG G6 or SGS8,
just wait until september when apple invents wireless charging and curved displays,
Is it me or are these phones too long I will stick to my S7 Perfectly designed phone,
Hey Marquesa very good review you have given and Ill have to admit thats a sexy display right there I liked your style specially the word Bomb new Flagship conclusion Peace,
Bixby review please Thank you,
You didnt even mention the Exynos processor,
3500mAh is a pretty decent battery and Im still sitting here with my 1800 battery,
Bixby Why not Sammy Lol And about that battery statement I was thinking since its a OLED the pixels actually turn off when parts of the screen are black so does that save battery life Just a thought ,
bro plz give me one plus or any other phones ,
Can anyone pls suggest me should I buy galaxy S 8 or LG g7 now Awaiting reaponse,
I dont understand how every second person on YouTube become smartphone specialist,
Even though I love Apple more than Samsung I have to say the S8 looks good,
Theres always that ONE thing in this case shit placement of the fingerprint thing that ruins a phone for me RUINED,
Lol y Im always watching all these reviews when I know I cant purchase one,
Apple we have two cameras so our pictures are the best Huawei we have three cameras so our pictures are the best Google hold my beer,
Not sure why Im watching Google pixel 2xl reviews on my Google pixel 2xl lol,
Ordered a refurbished pixel first generation 32 gig the other day Package just came in accidently sent me a 64 gig pixel 2 Oh no p,
Who came after the pixel 3 reveal,
Why are they all removing the headphone jack Im simply not interested in a smartphone without one Surely a significant group of coustomers feel the same,
They want you to use the google buds that is why theres no jack,
Marques always has the best reviews period,
After seeing the pixel 3xl you realize how beautiful pixel 2xl was,
Watching phone reviews like I have money,
Who is here after Pixel 3 launch,
No headphone jack is the reason I will keep getting samsung These companies are losing customers by removing the jack,
Stock Android best camera amazing battery beautiful display beautiful yet simplistic build Im sold i will get the 2 xl when my Nexus 6p dies lol Please dont ever call an Android phone an iPhone of the Android market,
dat pewdiepie video lol,
Cant afford still watching lol,
I hate company making fun of other company and they gone ahead and do the same like no headphone jack Now I need to carry this dongle with me and had forgot a few times not a big deal breaker but WTF,
why is iPhone X so much costlier than pixel 2 xLfrom what I can see the pixel is better of the 2,
Currently running my iPhone 6 Been staying relatively up to date with what Apples been doing Nothing Ive seen so far has rocked my world enough to upgrade and Im genuinely impressed with how my iPhone has held up over the years But Im getting fed up with the little things Examples Instagram suiciding itself whenever I try to use the new features I dont even use Snapchat anymore because of how slowly it runs limited storage capacity and I refuse to pay for more cloud storage After watching no less than 30 videos comparing the best smartphones I think Im going to pull the trigger on the Moto G6 At only 250 it will at least serve as a wellperforming bridge until one of these phones really sets themselves apart to me Mr Brownlee keep slaying the reviews my friend,
Pixel 2 xl is now 350 on Amazon great deal if you ask me,
It didnt felt like a 18 minutes long video great editing and production,
To all the Australians thinking about getting this phone You do get headphones with this phone,
Quote Iphone of the Anroid world  ,
I was sold until I found out there was no headphone jack,
What a great job of reviewing  I like this guy,
You can also trigger a real assistant by squeezing their sides,
The n4 had wireless charging,
Phones without a headphone jack are a big deal breaker for me,
I might get this as my next phone,
Thankyou for making this video Ive been looking to buy a new phone and Ive been considering the Pixel 2 This video helped me in my decision and was extremely informative I look forward to seeing future videos of yoursHave a great day man,
I love watching MKBHDs videos again  again,
Hey thanks for the great review Much appreciated,
I actually clicked on this thinking it was the Pixle 3 review,
You didnt have to flex the royals though,
Im an iPhone user but I really like the look of all the new features modern android phones are getting especially the battery life All Apple are doing nowadays is adding tiny little features not many people will use every year and everybody still seems impressed,
Myhaha One of my buddies bought that shitty phone and week later hes was like bro please help me sell it,
pixel 2 XL  6 is truly mega 5 is best,
Share teh wallpaper link please,
When he said Okay Google my assistant came up on my phone while im watching the video lmao,
Google removing the Headphone jack is a Top 10 anime betrayal of 2017,
Damnit I was considering upgrading to pixel 2 xl because Im still on the OG and I firmly believe its not entirely necessary to have the newest version if the previous is still good and will cost less However I use my phone A LOT for IG and colours are so important Going into lightroom and dealing with that mess of not knowing what my edits are going to look like on other peoples screens is going to drive me insane This was so helpful in illustrating that,
I like the speakers on your desk What model are they ,
Marques did you know LG is responsible for the OLED display in the Pixel 2 XL the entire Pixel 2 XL phone is manufactured by LG ,
So I just got this phone and came here to see its features and When he said no headphone jack I FREAKED,
That moment you see a notification for a 17 minutes video from MKBHD you just gotta walk out of your deferential equation class and watch it Nothing was making sense in there anyway,
I was loving it until i saw it has no headphone jack,
this thing is worst product ever I will never buy any google product I had pixel 2 for over one year and my device had the issue with speaker that I couldnt hear anything from the phone google sent me a refurbished one and the problem still existed Making a phone call is an issue with a cell phone what do you need it for then It seemed they dont have any way to solve the problem and they wont refund you at all At lease Apple has good return policy My sincere advice stay away from GOOGLE,
Honestly one of my favorite built phones Just couldnt do the screen and speaker quality Looking to get one now,
Thank you for this comparison very helpful detailed explanatory Just the review I was looking for online Subscribed ,
Watch review No headphone jack Immediate pass,
Im just gonna subscribe because you are black and want it to be 10 million and you deliver the right message needed in short time Thank you,
Any link for the Wallpaper on Pixel 2 XL,
No way  pixel 3 is having a notch,
I like how you explain about the SRGB colours and relate it to your experience on editing images with the phone Loving your videos the more I watch them D,
I am really surprised he has not reviewed the Moto X4 on Android One with Project Fi,
Stopped watching upon hearing that theres no headphone jack ,
This thing is smart yet dont hav wireless charging no headphone jack no expandable memory Nah not for me,
I just caught the commercial and saw your quote and your name Congrats,
couple questions 1 do you have to use your finger to open it 2 is the camera timer good,
When you demand answers just squeeze your assistance really hard the continuation of the abusive relationship between the boss and the assistant,
OK _ OK I like it  But what is holarius to me is how we lower our expectation over time as PPL  I mean 4h battery time  God help us,
Legit scared me when you said ok Google and activated my home mini,
I appreciate your honesty,
Excellent review Thanks for posting,
everyday I am passing one or more hours to see review of new flagship but the thing is I can not afford  I am not poor but a student can not afford that flagship  ya  since to now  I am loving way pixel ,
Watching on my Pixel 2 XL I keep returning to always more so than my Galaxy devices in Sept 2018 Still love this phone and since the Pie update its gotten snappier and battery life has improved Keep improving Google,
They quoted you in their commercial Nice,
no wireless charging Darn,
Wow some innovative features Nice thanks for the review Sent from my iPhone X,
Upgraded from Galaxy S7 to Pixel 2 XL No going back,
You re the best continue,
shame on google for not including type c headphones in the box,
Excellent review My wife and I decided to change our HTC phones for Google phones Your review is confirming our choice thank you,
Thank you for this amazing review Detailed and to the point I currently have the first google pixel and have loved it from day one I changed from Iphone and its been the best choice I have made Again thank you for you great video,
Love the phone but the screen is way to small ,
Thumps up Good Video thanks a lot Buttake xl or normal,
As usual what a great video,
Reddit Relay  The other Reddit apps truly are no competition,
Hey Marques have ever heard about Pele the Brazilian football aka Soccer player,
Exceptional review thank you,
i was more into the resolution of your video than the review excellent quality bro,
I picked up the Pixel 2 for a vlogging outside Thanks  I had no idea you could toggle cameras with a shake,
enjoyed the review left intrigued by the disco ball,
you made a mistake Htc u ultra desnt have squize mode D,
looking at this today September 2018 its actually super interesting to me how much the Galaxy phone updates have adopted from the Pixel 2,
Google Pixel 2 Review THAT IS *17 MINUTES LONG* Shittttt,
Awesome reveiw bro You just earned yourself a like and a new subscriber,
This was a great video Very informative thank you,
Review the new Vivo X20 plus The very first smartphone with the inscreen fingerprint sensor display,
What wallpaper is that Mind sharing,
iPhone No headphone jack Google Pixel Hold My Beer No headphones in the box too,
Dude this is an impressive review You do a great job,
Google should at least include wireless head buds Rumors has it that the 3 xl will also not have any headphone jack,
Im so happy with my pixel 2 I had a Iphone 7 plus I wanted an upgrade didnt expect to get a phone that is in my eyes genuinely perfect,
I just noticed 440  MKBHD VS MKB240p,
Htc U11  squeeze feature is gimmicky Pixel 2  Thumbs up,
STILL WAITING FOR THAT CAMERA VIDEO MARQUES HELLO,
It seems like a really great phone But due to the display issues that you mentioned Ill just wait for the pixel 3,
Would 100 buy this phone but not without a headphone jack I live for my headphones,
Luckily the lack of a headphone jack isnt a big deal for me I prefer to go wireless anyway I think I may actually purchase this phone Great review,
They lost me with the no headphone jack smh wtf,
when you said okay Google it activated my Google assist Not cool,
Who in their right mind would mix Gregory Porter,
Need some features in this phone and fix display problem in upcoming model this will beat any other phone,
No headphone jack and the screen is a dealbreaker for me if they include this on the pixel 3 Im in,
You lost me at not having a headphone jack,
Wow What a great review I can stop looking for other reviews now Mad skills,
If all of these goddamn phone companies keep releasing phones without headphone jacksIm probably never going to upgrade again What is with this stupid trend,
No headphone jack WHY GOOGLE WHY ,
People calling marques sellout Well he makes reviews he says what he likesdislikes about a smartphone but some people expect from him to say what they think he should say if you know what i mean He clearly said if you dont like the display dont buy it get the note 8 for more saturated display Well I think marques brownlee is the most unbiased tech reviewer on YouTube and thats the reason why he is so popular As always INCREDIBLE VIDEO,
Does this phone still has touch sensitivity issues Please reply Thanks,
What app are you using for calendar in your middle screen I really liked the transparent background,
Android flagships RIP Samsung,
i enjoy the softer lighter in colors and brightness because i will keeping my eyeballs as i continue to grow older everydayhahaha burning balls,
Is it smarter than a 5th grader though,
Great review Honesty is a must for us looking for an opinion Thanks man,
That audio Jack is what killed this phone for me ,
O m g a rockets jersey I cannot watch this anymore,
hey anyone who has a pixel xl 2 having problems with charging it taking 6 to 7 hours to charge the from 5  to 100 ive had two of them and sent both back,
The quality over quantity is what defines mkbhd for me He doesnt care about just pushing out a review asap instead he acknowledges everything Even the small details D u r awesome Why does this have so many likes U guys made my day,
excellent review thank you Marques,
Awsome work man,
Gregory Porter Intro  Fire 3 ,
The Pixel 2 is a great phone The iPhone X is a great phone The Galaxys are great phones Can everybody stop shitting on other peoples preferences,
oh wait no headphone jack oh okie thank you for not wasting 17 mins for my life thank you checking other phones on youtube,
Could you please do a comprehensive review on the Lenovo Z5,
You do great reviews And I LOVE my pixel 2,
Where is the background wallpaper of the pixel 2xl from,
The front bezels on the pixel 2 are bigger than my future,
Informative thanks,
What camera did you used for this video Quality is great Congrats,
Does not complain of the rubber on the Pixel Complains about 2014 phones,
No wireless charging Meh skip,
I have to say that some of the comments are terrible Marques hasnt been shy about his preference for Android devices though he typically carries both an iPhone and whatever is his favorite Android device at the moment He has also expressed how important cameras are to him in his smartphones So how does this mean the guy being paid by Google for a favorable review FYI YouTube is owned by Google People talking about how black he is and his haircut Dont yall trolls have anything better to do than to be negative towards the young fella Guess you wish you were making his high 6 to 7 figures Terrible haters Keep up the good work Marques,
Actually the iPhones only have IP67 as well,
the iphone of the android world in that it has no headphone jack I bet some dumbcunt ex apple employee came up with the idea,
Smartest Ha lol face id no not to hate but yea,
Is it still worth to pick it up now Coming from a essential phone,
Excellent professional review thank you,
XD mkbhds voice when he was repeating on point,
Boi your hairline is going diagonal,
Very informative I hesitated at the 12 minute length glad I looked excellent work,
A 17min long MKBHD video YAAASSSSS,
The wallpaper of Pixel 2 XL plz MKBHD,
Killer intro,
this video got me to buy the XL ,
Stock Android seems so smooth,
If nobody comes from the future to stop you how bad can the decision really be,
You lost me at No headphone jack Very well produced video for a product thats not even worth considering,
Mine is coming in a few days and im hyped,
Great job We just switched from years of iPhones and your insight helped a lot,
Lol as soon as he said ok google in the video my google assistant came on,
When you said OK Google my Google assistant turned on,
Where did you find that wallpaper for the pix 2 I love it and I cant find it anywhere,
Is Pixel 3 coming out this year,
Google complexic unverifiable works better None profit Layer,

Wow  You did the best review on a product that Ive ever seen  You answered all my possible questions Thank you,
marques brownlee whats the wallpaper on pixel 2 xl,

I would like a pixel but that screen just doesnt do it for me And the pixel 3,
You own a tesla witch one,
When he said ok google my Google assistant pops up,
Do you remember the HTC M8 It first introduced the camera technology years ago It took shots to a whole new level,
Thanks for the concise review I can get it now for 0 on 2 year contract after trading in my S7 edge,
Just got this phone today and Im absolutely loving it,
May i know which app did you use for demonstrating video screenshot while editing a photo in your video thank you much appreciated,
the bokeh is aint on point,
Ha Pixel 2 is on sell at your local WalMart for Verizon for 151 total OR 7 of sales tax if you dont want to pay it all at once,
Feel like u want to squeeze harder,
Why doesnt the pixel 2 have duel Bluetooth speaker connection capability,
on point on point ON P O I N T,
Finally a phone with dual front facing speakers After 4 years I can finally replace my HTC One M7 Thank god,
Great review Today I just purchased a Pixel 2 XL and I love it It does everything very well,
Bluetooth headphones are always a thing I have like 3 pairs and theyre not that more expensive to regular headphones so it not having the headphone jack shouldnt really be an issue,
i have a pixel 2 xl i see NOTHING wrong with the display wtf,
Can u do a comparison video between google pixel 22xl and iPhone X,
Can we talk about the DISCO BALL that lowers OUT OF THE CEILING,
Please make videos in hindi language Love from INDIA,
I really wish it had a headphone jack because thats a deal breaker to me I really like the rest of the phone but I guess Ill get the Galaxy S9,
bruh i find you apple hater,
You activated my Google Home Speaker when you said Ok Google,
*Spam bots spam bots everywhere*,
Am in love with your passion to your job,
Impressive device Thanks for the review,
On point Im buying this phone AGAIN while I wait for the Pixel 4xl,
I hope Google keeps on going but with a headphone jack that would be really usefull,
I just ordered a black and white 2XL Ive used iPhones exclusively since the 3GS and always found it very limited in many ways Dont get me wrong Im definitely a fan of iOS and iPhones in general but Im excited to step out of that ecosystem and see what pure android has to offer A bit of offaxis blue shifting is definitely not a big enough issue to avoid the Pixel in my opinion There are so many more Ws in its column than there are Ls and if Im going to sink my teeth into android I want to experience it in its best form and be the first to receive updates when it inevitably gets better I considered getting an S8S8 for a bit but after seeing how well tuned Googles software experience is along with a few other things I liked much more about the Pixel 2XL it really wasnt a competition in my mind,
The best Pixel 2XL review out there Complete and honest Thanks,
Got them all I wish,
I have this phone its so AMAZING,
Youre sick Good video mate,
Woah the camera is incredible That pretty much sells it for me great review,
Lol Thanks again Everytime I get a new phone its you,
Awesome video Objective entertaining comprehensive great quality Subscribed,
Finally I can make those Watching on my Pixel 2 XL comments It DOES feel good,
I AM SOLD ON THIS THING,
You Need To Have Youtube Red Subscription for Picture In Picture Mode,

Man Just give me some link of the wallpaper you use Those are dope,
Ive never accidentally triggered the assistant and I dont when use a case You can set the sensitivity where you want,
the portrait mode on Pixel is incredible ,
ON POINT,
Damn I forgot how big bezels were on phones back then  Im specifically talking about the pixel 2 not xl its ugly af,
Thank you love your work,
Can you test some headphones Noise Cancelling Headphones,
I really want this phone but it doesnt have a headphone jack Honesty I dont use headphones THAT much,
apple is ip67 not 68,
Great video I think ill get this instead of the Pixel 3 XL that notch ugh,
When actress Anuksha Sharma has endorsed it It will be good I will go for it,
not saying the phone does have wireless charging but wireless charging doesnt necessarily not work through metal it just wouldnt really be practical through ferrous metals which aluminum is not,
Lmfao at the pic you Tweeted,
Google just quoted you on one of their google pixel 2 commercials,
Not smart enough to put a headphone jack on though I stopped watching after you mentioned that lol,
The whole time Im like Yes this sounds good Wow that sounds great but then he said those 3 words that kill phone sales No headphonejack and Im out Thanks for the heads up Ill keep looking,
No headphone jack **skipped**,
I get an iPhone ad for the Pixel review nice going Apple,
If someone is ok with the bezels on this phone but not the ones on the iPhone8 than they are COMPLETELY and utterly biased,
2 things they needed badly but 4 things to he worked on for the pixel 3 Put the headphone jack back in Put the expandable memory card slot back in Work on getting IP68  Put a better amoled QHD screen Then the pixel 3 will be unstoppable,

Why cant we have the OLED display of Samsung Build Quality of S8 Finger Print Sensor of Pixel 2 Battery of OnePlus 5 Camera Colours of iPhoneSharpness and Dynamic Range of Pixel and Software experience of Stock clean Android,
This thing is smart,
The iPhone of the Android world lol MKBHD,
Im watching this because I have one of these phones,
WhewFull video looked awesome in 4K,
Wallpaper,
When you said OK Google my video paused and google assistant came up Our voice matchi guess,
Hopefully on the next pixel 3 They have at least 256gb Although they use cloud to backup but I shoot a lot of videos 64gb doesnt cut it,
lol no headphone jack im out,
This is something you almost never see in your comments but you look fine XD Thanks for the review btw,
Ive had mine for a little more than a week and I love it,
From the background noise sounds like Marques has someone locked in a trunk,
Im buying this phone and this was such a helpful review to help me decide thanks,
Woah They quoted you in their commercial,
no head phone jack means I cannot use my square credit card reader at sales events,
Great review sir  love my pixel XL,
Its so good thanks for this and other video,
_Watching on an Alcatel Pixi 4 because my Pixel is being repaired_,
Damn this phones camera got exposed by Kai Wong,
YOU GOT A DISCO BALL IN YOUR OFFICE thats cool af,
Thank you for this video *,
125 pewdiepie spotted,
Just downloaded November patch The saturated mode is incredible Extremely satisfied,
Which is the best smartphone july 2018,
Just to add prople state that they cant hear me using the speaker phone as well as my previous S7 edge,
Genius the way you show the speed of fingerprint reader,
714 hehehehe *He said nuggets*,
Marques All of the iPhones are ip67 not 68,
They said at its release conference that the glass was polarized so you can use it well with sunglasses So are you sure its an error with the screen,
When you said ok Google my assistant came up,
I want the intro in infinite time loopbeen watching again and againnever gets tired of it,
Picture to picture on my pixel doesnt work,
everyone bashed LG for plastic coating the metallic G5 now that google has done the sameits cool and convenient and UNIQUE,
no doubt you are the best tech reviewer on YT keep up the good work Marques,
This is a great review Thank you,
Do you have a video of the best Android smartphone lens especially for the pixel phones,
Love your reviews I purchased the Samsung galaxy s8 last year after watching your reviews and a few others Best decision I ever made,
Can we have an LG V30 review,
Still stuck with my Nexus 6p,
Anyone have any idea on how to escalate pixel 2 xl RMA to proper channel who can actually resolve,
Everything is fine i wont disagreebut i want that pixel 2 xl wallpaper where i can get can anyone give me link pleaseeee,
Had anyone that has this phone realized that when the now playing feature is on it can pick up a Netflix show playing in the background,
Intro is dope,
Damn bro you got a real disco ball in your house,
what am i thinking right now i think i should change my 7 Plus to pixe 2xl,
Ok confirmed hes a Mr J mediros fan,
I really really really like your take on things man You have been and will probably continue to be a very well thought out video maker I have come back to your videos time and time again but for some reason I never subbed Why Im annoyed at myself,
Diamond pixel,
Love my lgv30 has everything ,
My phone activated Google Assistant as soon as you said Okay Google lol When tech reviewers have power,
Oh I found the pixel 2 xl for 415 and the Mate 10 Pro for 495 which one,
Cool review its time to get the Nexus 6P,
Apple products are ip67 samsung galaxy are ip68,
That was one of the best reviews Ive ever seen Great job with all of the details,
Ive watched this video too many times Im gonna get the google pixel 3 xl when it comes,
I notice a lot of reviewers no longer cover call quality The reviews are pretty much for PDAs,
i want smaller smart phones,
what smart phone do you recommend,
Hey Marques please leave a link to this awesome Wallpaper,
i like that background you have on the xl,
Will never EVER use an iPhone after Pix 2,
17 minutes of information for this wonderful device  Thank you,
I just feel like its Pixel 15 You can do a lot of these things on the pixel as well exceptional with hardware changes Will probably just go with the LG V30,
No headphone jack was the deal breaker for me,
Keep such videos short and to the point,
so i am switching from iPhone 7 to either the Pixel 2 or Samsung Galaxy S8 I havent used android for 3 years,
Marques will the XL be your new daily driver,
Can you please do a video to contrast between iPhone X and Pixel 2,
Apple Yo can i copy your homework Samsung Yeah sure but dont make it obvious Apple Edit bruh shook didnt think this would go off LOL,
who is watching this after the iPhone 8 came out lol,
I mean people break their phones anyway *holding a cracked phone* lol,
Becoming less unique soon the only difference between Apple and android will the the price tag that comes with the logo,
Who came here after watching iPhone X launch event,
Bruh It looks like a ANDROID SMARTPHONE,
Funny watching this in 2019,
I am pretty sure in the future Apple will come out with customizable phones just like laptopsAdding a headphone jack400Adding screen600 etc In the end we will have a phone which costs as much as all the organs,
Was that a real snake I saw it breathe,
This is literally the X,
its 2017 and people are still fighting over which phone is better Just be happy your mommy and daddy bought you a expensive phone,
Have fun with your new iPhone its a Galaxy S8 Great Value Edition lol,
Great Quality MKBHD Big Fan,
Id like to see Steve Jobs reaction to this phone,
Watching this on galaxy s8 glad i didnt wait for the iPhone 8,
I think the black model with a black themed wallpaper on the phone would make it look amazing,
To all those saying how ugly it is etc just remember that when the iPhone 6 was announced everyone said the same thing purely because the design deviated from what was custom at that point Also this is just a concept still no one truly knows until its released,
Im surprised Apple hasnt removed the charging jack since theyre all about a wireless future,
Samsung employee Boss the new iPhone 8 model is out What do we do Samsung executive Dont worry Its fugly,
Which fidget spinner you have,
That fidget spinner rotates like by itself The center of those things dont move like that,
The iPhone 8 review me  look at that fidget spinner go,
I think the black color of this will look better to hide the top sensors,
Samsung copied Apple then after Steve Jobs death Apple copys Samsung now,
triggered by the fidget spinners in the background,
Well i am loving that fidget spinner D,
the name was the biggest disappointment of the phone for me other than the notch Why iPhone X cant it be iPhone 10 it is just so confusing,
Finally IPhone Made It  No Barslines on the Back  I Like It  No I actually Love It ,
That fidget spinner distracted me,
a secret fidget spinner never stops spinning in the video,
Apple removed headphone jack now the home button and then the camera,
Desing 0 Price799 From now Waiting Samsung S9,
2017 the yr Apple plays catch up designwise,
Theres no way apple will make that ugly of a product,
Thank you so much for not making every video 10 minutes long,
Its funny because this is like what LG did They just reduced the top and bottom bezels but the side bezels are still wide AF,
That fidget spinners center moving,
Iphones are better than samsung phones SH*T I DONT HAVE POP CORN,
AppleHey Can I borrow your designs Samsung Yeah just change it a little bit so no one will know,
The iPhone model is cool but Im more impressed that a Shakka song was used in the intro,
you know what apple business strategy is Not first but BEST,
I phone 8 So stupid they gotta stop Making more iPhones,
lets make it so that it breaks even easier GENIUS,
That phone is just UGLY Would never buy one edit BRUH I did not expect all these likes Now i feel kinda bad for hating on the design and YES I know this isnt the final product,
You got your music from Spandau Ballet Classy,
Not loving the spinner and the snake props,
Global obsession on the bezelless displaysYes sure these phones look good but I appreciate software features more than doubtful design solutions,
Why are we blind to the fact that mobile technology has been and still is really dry Give us something innovative,
Ill stick with my 6s that does pretty much everything this will,
I just like scrolling through the comments and being like *DEVICE WAR 1 SAMSUNG VERSUS APPLE* And the screen seems a bit too wide Its exposed to damage,
Really like your videos Beautiful short and good information Thank you so much,
After Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 design and specs for Apple there is no more steps to go down,
2016 genaration No 35mm jack 2017 generation No battery D,
I cannot focus on the phone because of the fidget spinner spinning in the background,
Wasting time with a fidget spinner,
iPhone now looks lyk crap they removed the signature home button now it lyk any other Android plus they decided to twist the camera vertically Damnn,
Firstly they should try to keep the sar value low,
Doesnt really have that crisp clean design I like from apple,
Im just waiting for this phone to come out because I want the 7 plus but its price will drop once the 8 is out so I can save more money lol,
Dude they basically brought back the best iPhone look from 4th generation Awesome  Too bad Im already deep into Android,
Android,
iOS 11,
Anyone else still using a smartphone from 5 years ago,
This iphone x now So maybe you can make many of the and sell them as clones You know,
Samsung Trend setters of premium quality and rulers of the smart phone kingdom Iphone Been making dummies and calling them phones since 2007,
The iPhone 8 will be my first IPhone will you do a tutorial for it me us And how do I add my picture to this thing,
That random fidget spinner tho,
No headphone jack apple not taking my money,
Throwback to when MKBHD nailed the iPhone X design thinking it was the iPhone 8,
The iPhone looks really good bigger screen in a smaller body Love it why has no one else thought of this,
yes THIS IS TRUE MODEL WHICH I SEEN 1 MONTH EARLIER 1ST TIME,
I saw a figdet spinner,
The white front looks so bad I hope that they will make the white color but without the white front,
The thing on the wall on the right side is not in line with the others D HOUUUS THAAAT POSSIBRUUU D,
Here now in December 2017 damn this wasnt all that off besides the name haha,
All this guesswork I Think folks Will be dissapointet,
This can be the iPhone 8 Because should you have an iphone and we not ,
No disrespect but every previous iPhone design looks 10x better than this onegood thing this is just a prototype thoughright,
I was hoping for a better design   I guess Ill have to wait for the iPhone 10 lol,
Haha Spandau Ballet intro music nice,
Mehjust another yearly smartphone The next upgrade for me will be when a smartphone comes out that doesnt break when you drop it and one that a thief cant simply hook up to a pc and flash the os and imei Those are real improvements but ones that will reduce their own sales So more than likely we will just keep getting better cameras and screens,
I think its ugly or at least jarring Doesnt photograph well and I am very skeptical of 3D facial recognition How well does it work in low light What about when I am driving and want to do simple tasks like advance the track  Lots of questions that need answered Intial reaction is to stick with the safer 7s design which I am sure will have the same fast internals Or at least wait for 8s,
The iPhone 4 with the glass back is still my favorite design,
bro what camera do you use its so high quality,
BRACE YOURSELF THE iSHEEP ARE COMING,
Hmm Im still rocking the iphone 5s I was gonna wait for the 8 but I think I might just get the 7 plus,
This is a dummy model and people saying it looks cheap The world has no hope,
Who is here after the giveaway announcement,
Im surprised many people in the comments dont like this design because this model is actually my favorite one to date To be fair the white color doesnt do it justice I think judging by the glossy material that this phone will look much better in black The glass back and the chrome edges look more classier The larger screen to phone size ratio is much more practical than buying a larger phone for a larger screen with bulkier edges The only thing I didnt like with this model is how the white edging on the front facing cameras is awkwardly placed They should have just extended the edges instead of keeping the corners bare Its not like the corners are going to be actively used or even touched so the design doesnt feel effective It will also distract users when playing games or watching movies I dont even know how notifications will be placed when the edge stands in the way I feel like the majority will purchase this model in black so the awkward top edges are less visible with the black screen when turned off,
People Saying this Ugly But they all buy it the 1000 Animoji Machine iphn X,
your fidget spinner are awsome,
So theyre making the iPhone 8 look more like an Android Steve Jobs in heaven right now mad af Edit Im talking about an android phone If you put an edge on the new iPhone 8 itll look similar to the Samsung S7,
Its upsetting that apple has took away the headphone jack because not many people can afford to buy air pods etc,
Apple removes the Fingerprint scanner for OLED display Wireless charging Small bezels Power buttonlike Sonys smartphones Facial Recognition I say its worth it p,
Is that yamaha hs 8 speaker in the background,
What fidjet spinner u r using,
starting to look like an android if you ask me,
Yo great video   I was looking for your thoughts on the Essential Phone but couldnt find anything Are you gonna be making a video on that I would love to hear your input on it,
Steve Jobs would be so depressed with the progress Apple has made,
Plz I want a strong start to continue with confidence,
Really had to get the fidget spinner in the shot huh Lol,
quite ugly way to make the bezels smaller,
i really appreciated all the cool background props haha,
What if u have a twin,
thanks I am finding out more about 8 braden brand sister reality tv,
This is actually pretty good It looks so legit,
Apple starts to sell iPhone 8 soon and I I cant buy the iPhone 4 yet,
anyone else notice the spinning fidget spinner,
Im on the annual upgrade plan so Im getting a new one regardless I love the fact that ill be just slightly bigger than the 7 but with the same screen real estate as the Plus Cant wait to get one,
please get the fidget spinner out of the shot,
Im so glad to see a str8 guy with nice clean nice looking hands Lol,
Im watching this on my bed at night Does that mean I wouldnt have been able to unlock my iPhone 8 because it cant see me Ignoring touch passcode,
This is just like an Android phone BTW I think this is a proto type,
Thats gonna be a problem with people with fullhardcore make up on,
Steve Jobs rolling in his grave,
S8 Period,
Mkbhd Rocks Videos Are now Coming Faster 1 Week 5 Videos,
I phone prices are very high the first year  but after a few months the price becomes half that shows how cheap actually apple is whereas Samsungs price never goes down cuz its expensive not like apple,
So disappointed about the glass back I used to have a galaxy s6 edge and the glass back cracked on the first drop,
If the end product honestly looks like that Im not buying its ghastly,
This looks like a crappy china phone Camera sticking out and not color matching the back chrome sides wtf This looks cheap and ugly The only nice thing is the display,
Double the thickness double the battery Im still looking for a modern smartphone which can last all day and go far into the night,
Marq B please quit with the snakes bro Good review by the way,
Tbh it aint even ugly But when I upgrade from my 7 next year Im just gonna get the 7 plus Im not wasting more money itll be cheaper by next august while the 8 wont dont wanna be that broke,
The iPhone I bought from a Chinese shop charged up to 103 switched off with a Samsung logo and wont start now Help me Marques,
The model just looks Weird Idk Im just not a fan of it Theres just something off about the look but maybe the software will improve the lookfeel of it,
Whos watching this right before the 3 new 2018 iPhones release,
Im good I love my Galaxy S7 edge Waiting for the Note 8,
They copied galaxy s8 infinity screen,
That screen design could allow you to see the time and battery life whilst in a full screen application like a game unlike now its hidden to save screen space in most,
samsung is looking tight AF after this but i cant leave now everything i store digitally is apple dammit,
Im not digging that brow at all Apple needs to realize that those chins brows and thick bezels are quickly growing out of favor,
Samsung high price Apple high quqlity,
if they make status bar black it would blend pretty well,
After spending a premium on a 3 version older device I hopefully will be able to get it in 2020 ,
this is one gorgeous phone well done apple,
Your videos are great Keep up the great work,
Anyone else see the fidget spinner,
Apple fanboys be like Its beautiful,
This video is very close to what actually came out,
Who else got iphone 8 convirsel befor the vid,
Please make a video on LG q6,
I Used Clips from this Video in my video Dont Worry I Gave Credit Thanks for being a big inspiration for me,
I dont really like the design in my opinion,
You have bug eyes,
Finally Thats one good change in design I guess ey Apple,
Looks like an older galaxy note,
Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8 battle whos gonna win,
everyone watches video me watches the revenge of the fidget spinner in the background,
Honestly the design looks mediocrewhen he says it looks super premiumI am done,
its the bloddy IPHONE X,
I love the new look If I knew this was going to be the new design I would have thought twice about buying the Oneplus 5,
Irrelevant but I got so hyped when I heard Say Nada start playing,
Im a simple man I see a fidget spinner  I dislike,
Looks so much like the actual x,
No headphone jack is a total deal breaker,
Ive been missing the glass back since iphone 4s,
Im just gonna buy xiaomi phone,
the spidget spinner has taken over the world,
Did you pay for that Shakka intro,
I like android more but I really like the style of the new iPhone ,
DISPLAY  MADE BY SAMSUNG CAMERA MADE BY LG BATTERY MADE BY SAMSUNG,
Im just waiting for TechRax to Destroy this Phone,

I swear this phone will break just by taking it out of the box,
Camera looks like a traffic light,
Ill stick to my OnePlus 3Tway better than this Period,
We call it notch these days,
Watch out for all of the Samsung fanboys who are getting proper salty in the comments,
I cant help but think that it looks like something Google would make,
xiaomi mi mix looks a bit more clean than this and original because of the earpiece nevertheless at least apple is doing some kind of new stuff,
I prefer iOS over android so Im probably gonna end up getting it lol,
Hey Marques My name is Kyle I was working at the ChickfilA you ate at an hour ago It was so cool to see you Hope you enjoyed the food,
Apple helping idiots who are technologically impaired look smart,
Rumours are ramping up  Pixel 2  NOTE 8 keen for that 2017 new phone feel,
V NICE TO SEE AMERICAN BOIS GIVING GRIME A BIT OF LOVE,
ill stick with my Nokia 1100,
D*mn Look just like iron man mask,
The intro music is trash my dude,
FINALLY Apple gets rid of those hideous bezels,
Glass back Yep thatll break easily,
eesh not feeling that design or the glass finish being back glass is a fingerprint magnet,
lol dats iPhone X,
Looks like a kids toy,
Your lisp is hurting my ears,
Just get the LG G6 it looks exactly the same as this but better made,
You were hoping for the iPhone 8 and instead you got the iPhone 6 For the 3rd time,
Hey do you play ultimate frisbee Marques,
Will it have a fidget spinner though,
I like the Kevin Durant cameo tbh,
I can see you are too biased towards iPhone,
Yay 8 totally not a 10 now,
is it just me or is it kinda ugly,
my fiance has iphone 7 nice phone but dont do full screen photosonly while recording i hope 8 series will get this issue fixthanks,
Best phone hands down,
Watching this on my s8 like Yikes still happy I didnt get an iPhone Left that shit 2 years ago and never going back,
ehm sir thats the iphone X,
Theyre making iPhones look like galaxies,
Nope I wouldnt buy it if it comes out looking like what you just shown us,
you have uchiha itachis under eye lines,
TFHD800S in the back on redNiceeee,
this is proof that apple has been slowly dying ever since jobs passed away this new design looks like a lot of lg and samsung elements awkwardly bolted onto a perfectly good iphone,
Apple is starting to copy Samsung what a turn of events,
i will buy a samsung galaxy S8 plus,
Oeff ugly camera bump and outcut for almost double the price of a Galaxy S8 Must be out of your mind,
What is the storage capacity going to be for iPhone 8S Plus,
Snake  I think it is a ball python,
I swear wait a couple of years its gonna be a touchscreen brick,
still no aux port whats the point,
Okay couple number of iPhone numbers off but youre good,
Oh no bby what is you doing,
remember sony xperia,
if you think the iPhone 8 looks better than a s8 youre delusional,
Id rather have a full metal back than wireless charging through glass,
They should place the fingerscan on the powerbutton,
This is X not 8,
Hi my name Steve Jobs i director company Apple this is a IPhone ten X,
does it have a headphone jack tho,
Looks realllllyyy similar to the s8 Smaller bezels glass back Apple wasnt really steering towards those things until the s7 or s8 did really well with that design,
looks like a 201314 HTC phone,
A Snake on The Table,
BRUH DID I JUST SEE A SNAKE,
And Finally looks like a Android lol,
SAMSUNG NOTE 8 AND SAMSUNG S8,
Marques fam see you jamming with BBK proper lit bruv,
a like for that cutie little snake 3,
Gonna laugh my ass off when Apple announces the 7S Then 2 months later theyll announce the 7S Anniversary edition,
LOL at the spinner,
sensor bump and camera bump and this is going to be 1k ,
Make a video on nokia 8,
Sad to say it looks like an android,
Dock for a lot for a lot and then the way I will have,
nasty looking If youre gonna copy at least do it right,
Well we now know it has a black bezel,
yeah Im very interested and curious,
iphone is getting older it even has a receding hairline now,
I would rock this phone but I dont need it UGH,
Dude i like your channel but please remove the snake man I hate snakes Many people do and this is a big deal Enough to be a channel watch breaker,
whos watching after the release of the iphone x,
Apple is usually AHEAD of the pinnacle designs of smartphones Whether you like it or not that is the design of the future As a designer we appreciate what Apple designs To the average consumer who does not have a vision of design it might look ugly But to us designers it looks fantastic Going to get the new iPhone as soon as it is out Afterall I do make 75k annually,
Is it juts me or do the side bezels look bigger than previous iphones,
say nada ya yeet,
The front bezels drive me nuts ugh,
Heyhow come in the bit with the screen on part it still uses the dots for the signal strength bars,
Im just going to say what everyone is thinking This phone is crappy,
look so dopethat would be great if the fingerprint is on that apple logo,
*steals,
That is A iPhone x,
I can still see the bezels on the iphone X ,
Looking forward to some cracked screens,
they actually got it nearly bang on except the name and the hideous white front,
think ill just buy an iphone 6 outright instead of upgrading to this lol,
Ofcourse infinite display like samsung,
Those vertical dual camera is major turn off for me,
Get that fidget spinner out of here,
Marques using that shakka in the intro I like that,
Lmao Samsung got rid of the side bezels years ago with their edge displays good to see apples still 3 years behind as always,
Nice looking Android Phone Wow,
Hey Marques this Everything Apple Pro guy releases a video every 10 minutes Its just a rehash of every rumor he can find I absolutely hate watching this guy and wont watch his videos anymore He is Mr Click Bait Your videos have more substance and I enjoy watching you,
Might have a good screenbody ratio but still ugly ,
Ok Im going to keep my 6S,
And to answer the Q Hell nah,
looks like that new essential phone brand,
Jesus is King 3,
People arguing about which brand is better and stuff Dude I would kill to get a phone like this yeah Im stuck with the S3,
yo marques quick question what do you recon is the best windows laptop for video editing around the 1500 pounds mark 1900 dollers aprox I work for a local production company primarily using pc and running adobe software  and Im looking to match that performance with a laptop any recommendations,
No iphone 8 yes samsung galaxy s8 nice good video,
Fidget spinner huh,
Did he forget that the iPhone 4 also had a glass back,
who is watching this on Android device ,
Kind of wish it was biggerbut will defo end up getting it if the camera specs are better than the 7,
I will stick on my Charlie Cunningham  Minimum Chill Out Your Heart Remix until the iphone 10 release,
NicePhone,
Am i the only one that loves both android and apple I love fucking up my phone with all the customization on android though lol,
First thing first Imma say all the words inside my head,
Its an iPhone 10 common MKBHD,
ssheeeeitttt if apple keeps this up i might have to switch to that bad boyshoutout to that shakka tune by the way ,
Wow Rectangular and a screen wow Just wow,
So if someone knocks you out they can scan your face and take your phone and credit card info and other info thanks,
This phone makes Nokia look like a super model,
I hope OnePlus doesnt copy this,
Since when is having small bezels copying android phones you guys are so extra lmao,
X,
That chrome metal frame and the buttons on it look cheap af,
iPhone 8 now with a higher likelihood for display fracture so Apple can get more money,
The iPhone didnt always have a metal back up until now the 4 and 4s had glass backs,
Worried shock across pose doctrine writer,
It looks super nice with all that screen,
Apple still havent fix the budging camera Hope the iphone 8 sales drop will change their opinion,
All this talk about the iPhone 8 going on but nearly nothing about the 7s ,
iPhone Who are you OnePlus Im you but stronger,
I made the move from Samsung Galaxy S7 to OnePlus 5 and I have to say it was absolutely worth it I have had the OP5 for a month and this is my load down Dont get me wrong S7 was a great phone but the OP5 is so much better OP5 took the best from Apple and Android and made a solid phone Battery life is on point and Dash Charging puts it over the edge The customization with the everything is fantastic The OS is just clean I am a very pleased customer Oh one more thing Headphone jack,
2017 They are a small company and dont have acces to all the cutting edge technologies OnePlus in late 2018 *Hold my beer*,
Yeah a copy cat company but Steve Jobs once said Good artists copy great artists steal I love the design,
Why do I watch these videos I still have an iphone4,
WHY IS HE LOOKING SOO SAD IN THE THUMBNAIL,
I dont really know what people expect phones to look like I mean they are all 1 basic shape,
When the front facing camera is better than your phone back camera,
Those voices those voices those voices in my head,
2016 Marques complained about the bump * OnePlus fixed that * 2017 Didnt even mention that in the review * OnePlus cries*,
Dont copy Siri *BIXBY*,
they did not become a copycat company this is a company thats listening to the fans and giving the fans what they want a flagship phone for half of the price if you call that copycat I have to admit you crazy oh yeah I forgot and they are not a small company they just a little bit more organized and after you finish crucifying the whole phone specs you gave it a thumbs up I dont understand but this a big contradiction in between this whole video,
copying apple  Where else exactly do you want to place a camera  Middle top and then you call it a samsumg rip off  lol,
Anybody watching this on a OnePlus 5 ,
Copy the good stuff copy the camera but dont copy the bad stuff dont copy Siribixby,
Got a 128GB HDD 8GB ram OnePlus 5 today upgrading from a Samsung S5 must say this is a fantastic phone was around 200 cheaper than the S8 and as he says if you get past the infinity screen its honestly worth your while Plus the phone is very reactive and no lag spikes no matter how much is running I only just heard about OnePlus yesterday in store Certainly will be looking forward to their future work as they come more prominent in the market As for the camera its very clear absolutely ideal for what I need my camera for,
am i the only one who likes bezels,
I made the decision to upgrade to this phone from my Galaxy Note 3 and so far its been the best decision I couldve made 1080p is more than enough for me since my eyes arent electron microscopes and I hold my phone at a reasonable distance from my face,
As someone who is among the 65 of people who doesnt have 2020 vision why would I spend as much as 500 for little more than slightly higher resolution and poorer performance I think 1080p is truly taking the consumer into account rather than charging us more for something we dont benefit from so they can earn bragging rights,
who else googled one plus 5 and a calculator poped out,
454 that miata tho,
Do anyone know that MKBHD was the first one to buy oneplus 5,
Dont copy the bad things Siri Bixby Im still laughing 4 months later about this I came back just to hear itLOLOLOLOL,
whos here after one plus 6t,
When your phone has more RAM than your PC ,
Oneplus tricked everyone into thinking that they are a small company Honestly they are not,
Does it have an earphone jack,
Dont copy like Siri or something Bixby I died laughing,
15 is 6 ok ill stop,
432 BEEXBY i died,
Bruh I have a J1 480p display shut the hell up about 1020 being low,
Plus 5 s8 and iPhone X are going to be best phones this year,
My day is not complete without your channels notification then my day isnt complete without a doubt that I have to go to the gym and then I will be there for me to Come,
Mah name i Bixby Ha Got eeeee Got eeeee My real name is Google Assistant,
Oppo vivoOnePlus are from the same companywhat should we expect thenlol,
One plus 5  6,
One plus 5 camera are really impress me I like them,
Anyone have a link to that wallpaper,
honestly I regretted not buying the 5 over the 5t Dont get me wrong its just that I prefer having bezels for gripping and the slighly longer battery,
Wait Mario kart 8 in the background,
Marques great review Been watching you since I first heard about the Oneplus 1 Keep up the great work and thanks,
Watching on my OnePlus 5,
When he quietly whispered Bixby in the background,

4K now gets EIS in the Oxygen 458 update,
Without 3x carrier aggregation and 4x mimo I cant do it A great chip but itll never make full advantage of it,
Hey MKBHD what are the widgets you have here on the OnePlus 5,
202 Oppo and OnePlus are owned by the same company,
they want you to focus on the camera on the box but your camera cant focus the box,
Just a rip off Lenovo Zuc z2 do review its amazing,
No I have to look at it not its very important It has to look good Although this One Plus looks generic not having unique design que,
Protip People coming from the Moto X Pure Edition get the OP 5 with the Karbon Fiber BACK COVER not the case I have not regreted it yet,
Soo basically Its the perfect phone with everything you will ever need to run any and every mobile app because NO mobile app needs super high Specs to run on,
That bixby killed me XD,
I thought you said dont get one at the end and I was like Well that was a curve ball,
will for me Marques voice beast hehe love his voice so manly,
I dielaughing when you say *No pun intended*,
FACT  OPPO and ONEPLUS are same parent company,
433 didnt yall notice Marques saying bixby subtly in the background when he says dont copy Siri,
Dont copy the bad stuff Dont copy like Siri or something *mumbles* Bixby,
Remember the day oneplus actually listen to their customer ,
this is SO smart love his knowledge and videos GodBless,
iphone 6 copies HTC 1  no one cares oneplus 5 copies iPhone 7  OMG THEY COPIED APPLE GAHHHHHHHHHHH,
Bunch of thanks Marques for constantly sharing a fantastic review,
I remember buying the Oneplus One based on your recommendation Loved it now i cant wait to use this one,
but does it have headphone jack  lol like the can it run crysis meme ,
you said there arent a lot of phones which can give u this at this price so which are those phones cheap but loves smartphones,
432 That moment when he says Bixby lol,
I have this phone and I Love it The video quality is amazing I filmed you YouTube vlogs with it come and check them out,
watching this review on my oneplus 5,
does new 15 has preinstalled screen protector,
Actually theres no fking difference between 1080p an 1440p display beside performance,
Where is HTC U11 review I noticed also that all top comments about u11 are dissapearing which is really strange,
Whoa your shirt is awesome lol Im from Jersey,
Oppo r11 and one plus 5 look similar cus One plis is a subsidiary of Oppo,
one plus 5 6 illuminate confirmed,
Is the 8gb of ram optimized,
Am i the only dumb one that looked at the thumbnail and said 6,
I have a Moto Z Play I only wanted a phone with a good battery Loved it since,
Can you use usbc flash drives on the oneplus 5,
got one yesterday 470 AUD shipped,
MKBHD and MrMobile are the only reviewers worth watching,
Watching this on OnePlus 5,
really youtube A 1 minute UNSKIPABLE AD,
Watching this video again on my new One plus 5,
where did you get the wallpaper from that is so amazing can you send me the link,
OnePlus is owned by BBK Electronics BBK has 9000 employees and OnePlus makes up less than 1000 of those employees To put that into perspective Samsung has 325000 employees BBK Electronics is also made up of 3 different phone brands OnePlus Oppo and Vivo while Samsung only has one They are a small company in an industry run by giants EDIT Im aware Samsung has other revenue streams all this means is they have more money to spend on RD You cannot expect Samsunglike features on BBK phones because they dont have the disposable income to develop such features,
Can do a comparison with LG G6 and this onesince they are now at the same price almost,
Dont copy like Siri or something  bixbi HAHAHA I died Im getting the S8 or N8 soon but I really do not want bixbi and hope I can customize the damn button,
Watching this on my OnePlus 5,
Should i switch from note 8 to oneplus 5t,
If you copy something try to better than the original Thats the only way to justify your good intention of giving the best concept or idea that already exist,
Watching on OnePlus 6T,
wowohh god its a 1080p display it must be awfulfirst world problems,
This phone is unavailable for purchase because of being totally sold out Thats crazy,
Dude you are one of the best youtubers in the gameiron your freaking shirt,
Im using OnePlus One and its still fire,
Does OnePlus 5 have 32 bit or 24 bit audio,
Can we watch 4k videos in youtube,
Lol smh waste of money My Samsung j7 perx is way cheaper And only cost me 80 bucks,
The vibration motor is a lot stronger  so if youre into that,
where is the HTC u 11,
Come on Marques give us a Nintendo Switch review,
I love how the whole review he never mentioned how well the actual calls are,
The 15 looks great,
Great review You do them well Very informative,
Watching in 2019 on my OP5,
How would you compare it with Moto Z2 play besides the specs since both are in the same price range,
Welcome to the new KING PHONE ONEPLUS 5T,
The best Design From This company is still One Plus X,
marques can u Plz do a comparison video for Honor 8 pro vs oneplus 5 Plz many ppl might be interested,
Marques Brownlee I love your tech review since 2013thank you,
That LG wallpaper TV is killing me 3,
Can you do comparison between oneplus 5 vd Nokia 8 in all aspects and suggest which is good to go with,
Marquessorry if I spelt your name wrong please do a give away I absolutey love your vids And I really really REALLY want a one plus 5,
Thanks for the great review on the OP5 marques browniee I am definately gonna buy this beauty Wanted to know which car racing game you were playing in the video,
It has to feel good more than it has to look good Agreed which is why we need the design of the OnePlus One back The sandstone backing and slick design was honestly one of the biggest selling points of OnePlus but now Im waiting on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 to upgrade,
I have bought OnePlus 3t two months ago should I upgrade to OnePlus 5,
So youre telling me a smartphone has the same amount of RAM as my PC I better start upgrading,
Awesome review thank you for sharing,
can you give wallpaper link,
small company lmao,
11 looked the best imo,
DONT COPY THE BAD STUFF bixby xD,
The go to guy for all your review needs,
Does one plus 5 Oxygen OS supports Multi user mode,
You didnt talk about the student mode ,
I CRACKED UP PRETTY BAD ON THE BIXBY PART,
Anyone else think that when he said Go and get one he said Dont get one,
Guys i have a problem My Oneplus 5 keeps sending me update recommends at night when im sleeping So basically i have two questions now 1 How do i stop Oneplus 5 from sending update messages 2 If i cant stop them from coming then how do i silence the update messages,
dude didnt event mention the dual sim functionality and the fact that it has like almost every band youd need he probably never leaves the garden state frisbee field,
Oneplus 5 vs Lumia 950 XL,
I have a moto g5 plus with pixel experience 64bit oreo 81 on Would a 15 t be a good investment Or pixel2 or pixel 2 xl *really confused in value for money,
Please do a review for the HTC U11,
Hello Marques does Oneplus 5 comes with photo face tag like Galaxy S5 please lmk,
I like the OnePlus 5 because of the RAW processing power it provides with a stock Android build Also the Midnight Black color looks epic,
Love your videos Thanks for the recommendation,
Cheaply put together read conversation below,
Still prefer the design of the 3T tbh,
Watching this on my Oneplus2,
I thought people established that One Plus is not a young or small company,
Marques Browlee  If you want to copy other phone copy the good stuff Me  Agreed and addition make it better Thumbs Up for the Marques  Nice review ,
I think infinity displays are over hyped Even with the sidebars deactivated and a shell on I am always exiting apps or unable to writeclick on something because it senses my hand on the edges SUPER annoying,
thanks one plus i feel much better owning an older one plus 3t now after this release,
HI MKBHD i always follow u  i love oneplus5 its to much beautiful  the best but my financial condition is not that good So it will remain in my dreams,
One plus 5 is way more better than iphone x,
Dont copy the bad stuff like Siri *bixby*,
does this ship to australia,
506 Is that GTA 6,
Video I am happy with this phone  Thumbnail  please kill me,
So basically a 6,
Super fast processing Super fast charging Super fast fingerprint scanning the ceramic home button totally Sik I bought 1  58 gig for 190 mint condition as an upgrade from oneplus 3 and its totally worth it,
Do a review for xperia XZ premium,
at least it has a headphone jack,
Which camera is better ONEPLUSE 5 OR XIAOMI MI 6  Its hard for me to decide,
Whenever I see a phone with a chin and forehead the size of an iPhones I immediately discard it NEXT,
Weve now seen the 15 review but would love to see the 22  4  1 is 3 quick Maths phone Keep us updated on its release please ,
s 6 QUICK MAFFS ,
Is MKBHD a *small* company,
Love Your reviews Thank You,
Hahahathat dude know how to tease apple fanboy,
does the lack of stabilisation in the camera mean it doesnt focus well and images may come out blurred,
Dont copy the bad stuff like Siri sudden voice bixby lol lol nice,
I heard bixby,
Could you please review sony xz premium,
please do a review on OPPO r11,
i still love my moto x pure edition because its not a copy of any phone its unique in terms of design,
At 433 When he says Bixby,
Soo should i buy iphone 7 or oneplus 5 Ive watched so many reviews but still cant decide,
B I X B Y,
Is it weird that my computer has 16gb of RAM Ok yeah I know its weird,
I think one plus company is deserve for comparing with iphone ,
wallpaper on the phone  Poly Squad by  Samen Zayer backdrops app,
Does anyone know if theyll bring out a OnePlus 5T version Or is it to early to say Lol,
I was looking to buy 15 shall i go for it or is there a better phone in same range,
They shoulda called it the OnePlus 6 cause this ho look like a 7Plus,
I relally hope they dont move on to 1440p next phone I really prefer the extended battery life and imprpved performance over higher resolution ,
hit the like button if u heard him whispering bixby after saying siri,
433 he said Bixby hilarious,
Dang I want the oneplus 5 really bad but Im on verizon and its not on there ,
I see a wallpaper TV,
oneplus  oppo Never Sttle  Steve Jobs,
Who else just watched JerryRigEverythings video,
Nexus 6p camera kills OnePlus5 camera,

One Plus 5  Six,
When is the HTC U11 review coming,
Siribixby,
Whats the Front camera Megapixel,
455 nice miata,
can you do a review on the Xiaomi A1 and share your thoughts about the upcoming A1 phones from HTC and Motorola,
The vibration is stronger if you are into that thats good,
i use it still working as new after a year,
Dual camera setup,
Id buy this if the bezels werent so chunky and a little nicer battery life Everything else looks like a pretty nice design good work 1,
He is somehow an Apple fanboy ,
I think the problem is high end version of this phone 8 GB RAM128 GB storage is 540 It is not cheap anymore Right now on amazon I can find 64 GB version of LG G6 for 517 and Samsung Galaxy S8 for 678 So flagship killer is not a correct saying for it I think correct saying would be It is another flagship that fights other flagships  Even though it is a great phone I dont think it has a big advantage this year,
OnePlus 5 is a beast,
I had enough of the Galaxy bootloops No matter what version I owned at one point or another they suffered from the bootloop In re to the S8 I hear it is very fragile No thank you Im going to try the OnePlus5t,
Awesome phone I got the 6 plus rn Im gonna jump off the apple brand for my next phone Im gonna keep my eyes on these guys,
S7 Edge or the One plus 5,
roses are red violets are blue the new oneplus 5 has more ram than your laptop,
bro I bought one plus 5 one month agoone day while I was using one plus its just switched off and another day its gave a heavy sound likeboooooooooso plz tell me some suggestionsbrother,

The alert slider saved my lifeI turned on data in class without realizing my phone was on loud and one notification came and the teacher looked my wayi had to do something and thankfully I could switch to silent without looking at it and hence I got away with it thanks for keeping that OP,

So guys the best phone is HTC U11 or OnePlus 5,
all good except your apple sales man Job ,
LG v20 or OP5 which one will you recommend,
One Plus is one of the only companies if not the ONLY company that has the fingerprint reader still on the front and I love that,
533 People who park like that shouldnt be allowed to drive,
hi mkbhd sir good evening do you have any mobiles or cameras for sale,
Is one plus 5 have the same bass effect as one plus one do reply,
Does anybody have the wallpaper on his OnePlus 5 I cant find it anywhere and I want it on my S7 Edge,
only watching on 1plus 1,
Did anyone else hear him at 430 say Bixby when he was talking about copying apple,
For the price isnt it an amazing phone Spec wise,
Link your wallpapers used in the video please,
A sad point is that in every 6 months a new device comes which makes even the new device old one yet isnt that old,
I Got a oneplus 5 rewiew ad before watching a rewiew of The oneplus 5 Oneplus 5ception,
*You didnt talk about one of the most important parts The charging time 30 minutes for 50 is awesomely outrageous*,
Do this allows for 4k video recording ,
One plus are NOT a small or young company,
Playing some Mario kart in the background I see,
I laughed when he said bixby,
can you post the link for the wallpaper,
Bro upload honor 8 pro review,
Holy shit this is leaps and bounds better than the Pixel 2 in terms of feature set while remaining fast and bigger battery 74mm wide though I was looking for something 69mm ,
worst review ive heard so far  this guy doesnt know anything about phone lmao,
Sorry to say it looks a like he wasnt in mood of reviewing or he was trying hard no to say something bad,
8GB RAM so in next year the will be 16GB droidlagg phone D,
Im confused Does he not know that One Plus  Oppo are a part of the same company,
Whatever happened to that modular Kickstarter project,
at the end it sounded like you said dont get one ok so anyway i thought this phone wasnt out yet,
Im watching this on OnePlus 3t,
I think this phone its the best for 2017  i like it as a casual guy,
No way Only Black,
dumb question but what is the icon pack youre using,
How possible it is that you make a video review of the Xiaomi MI 6 Just wondering,
I want the 8gb ram model not 6gb with less ram,
Should I trade my iPad 5 2017 model 32 GB for a OP5 with 8 GB ram and 128 GB space,
Should I buy oneplus x in 2017  or which one Yes Im poor hahaha,
Black and almost blackdoesnt the color have a name,
I should install dat Tesla app on my phone even thought I dont have one,
The phone is amazing,
Bhai log mat lo onepluse mobile phone,

Hello there Sir Great video overall and its very informativeSir I became huge fan of yours and im also a huge fan of oneplus My dream was to buy oneplus but Couldnt afford one I messaged repeatedly on famous youtubers To giveaway the oneplus but none replied Sir I would do anything if you giveaway this smartphone I promise Ill tell each and everyone to view each of your videos and to subscribe your channel Im a college guy and Im studying on student loan In my parents salary i cant imagine to buy a smartphone I would be such a great help if you giveaway this smartphone Hope atleast you reply Im an honest person and i hope you understand my financial condition and my love for smartphones,
Marques what happened to you UR one of mine favorite youtubers but this time around it seems like Poor use of credibility Stick to your roots its better in the long runand yes I uderstand why u did that who is watching tech reviews on youtube right targeted clientele 1 fan base is huge Anyway have a nice day,
I want but doesnt work on Sprint,
Best review Ive seen of this phone so far,
this design has officially grown to mei like this phone now,
Does anyone know if Poetic is creating the revolution again for the one plus 5,
He managed to advertise D brand,
I told my friends at school I was getting ready 15 nobody knew what it was,
Good Review thanks guy,
OnePlus5 should have went for a near bezzleless design The big bezels on the top and bottom is a real turn off Especially when even a budget phone like LG Q6 has a near bezzleless design,
My favorite mobile phone,
when a Phone legit comes with LPDDR4 memory but MacBook Pro 2017 has LPDDR3 lol wattaheck,
Vibrations are stronger if youre into that,
Watching on my OP5,
is cast screen availableMKBHD,
Of all the OnePlus phones which one do you recommend as an upgrade I currently have OnePlus One,
508 GTA 6 Leaked Picture,
I have a OnePlus 3 Im going to wait until OnePlus moves on to new display designs and as soon as they got that huge modern display Im buying that thing As a OnePlus 3 user I dont think the upgrade is needed that much,
Who is here after the launching of oneplus 6,
one plus vs iphn 6s which is betr,
458 I see what you did there ,
433 bixby lolllll savage marques,
Oneplus5 is the best phone on the market hands down For the price and the hardware its a no brainer,
MarquesI dont have so many money to by this phoneand I know that from time to time you are doing giveaways with oneplus phones oneplus 3tbut I havent won evercan you do another giveaway please Thank you,
I did not even know about the extended screenshot mode bruh,
iphone 7  no headphone jack iphone 8  no speaker iphone 9  no ports iphone 10  no buttons iphone 11  no phone Only sell the name,
The iphone 9 will not come with a charge port when the battery dies you buy another iphone,
The iPhone 9 is going to be a piece of paper with a camera taped to it,
iPhone 10 No battery no speakers no screen no buttons Only 3000 dollars Best phone 2018,
iPhone 9 is a calculator,
Ive never heard anyone say I wish my iPhone was thinner I dont understand Apple,
Ill just switch to Android,
AUX adapter 5 Apple iAdapter 500,
you dont see ethernet that much anymore are you joking,
So what am I supposed to do with my 300 beats btw theyre made by Apple too Oh right Buy some 50 adapter Hello Galaxy s7,
Dear Apple I DONT CARE HOW THIN THE PHONE IS I CARE ABOUT FUNCTIONALITY,
iPhone 8 Lets remove the screen,
Today No jack such a dissapointment its bad blah blah When the new iPhone comes out  Brilliant its the way to go what is jack anyway,
The iPhone 8 wont even have the center button It will be all screen based touch jesters and voice controls,
A LOT of people use the Ethernet cable gamers especially,
They should remove the screen takes way more space that 35,
Ive time traveled to see the iPhone 16 Its a piece of paper that needs no charging and if you want to txt or do anything or listen to music you use your imagination,
Headphones through lighting port what Answer this What happens when i want to listen to something with headphones and charge it at the same time,
There are quite a few people here saying that Bluetooth headphones will solve the issue They are probably the same types of people to rip their music from YouTube converter at the lowest possible bitrate and not give a single fuck about audio quality Bluetooth will never sound as good as a wired connection with a dedicated amp And as someone who buys music in FLAC rather than mp3 I refuse to use bluetooth,
my car has an aux cable so how will i impress fine ladies with my fire mixtapes on our way to chipotle buy a bluetooth stereo PREPOSTEROUS,
headphone jacks are really needed for me,
Apple figured out that they can make a fortune selling 69 lightning to headphone jack adapters,
You dont see ethernet You actually use wifi on your desktop,
Thats it for me for iPhone Bluetooth headphones so far are not as good as wired headphones,
iPhone 8 is gunna get rid of the calling feature to save space,
Please my mom just bought me a Iphone 6s plus and im pretty happy for it I could either choose between wait for the Iphone 7 to realease or i could choose the Iphone S6 plus The s6 plus will be the last good phone they made I mean No freaking headphone jack Have to pay 150 for a fucking pair of 5 hour lasting trash earplugs which Apple wont give me in the box that i had to pay 1000 for a phoneThis is a completely downgrade not an upgrade if you ask me,
SO they just announced that they are indeed removing the jack LOLOL Rip iPhone7,
The sad thing is no matter what Apple does people are still going to buy their phones If They make the phone paperthin with no battery people will still buy it just because its an Apple product,
Android phones will get rid of the headphone jack too if Apple does it And where will all the rage be what will all the haters do where are we going to find room to put away all the contradictory comments Theyll say well at least they did it with USBC But thats the same thing the headphone jack is still gone you need new earphones or an adapter and none of your docks will work with USBC Its the saaaaame thing Theres no way competitors are going to NOT copyfollow other successful competitors They all do it to one another Even Apple If I had to bet on it changes are coming and itll take 24 years to get used to this one Its a big one,
Theyll get used to it  Apple 1976  2016,
if they want to fit more in the iphone why would they make it thiner,
What if you got a charging case for the iPhone 7 how would you listen to music,
He said wireless charging and I was like nah then he said waterproof and I was like aw hell naw,
or you can just switch to samsung,
Iphone 10 No phone,
If Apple actually removes the 35mm headphone jack in lieu of the Lightning port then count me out The 30 pin connector was understandable but the 35mm jack is ubiquitous and is far from being obsolete Im not entirely against phasing out the 35 mm jack but it shouldnt be just to make the iPhone thinner especially without focusing on improving battery life which is a bigger issue considering battery tech has stagnated and it shouldnt be with Lightning USB Type C is going to be the universal standard and it would make far more sense Apple has even used USB Type C in the new MacBook and is a fan of the IO Lightning is a limited proprietary connector with known durability issues that hasnt even taken hold among thirdparty battery cases designed for the iPhone its still all Micro USB excluding Apples own battery case,
I dont get what the point of removing the headphone jack is Even if the argument is that theres higher sound fidelity youre still converting to analogue audio *facepalm*,
pretty dumb to get rid of your 6 just to buy a 7,
if all the crap Apple has done since now hasnt convinced me not to get an iPhone this definitely has,
Thats jacked up,
Why dodn apple just sell an empty box for new i phone 8 Then you will have a lot of space in your pocket,
next iphone We brought the 35m jack back we were just testing it out,
Ethernet will never die out WIRED INTERNET MASTER RACE,
the company that brought us the iPod might be the first to get rid of the audio jack BOOM,
shoutout to those cheerios on the back,
IPhone 20  Earth destroyed No IPhone 20 found ,
ill probably never use an android phone but i honestly hate any accessories apple comes out with hardware and software,
I still think it is a really dumb decision yeah the audio jack is extremely old but it works and delivers high quality audio bluetooth is more likely to fail wtf is apple thinking I just may make the switch to Android Apple is like that insane scientist who invented the shrinkray and is trying to make everything small I mean look what happened their phones are bendable for god sake,
You know you have money when you have expensive ass camera lenses just sitting there for decoration,
the funny thing is _you dont have to buy the phone if you dont want it_,
They would have to ship an adapter with the phone imo,
did he just say nobody uses ethernet,
Rip headphone users,
Apple is screwing people when it comes to the aux cord,
I love Apple but if the headphone jack gets removed Im mostly getting the Galaxy S7,
anyone else notice the big box of cheerios in the background,
Apple  Theyll get used to it,
Samsung on the S6 removed the microsd storage and later on the S7 they made it happen again Now apple removes the headphone jack and later they will implement it again calling it revolutionary and new Its called marketing for stupid people,
im from the future It still has 35mm port,
Im still not over them getting rid of the CD player and now this wtf,
We need the headphone jack,
no phone i only,
iPhone 10 will have no display,
Sounds like they trying to sale more Beats by Dre,
iPhone 13 is secretly running Android,
136 its lightning cable,
You got use to it Introducing ihear for 399,
so it means you cant listen to music while its chargingsomeone pls tell me no,
Hey Apple just confirmed that there will be no buttons on the iPhone 10 Crazy time traveller from future XD P,
This is why I refuse to buy Apple products Im fine with being sane thanksmusic is the only thing that keeps me sane at school,
Breaking News The iPhone 7s will be lighter than the iPhone 7 due to the lack of any buttons screen or battery,
Marques Brownlee will be recruited to run a top tech company some say ten years from now WILL SEE good work keep it up its where you going,
Try other side madafaka,
2016 Iphone7 no aux jack 2017 iPhone8 no charger 2018 iPhone9 no screen 2019 nothing just get apple 700,
what do they even need the x space for,
I like this Android guy has the right things to say about apple,
Mkbhd be listening to that logic fire,
Apple is mind controlling us,
If they change the audio jackIm switching to Samsung People who used android and switched to iPhone after the change of charging cable from iPhone 4 to 5didnt have any problem as they didnt have the old iPhone and when Apple did the changesome iPhone users switched to android My class used to have lots of iPhone usersnow theyre almost all android,
008 Can someone give me that wallpaper,
You dont see Ethernet much anymore The heck are you smoking Gigabit Ethernet is still a prolific standard,
Im calling it now iPhone 7 will have no headphone jack The iPhone 7 will come out 23 months later will have a headphone jack and will be identical to the iPhone 7 in every other way However they will sell the 7 for 100200 more because theyre giving you the jack as a feature,
uhh by the way before iPod there were still media players of other brands  which had the audio jack in it,
Well it can be another way to charge your iphone 7Maybe is wireless charging,
You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about Apple killing off all those old technologies but Look around do you actually want a CD drive Design is about prioritizing some featurestechnologies over others Its not that were all suckers nice jab at the OG Apple logo btw its that the compromise yes thats what it is is worth it Apple also makes a MacBook that only has one USB port Theyre doing the right thing even if the transition to the future might sting a little,
this is ridiculous this is apple being tryhard innovative without steve jobs people will not simply get used to it like everything else the headphone jack is the standard from everything casual music to audiophile listening to professional studio music production nobody is gonna want a high priced headset or monitors just to use with stupid iphone,
apple is not making any sacrifice they are making money,
I hate that intro song,
futureJUST WAIT TIL THERES 23 LIGHTINGusbC PORTS TO DO EVERYTHANG,
Dear sir excellent commentary I enjoyed your video Oh and you have a great broadcast voice  pierre from New Mexico,
The moment when Theres no iPhone 7 LMAO How meant like for all the effort this video took to do tho,
That logic on Spotify though,
He was bumping logic Lit,
2018 anyone  just me uhhhhhhhhhhh ok,
Wassup Youre Amazing tenuous languid Whats your opinion about this huys,
The little microphone volume bar is so satisfying to watch,
Aye Its Logic great rapper man,
at 136 he said thunder bolt instead of lightning lol,
Heres some perspective the 11 MacBook still has headphone jack,
Im more than okay with this as long as they make a battery case where theres multiple lightning ports andor an aux jack,
I would want a phone with 2 aux jacks man not with 0,
so What are they doing with this newly acquired space Apple MOAR CAMERA FEATURES,
Moto Z,
Theres le Eco already These guys didnt put audio jack in their current flagships,
iPhone 8  No storage space  only iCloud storage with a paid subscribtion iPhone 9  No volume and power buttons  only force touch buttons on the screen iPhone 12  Only a piece of glass with a metal band around it,
They should sell just the screen The screen will have 10 lightning ports Now the genius part comes in You sell a hundred different adaptors or we to increase functionality CPU bluetooth battery NFC chip etc all sold as addons Advantage our thinnest and lightest phone yet Disadvantage Literally everything,
324 Were lucky its only 10,
I like your intro,
everytime he says classic apple fashion take a drink,
Are those the ATHM50X or the M70s Never seen that colour combo before,
iphone 7s no front camera iphone 8 no power button iphone 8s no speakers external speakers trough lightning port  need adapter  iphone 9 no battery  external one just 199 just 3 mm thin    iphone 20s no phone just 2 apple steaker with rainbow color,
iPhone 8 With no screen your battery will last even longer fu*k you apple,
its cool to see this kind of videos after 11 months cuz u already know what happened D,
Its rubbish if you remove the audio jack,
My old by smartphones standard Lg G4 can open spotify when im plugin my headphones via jack,
LMFAO OH MAN Apples slogan should definitely be Theyll get used to it LOL Great video man,
Apple is going to regret this decision forever believe me the decision to remove the headphone jack will go down in history as one of the worst decisions that apple has ever made,
what if I want to charge my phone and listen to music using earphones at same time a question to debate on,
So u can plug earbuds but not headphones,
People got mad when apple removed the floppy drives in the first iMac but then they got used to it You mean they went to a UNIXwindows based solution that could be modified even to this day to accept floppy drives relatively easily and a new larger crowd of people came in their place,
i still have iphone 4waiting for iphone 20s to come out,
now THATS an excellent closing statement,
for idk _ 50 bucks classic haha,
if the iphone 7 has no headphone jack than this is worse the all the iphones THEY ARE ALL THE SAME,
Dear Apple WE DONT WANT A THINNER PHONE WE WANT MORE BATTERY,
charge your phone and listen to headphones not a good idea MB,
ethernet that much anymore Are you joking Ethernet is literally everywhere,
2016  no jag 2017  no display 2018  no phone just I 2019  no Apple 2020  PEAR  maybe  ,
The difference between this change and the previous ones like getting rid of the floppy disk drive is that the new ports they replaced them with were industry standards like USB whereas the lighting connecter is a proprietary Apple connector So are Apple going to let everyone use Lighting or are we going to forever have two types of audio connecters  Apples one and everyone elses,
Apple Time to bend over Customers  no lube,
Worst tech blunder of 2017 guaranteed,
U said that they removed 30pin and replaced with thunderbolt WHAT With lightning ,
STUNNINJ HEY THJRE LAND INJURE,
my headphone wires dont get in my wayso im fine with my galaxy,
What if they remove the screen for the iPhone 8,
eu ganhei um desse ele timo,
Marques Brownlee YOURE HOT AF,
But Marques didnt you make a video about the Oppo r5 which had no audiojack,
Dont buy an apple product and problem is solved I know I will never buy one ever again,
They are probably trying to make it thinner enough to shove it up theirs,
I think apple time has come to become nokia  shut their shop soon Zero innovation,
He is getting paid by apple recently you can tell he is more soft towards apple than when he started the channelhaha,
Thats a really good album  the logic album that was on his phone,
New pictures confirm that the phones gonna have the 35 mm audio jack after all,
and more room if they want more storage then they should get microsd cards if they want more room but no they just want your money,
I will not be buying a phone without a headphone jack Like aux cords are my favorite things,
imagine the future you cant charge it iPhone thin as paper easier to break,
iPhone 12 will have no power button youll need to keep it charged All The Time,
URL of this video is PIG MONEY,
AH THOSE L AND CINE LENSES 3,
you dont see vga anymore Its over half way through 2017 and brand new moniters still use vga,
It probably doesnt have wires 1 Because its wireless 2 Now earbuds are blue tooth for their new products 3 You can get Bluetooth earbuds yourself 4they still NEED the jack,
the real question is how long will battery life be,
Apple stop This has gone too far First one USB port on your laptops and now this,
android is better than iphonewhy people waste money,
You can easily hide your headphones in class now P,
the box of Cheerios in the background,
What big headphone company would create an entire new line of products with a lightning port that will work perfectly with the new iPhone And thats when Beats come up as the good guys that have your back covered from day 1 with their brand new 200 pair of headphones And thats how you make even more money out of your overpriced smartphone,
Maybe one day iPhone will invent its own built in charger,
overchared phone with an overcharged unecessary inovation ANDROID MASTER RACE FTW,
I love your enthusiasm haha Great response,
shout out to you playing logic P,
Hey this was released on my birthday,
Well guess The next phone Im getting is the Galaxy S7 No headphone jack is a no go for me,
its interesting vidho whats up copy heap whats your opinion abovt it ,
iPhone X10 has no home button Probably iPhone 11 wont have Volume buttons Probably iPhone 12 wont have an off button Probably iPhone 13 wont have a screen Probably iPhone 14 wont have a phone,
Heres a proper solution drop both lightning and the headphone jack switch to USBC Its a standard and can transfer audio as well,
People Apple doesnt innovate anymore Apple ok we will take out the headphone jack since its antiquated People forcing me to buy headphones Or your adapter Rabble rabble rabble,
ipod has only one port  to charge sync music and plug headphones its perfect  not 2 sides simetric  its 360 degrees simetric apple just removed wrong port,
Bluetooth baby I havent used an audio jack in years Every set of headphones I have are wireless Welcome to the 21st century old timers,
i phone 8 with no screen,
so I guess charging your phone while listening to music with headphones wont be a thing anymore,
lol opening music app because digital headphone jack my android already does that with 35mm jack,
What background do you use on the desktop,
Wait wait wait did you just say no one uses Ethernet anymore huh huh huh cracked,
Apple has its quality I never wish to have an iPhone before because I prefer to use android phone but when I have used iPhone I was satisfied and it continues satisfying me because of the quality and its performance,
Why am I watching this I have a flip phone,
Oppo R1World Slimmest Mobile also doesnt have the Audio Jack,
they shoudl focus on dropping the 16gb base and make the base 32gb 16gb just isnt enough and icould is stupid,
How to get headphone jack Step 1 Throw Iphone out window Step 2 Buy S8 Step 3 Profit,
I still use auxiliary I still use optical drive For Apple Out there Ill not get used to it,
why do they care about thinness that muchi personally dislike too thin phone cuz it isnt that comfortable to hold,
what if they give you the adapter with the pack,
love the intro,
There is a vid of sonitdac nojack bluetooth,
They should have 2 lighting ports,
Ethernet Im sure you mean dialup internet jack right,
iphone 100 glass pure glass XD,
So I need an adapter for my 2 month old Beats Studios 20 Which is also an Apple product FML,
Now I remember the old phones which had a unique headphonecharger port I think that Apple hates universal connectivity they probably want their devices to utilize those portscablesOperating Systems etc that CANNOT be used with NonApple devices Good Ill stay with NonApple devices You know this reeks of Corporate Imperialism instead of focus on benefit of the consumer But maybe its too early to judge well see,
The only reason I complained about this change was about how the 35 mm headphone jack is because it was used universally,
RIP Headphone jack 00000002016,
Apples New Slogan Theyll get used to it,
319 lol,
Lol I dunno how apple fanboys deal with constantly different proprietary chargers One big reason why the internet is so massive and servers are so easy to operate is because of manufacturers standards Every ethernet cable is the same every usb is the same every parallel connector is the same and each one of those has a specific function If every company were like Apple every country youd go would have different types of connectors hundreds of them performing the same task on different devices If a certain manufacturer tanked in a recession every local business would have to swap out their equipment and cabling Proprietary hardware kills progress for short term marginal profit Standardized equipment converges technology and benefits every single company even companies in different sectors Thats just one of the reasons why I think Apple is shit,
In the future there wont even be phones something else instead People will get mad but they will get used to it,
Dont iOS devices use a Lightening cable Not thunderbolt,
Random Fact Guy is here The term Its all fun and games until someone loses an eye is from Ancient Rome The only rule during wrestling matches was no eye gouging Everything else was fair play Goodbye,
I feel iPhone 7 will b having a different type of audio jack But it will have for sure because you cant imagine any phone without music,
Strongly reccomend samsung galaxy s 7 edge,
may i know ur com backgroundits nice,
Why iphone gotta be like thatthink imma switch soon they keep switching after i INVEST in all the accessories,
Dont see Ethernet much anymore What are you talking about Try buying a router or modem without oneit would be difficult,
moto z already got rid of the audio jack,
so this is the start of when he used the all time favorite Ongoing Thing intro He used it in his senheiser hd820 vid D,
if apple was truly as innovative as people claim couldnt they find a way to scale down the port and the connector like a mini plug and could make a 10 converter versus 50,
Im so glad I switched over to Android,
Line up and bend over people Oh and make sure you bring cash Sincerely Apple,
i december i will buy 6s not 7 cause i want 7s,
Do Xiaomi mi5 review,
Theyll get used to it lol,
so do i have to get airpodsor like beats orraycons *thinks in head what mom will say* Mom HAHAHAHAHAHAH AIRPODS DO YOU PAY BILLS HHAAHAHAHA No Get the hell out my face *thinks what mom will say about beats* mom *She looks around the house* me mom what are you doing mom TRYING TO FIND WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO *Thinks about what shell say about raycons* Me what about these mom their only 70 Mom Ask your dad *asks dad* Dad ask your mom me *FLIPS TABLE* APPLE WHYYYY,
Ok guys I just got the news that iPhone 8 wont have display to make it thinner,
YOU LISTEN TO LOGIC MY HOMIE,
How about beats wireless headphones,
yea yea i know the story jack is gone rose Is left well apple good job reminding us about the saddest movie Ever,
Audio jack was the only slot left on Apple phones that you didnt have to buy official apple products to use thats why its gone next theyll invent own sim cards,
my Sony z2 can do everything you just said the lightning port can do,
Cheerios in the background,
Lmao this actually ended up being true,
well Im sticking to android,
Yeah Apple have removed stuff before but this is the AUDIO JACK Its not the same as other standards Sure Apply removed the floppy drive but that was because CDs were simply better and they removed the CD drive but that was because digital downloads are simply better 30pin connecter was too simply inferior to the Lightning cable Theres no better solution for audio What bluetooth There arent enough of them around and theyre ridiculously expensive And using the lightning port brings up the new MacBooks 1 USBC problem its not practical Apple has only ever removed things when there was an alternative that was superior in pretty much every way in order to speed up the adoption of the better format There isnt a better format for audio jacks,
this guy must be a apple fanboy because the note 7 has way more in it and still has a 35 and no steav to save them this time lmao,
Heres a brilliant idea just keep the phone you have if it works well lol,
this seemed crazy a couple months ago,
Yes my man listens to logic,
yeah im going to have a good time not buying the iphone 7,
Very late but really I havent used a headphone jack for years bluetooth aint dat expensive Even if u cant afford wireless well u clearly can cuz u spent over 500 on a phone,
Apple is the definition of I brought you in so I can take you out,
Just thinking about what Steve Jobs wouldve done,
I was glad when Apple went from the 30 pin to the Lightning port It was much needed,
apple products have been trash since Steve died,
can we remove the speakers or atleast make them like one hole instead of like 8 and make the phone have two lighting connectors one on top and bottom for charging either way or for charging and listening,
It has no headphone jack because it comes with Bluetooth ear buds,
I dont think they did it because of space Imho it has more to do with wanting to do it water restistant Remove one more hole where water could enter,
the damn iPhone 19 is going to be a chip and taped to a drywall,
Yeah Ill just stick to their iPods for now,
People will get use to it No its more like People will get android If I got an iPhone id sit there and ponder the question for a day or 2 before opening it on if I should sell it and get an android phone chances are I would,
whats that background called,
Remember when Apple started robbing usthen we got use to it,
they took away the headphone jack because the iPhone 7 cones with Bluetooth earbuds from beats,
What if iPhone 7 comes with a bluetooth Earpods Its possible,
MKBHDs iPhone 7 MOTO is Theyll get used to it,
i agree that iphone 7 maybe should be a bit thicker for other useful things,
how the heck does he upload such quality all my videos got squished and compressed by YT to no end,
On the iPhone 9 we decided to take a different more innovative approach on the camera We removed it entirely to make iPhone 9 extremely thin Dont worry we will be selling a camera that will plug into the lightning port This new innovation will allow us to make the best iPhone camera to date,
maybe Bluetooth,
Theyre probably pushing for bluetooth headphones,
Oppo r5,
you could make a rap out of then we got used to it 3 3,
Whats next No power button,
is that a skin for your headphones or are they custom made,
Well looks like Im switching to a galaxy,
What mobile brand fly like And what phone youre using now iPhone 6 s or S7 edge or regular S7,
The first video with that iconic 20syl  Ongoing Thing intro,
now were in 2018 and theirs basically no flagships left with one unfortunately,
very well said man,
I sold crack out the window like Jack in the Box Lil B,
Less features twice as expensive typical Apple,
Im sorry but all the possible benefits you mentioned from using headphones through the lightning port are all possible with the 35mm jack My phone has digital noise cancellation build in and the phone recognizes when you plug in a certain type of headphonesearplugs and you can setup what you want to happen when you do plug them in open a music app change the volume turn the noise cancelling on or off etc The number 1 reason why Apple would want to get rid off the 35mm jack and use the lightning port is very simple money and market share 3 times guess who makes headphones with lightning cables Yes Beats which is owned by Apple They are not the only ones to make them and there are much better brands out there but they make them They just want to promote and sell more Beats headphones slap another 50 bucks onto the price and say that they are designed for iPhones Nothing points to the fact that Apple would do it to save space If space for lets say a bigger battery would be such an issue why are they making their phones thinner all the time The idea you mentioned at the end of what your perfect new iPhone would be is what I think the majority of phonetech enthousiast want Sadly 90 of people buying iPhones are far from tech savvy and mostly only buy it because of the name,
Amen but with a headphone jack,
I agree with you with everything,
*lightning not thunderbolt,
heres an idea wireless headphones,
iPhone 8 no battery iPhone 9 no buttons iPhone 10 no screen iPhone 11 its invisible,
i come from the future it doesnt have a headphone jack,
Yea use a fragile lightning port for the headphone and it wont make it more expensive,
OR there can be two lightning ports,
Well whatever apple does their brainwashed fanboys will buy the new phone,
5se specification pls,
if its true its gonna be a problem for apple iphone market,
and the ADAPTER,
Guys I work at an Apple Store The next iPhone isnt going to have a screen a homebutton speakers or ANYTHING Its also going to be red round and have an antennae,
So what happens if my expensive wireless Beats headphones blow out I wont be able to just buy a cheap pair from Walmart anymore,
Nice clickbait mate,
At least I have Bluetooth headphones 3,
Firewire is still around with pro audio hardware,
If this turns out to be true Im sticking with my 6S,
iPhone 10 is going to be a tv remote,
remember everyone going to Bluetooth headphones so that the next step it seem logical to delete the headphones jack,
The new intro is nice,
Many many very powerful phones have an headphone jack And those phones are not handicapped in any way by the huge headphone jack,
And to think I have the Iphone Forever Plan,
Thats dumb if Apple takes away the headphone jack then it wont be open for other Apple Products so removing the Headphone jack is a Myth,
why not have the charger in the audo jack ,
Your last line is really something to think about,
Something else to charge You have to turn off listening to get two hours battery life from there 400 headphones,
I Phone 10 has no screen You have to hook it up to a 1000 apple screen,
Logic y,
Apple got tired about seeing so many memes about tangled headphones now you want the headphones,
off topic but aye 20syl,
If this is true Im going android,
If it does use lightning for headphones there needs to be an adapter that allows you to charge it while you use them,
they are gunna say  you need to get the headphone jack in a very rare supply drop,
you dont see Ethernet that much anymorewhat,
239 You could have minor things like the music app opening when your headphones plug in Yeah that works on Android with the 35 mm port,
What the intro song called Plz,
I was planning on getting one but lucky I did some research on this and found out theres NO HEADPHONE JACK Possibly RIDICULOUS I cant live without that shit,
You can also not buy the iPhone 7 I dunno,
hes lit with that logic playing,
4GB RAM Can we just take a minute to appreciate this please people,
So if you work as a security guard at the Samsung store does that make you guardian of the galaxy,
Ive only had iPhones Ive had the 6 since its release but its fucking up think Im switching to the s7 edge,
The only thing Apple has over Android is certain apps *cough* Snapchat *cough* being completely optimized for Apple,
Now that the phone is water proof I can use it in the shower,
Im not really feeling that edge model  I prefer the smaller vanilla s7 which imo looks just as sexy especially in black onyx,
Samsung has discovered more galaxies than even NASA LoL,
that tiny speaker is actually loud af,
bruh im just waiting on android to copy iMessage and im switching for good,
SD820 Bigger Battery Micro sd Super new camera WATER RESISTANT Welcome back Samsung i miss you,
Damn now I regret getting an iPhone 6s ,

still have my note 3 but since I dont even use the spen except for scratching my balls im going to buy this phone,
worlds best smartphone fantastic,
I just got mine s7 edge its Wow what a display brilliant just perfect and battery i have use from 930 am to 1100 pm and i had still 30 using all the day its just perfect i prefer to all of you,
They took away the ir blaster wtf My phone is the only remote i have for my tv lol,

Bigger battery Smaller camera bump Micro sd card Welcome back Samsung,

Both Samsung s7 and s7 edge are water proof right,
WASSUP GETTING BETTER ALL THE WIME KITTENS SEPARATE WHAT DO YOU THINK GWYS ,
Dyou guys realize that the first Galaxy S was released only 6 years ago Damn time and technology goes faaast,
Id rather have a galaxy s7 than an iPhone honestly,
Holy shit I havent been paying attention to technology in general much since the S5,
I have always loved to buy the Samsung Galaxy S phones and one of the main attractions was not just the removable battery but also the option of additional storage via SD card slot I dont know why the reviewers always seem to make a fuss about the plastic feel of the phone it never bothered me in fact I prefer it because it made the phone stand out in a positive way in my mind because you could remove and load up a fresh battery to get you through the day Why some people think that the Galaxy phone is trying to look like the iPhone is a bit of mystery to me but if that is what Samsung was aiming for I would certainly be disappointed because as far as Im concerned the iPhone has more hype and the Samsung more value for money but both devices are equal in terms of performance and usability its just a matter of choice So in short I would have already purchased an S6 or S6 Edge buy now but Im holding off because of my concerns about battery life and the lack of external storage Im seriously thinking of going for one of the Chinese phones eg Meizu that may not have the desired options of battery and storage but are a lot cheaper with excellent performance,
 I likg it festive separate Whats happening 1,
Bigger battery Bigger explosion,
I Have Galaxy S5 but Goddamn I need to get This phone S6 was a meeeh but this is the perfect phone,
Hay man just wanted you to know that I always watch your videos before I buy any smart phone and Ive seen most of your videos multiple times and most of all your videos just for fun keep up the good work,

DAMN SAMSUNG BACK AT AGAIN WITH THE MICRO SD CARD SLOT,
THAT INTRO  AEY WHAT IZZ UP GUYS P,
the edge looks sexy and the classic s7 looks trash HAHAHAHA funnys7,
This is what the S6 shouldve been They have pretty much just re added features,
He is dead on about the speakers I very rarely listen to media without headphones but it was noticeable coming from a 6p,
so no 3D touch,
Could you please review the LG G5 next Thanks ,
how did you get your intro did someone make it for you,
Great phone and all but wow amazing quality video of the review not the phone lol Mind telling me what camera you used,
Sitting here in my room with an alcatel one touch 2 wishing that one day i can buy the s7 edge ahhh only i can dream ,
Samsung actually listened to their users 0,
I Still have my note 3 but seeing the amazing things Samsung are doing with the new phones Im just impressed if the note 6 is waterproof dustproof has expandable memory beautiful more improved metal design and more features for the finger print scanner then Im 100 upgrading my note 3 is amazing but these new phones are something else,
No USBC No Samsung this year then Big mistake Samsung big mistake,
Ok so I have a question I usually buy a new battery for my phone every year as it gets really bad after approx 1214 months in my opinion My Note 4 for example would drain superfast from maybe 4020 and then just shut off somewhere below 20 What do you do when this batter becomes a hassle,
marques I know this question of mine is off topic but yet What is the name of the wearable that ur wearing on ur hand ,
How to start an Internet fight 1  Apple  Samsung 2  wait,
Bropls give me some advice should I go for galaxy s7 edge  or wait for the iPhone 7,
Nothing much A new dual pixels camera two features come back  sd card water resistant not a very big forward stepped processor Done,
I have seen some cool shit but this is just incredible,
i have this phone woo hoo broke my gold one first day lol but samsung replaced mine free of charge  dont drop it,
Imagine yourself watching this video 5 years ago Just think about some of the specs this phone has and the way he talks about them What a world we live in,
The S7 in the thumbnail looks a little bendy dont you think,
In 2036 Apple will release iphone curve and boy will it be a Big deal or what,
when u put it in a case on day 1fingerprints dont matterever,
Thats why i like your video Marque simple and clean,
thats very kine heyyo correct collect what do you thino ,
You have bug eyes Theyre destroying the whole town Let it playone more time,
is there a real benefit functionally with the edge line up,
Watching this on the S7 edge Its incredible,
A little birdie told me this phone can handle all the tears of joy i will be shedding once i get my hands on it,
galaxy s7 has so many pixels its insane,
Im surprised you didnt explode half way through the vid,
hey yo please do unboxing of lg g5 thank you,
8 months old and still the best phone overall Pixel is meh iPhone 7 is meh And RIP NOTE 7,
Its a crime watching one of Marques videos in 360p,
first i thought ur hands were dirty and that u shouldve cleaned them off before doing the video but then i saw u were black xD,
I really like s7 edge because of design Amoled displaywater and dust resistance always on display and the camera performace and other,
S7 Edge or BMW e36,
Too bad US version does not come with exynos It is way better than snapdragon,
Thought you killed the 360p club,
what is diferency btw regular and edge How it cost,
Theres no escaping from the Samsungs Look oh so sad,
that auto focus but still not better that v10,
Dope video Fam Thanks,
My friend and I have been using Iphones but he switched to the s7 Im jealous because it looks like an awesome phone but the 6s still works I guess,
Just got mine today I boxing check every thing I think the quality of packages is low and I found it made from Vietnamese I am very disappointed,
Are the iPhones water resistant Thats something Im impressed with with this phone,
the question is is it better than edge 6 for the virtual reality Im talking about the resolution,
Sold my LG G4 got an iPhone 6S now thinking to send it back and getting this,
great review very knowledgeable I usually dont care about phones but Ill buy this one,
Amazon thing it support fast wireless chargingand newisdom fast wireless charger fits it so wellwhich can be avaible on amazon,

loving how they bring back rhe SD card slot,
Worth every single penny Ive had it since its release and Im still amazed as to how fantastic this phone is,
Geez the IR blaster was actually one of the major selling points for me,
Kudos to Sammy for listening to us and adding a SD card and big battery,
My S7 edge panels arent enabled How do I enable them,

meanwhile nexus 5x 306  on ebay should i get it ,
Ill be keeping my s6 until they include the ir blaster again  Really dissapointed,
Intro music so wavy,
I am a note 5 userand I decided to try the s7 edge WOW I LOVE the Edge The best phone Ive ever used Stunning phone good by note 5,
If only an iPhone had these specs number 1 phone by far,
If the S7 had a removable battery and front facing speakers then it would be the ultimate phone,
Damn galaxy 7 already and Im watching this with my s4,
I miss the old intro,
Samsung brought back features that they ditched a couple of years ago TRULY ORIGINAL AND AMAZING thats sarcasm btw,
MKBSD not HD,
Nexus 6p for the WIN No android phone beats it yet,
Heya Its really interesting Vifeo fire show Whats your opinion about this,
Id rather replace my newly broken s4 with another s4 than to downgrade to no ir blaster removable battery and voluntarily giving my fingerprints away,
No edge plus or other weird naming LOL,
Wow that crispy 360p,
Damn over 3 million subs Keep it up,
324 asn bayraklar,

720p then it skips to 4k Even though I have a 1080p display Im going to watch it in 4k,
Hi what do you use for record your movies ,
Perfect phones for me since I dont know how many times I dropped my phone in the toilet,

Still error and unfortunetly stopped crashed,
This is what the S6 should have been last year,

Press 1 and sing Calm and ready,
I planning to change my Lumia to Upgrade S7 edge,
I just got my galaxy s7 and I want to test out that water resistant ability but Im scared LOL,
*For those complaining about 360p you should know by now that its your punishment for being early*,

I must admit Ive still got my Note 3 it still a great phone However I will defo upgrade to the S7 ,
my s7 ships on the 11th i had the 6s edge but i went no edge this time because you drop the edge and the first thing to hit the ground is the glass because it pops out,
Last wik I bought s7 edge and Im really love it,
intro song,
haha your hands give ppl a wrong idea of the size of those phones They are MUCH bigger your hands are huge  anyways nice review I really like these s7s 3,
Thicker phone for a larger battery I aint even mad Take notes Apple,
Getting The S7 Tomorrow In Silver Titanium Cant Wait,
damn can i enjoy my s6 edge plus i just got this 5 or 4 months ago geez,
s7 edge or htc m10,
Does any 1 of them have the split screen or multi view,
No IR Blaster Samsung why,
thanks for your review Excellent Was going nuts trying to decide whether to get an S6S6edgeS6edgeplusS7S7edge,
I want a new phone Im Still stuck with a HTC one m8 lol so old,
I really wanted to buy this phone Im still on S5 but no removable battery  I replaced the S5 battery twice now This is a disappointment,
i think this will be a good replacement for my s5 i held back on the s6 specifically for the features they brought back this year,
Nice Waterproof is great Im trying to be like you a awesome youtuber Im almost at 11k so its gonna take for ever lol,
whats the intro,
will anybody help me my samsung galaxy s7 edge will turn off when I try to open insta snap pictures on instagram I tried to uninstall instgram to restore my phone but still wont work I dont understand it,
just a sony user passed by on the crowd of the comment,
I got the SAMSUNG GALAXY MEGA HERE BUT IM STILL DESIRING TO PURCHASE THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE DERANGLY SPLENDIFEROUS,
360p  The struggles,
iPhone  being in jail Forever with 10 million and cant go nowhere Samsung  middle class and free to do any thing but not rich Which one would you chose,
any idea when the full review will be out  cant wait ,
got mine yesterdayI wasnt really impressed Should have saved my money and kept my old cracked s5 ,
Im not a fan of the S7 even remotely They literally just improved the S5 and everyone forgot that this shouldve been the S6 Seriously guys cmon dont praise Samsung for what they shouldve done instead of doing a marketing stunt by taking away their best features in the S6 and putting it in the S7 then every gets praise,
Do a video of what cell phone is better if the Samsung s7 or the LG G5,
Man its crazy how outdated it looks only 2yrs later,
Is the finger print magnet that big of a deal,
Is the Galaxy s7 edge water proof as well,
Is it me or does the S7 black look kinda cheapish,
This fone is a Bomb Im currently using LG Spirit LTE wuz with me,
Still think Nexus 6P is still better just for the speaker and USB C type,
it seems their touchscreen technology hasnt changed much 336,
Note 4 all the way,
any difference between s7 and the s7 edge in terms on specs,
I actually using s7 i dont want s7 edge because its too thin and slippier than normal s7 im worrying if i dropped it,
Looking forward to own one ,
I cant put my s7 edge down Eva since I got it been using it all the time mines premium gold colour,
Here when its 360p _ Lyf is hard,
switching from iphone 6 to sg7 edge,
Should I upgrade from Note 3 to S7 Edge,
HEY MKBHD could you please tell me which is that opening soundtrack which is in all the videos from this year,
Hey You Made It Haqpen different dry What do you think guys0,
As much as Ive criticise Samsung over the years this phone looks like the real deal In fact this seems to be the only step forward Samsung made from the S4 because S5 and S6 have been atrocious Now lets see how Apple go up against this beast of a phone in September,
but no remote control I need one phone with remote control,
Got the s7 in black Im going to get the s7 edge in silver just to have it as well Love my s7 though,
axon 7 is better specs and cheaper,
am getting this for sure I love it,
Just Got yourself A new Subscriber ,
Whaaat No IR Blaster that was the biggest reason I wanted to buy it c,
went you go to show us the LG G5 I make my decision but I want to suported with your opinion hahahaha,
ask us any questions about the new s7 or s7 edge  accessories included,
Here early before it goes viral,
I got the S7 a few days ago andIM IN LOVE I was an Apple user before and I can say that Im definitely not switching back to thembecause to me this is the best phone so far it offers everything I need and the battery life of course is at very good level Dont hesitate to buy it,
hi hows it goinl its sonice rightful dress 11,
Eu tenho um ,
How long does the battery life last Also is it heavy,
Notification crew,
SAMSUNG MEMANG INOFATIF DAN PRODUKTIF,
but the blue looked so good,
Marques Brownlee Apple hater,
I am concerned about screen burn in issues when you enable the always on display since the amoleds are prone to screen burn ins,
S7 litter I love iphone only iphone,
would buy this if it had imessage,
slightly better and polished version of the s6 Phone companies are ridiculous pushing slightly upgraded shit on us every 6 months,
the intro song please,
Doesnt the intro remind you guys of Vevo p,
Ill just stick with my note 4 its still a powerful phone all these phones now are just adding more RAM and more powerful processors but stuff you use a phone for doesnt need all that power yet,
I still have an S3 so this should be more than a slight upgrade for me,
When can we expect the full review,
Can you please do a giveaway of the S7 edge  Black,
one thing I noticed is that when you touch the screen the back and recent apps buttons at the bottom edges dont light up which is nice and you mentioned how you didnt like it in the s6,
Soootheyre saying i can shower with it now and watch videos Winner,
and here i am  stuck with the samsung s3,
did the camera bump realy get reduced or did they just make the phone thicker making it look smaller the vivo xplay 5  s7,
why have they reduced the ppi from 577 to under 540 on the edge,
Im still getting an iPod touch,
I was sure he was talking about the 7 or the Edge,
marques brownlee mate  can you do a comparison video of Audio quality with standard apple earphone between S7 edge vs 6s iphone thanks,
People really forget the iPhone 4 with glass backs,
I dont actually mind the notch it looks good to me,
Apple weve upgraded everything Including the price tag,
The notch makes the iPhone have an iconic look,
Be cool if they made the apple logo on the back actually do something like be a finger print reader,
Youtube recommendations Iphone X review Bank balance recommendation iphone 4s clone,
2017 Two years gone *_Puff_*,
Watching this on my new iPhone X,
No headphone jack   welcome to 2017 I wish ppl would stop using this line of reasoning Its just not true The majority of ppl still use wired headphones or buds Thats just a fact,
Classic Apple * aggressive eye twitching *,
i kinda like the notch tbh i think the notch completed the whole design of the phone make it a signature look for phone itself,
1303 lol the truck driver was waving his hands,
He said good job Samsung because he is referring to the OLED display that Samsung made,
Now Im starting to wish I had this phone When it first came out I was like meh and only liked the sound of the Animoji but since I had and iPhone 6 then went down to 5s I really want this phone,
i like the notch it doesnt bother me at all i love the look of it it never gets in the way of anything you need to see,
No matter how many times I see this I cant afford it ,
lol no need to review the iphone its literaly the same phone they made for 10 years now,
I actually kinda like the notch Now hear me out I know there are better solutions out there but think about it Weve had the same design language for years Its pretty cool to have a refresh,
I love how everyone laughs at apple removing stuff Apple removes headphone jack Other companies do it too Apple has a notch on the X Everyone laughs but then look at huawai and other companies If they wouldnt have made the notch everyone would complain that it looks like a samsung smh,
What kind of review is this The best,
Can you give me 1 please,
 A Doctor a Day keeps the Apple away ,
I Phone X pensive,
1008 Why would I need a flashlight if its really bright out,
But its Apple they are stubborn youll get used to it,
Why do I always end up watching unboxing videos after I Alrd bought the product,
For those of you wanting this wallpaper *Google search this Small Memory HD 4K wallpaper*,

I just wish it wasnt 1000 POOR PEOPLE CAN RELATE ,
That Tesla looks AMAZING omg,
There is no headphone jack welcome to 2017 what a nonargument wow,
WHY IS EVERYONE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FREAKING CAMERA HUMP YOURE GOING TO GET A FREAKING CASE ANYWAY AND IF NOT YOU ARE A MORON Sorry had to let that out,
Im broke tho bruh smh,
This guy rocks,
I like the notch because I imagine it as a S8 bezel but it is been cut so yea the notch is smaller bezel,
I dont know why but I like the notch,
Okay Marques turned the iPhone X commercial into a hoodie Now thats awesome,
I wish I had an IPhone X,
Thanks Marques m Youre my favourite reviewer on YouTube Always killer content ,
Stand by time is best on iphone is the best because it doesnt have always on display,
this phone is top notch,
How to sum up all reviews ever Personal preference Stop fighting over a phone ,
Bad investment when your phone cost more than your laptop then its no longer supported after 2 years or they slow it down so you have to buy another one,
iPhone X  AirPods  A sensational combination and experience,
Tim Cooks scene is so stunning It almost killed me laughing,
Thanks for the tip on swiping up and right to open the apps panel quicker D,
The Tim Cook scene got me laughing,
They should put finger print reader inside the screen next time Face id is lame,
Hey Marques could u do a xr vs x review  im struggling to decide between them thanks and appreciate it ,
Can you please share the wallpaper you had on your iPhoneI like it,
That shade though good job Samsung,
Is it worth the kidney,
Amazing as always Btw 053 love the sweatshirt,
Bro bro You are paying 400 poundsdollars more For the plus I dont think i want to pay that for about 3 inch bigger,
I need advice should i get this or 8 plus pros and cons,
i love my iphonex it is amazing,
Am I the only one who loves watching reviews about new phones but never ever buy one,
600 that is absolutely genius,
Someone can tell me how to find the wallpaper that hes using I love it,

you look like marcus holloway from ubisofts watch dogs 2,
best smart phone,
Great review Marques The video was crystal clear too,
Awesome video You are by far my favorite reviewer man Keep up the good work Marquis,
Im pretty sure if Steve Jobs was still alive the iPhone would have look very different,
Sounds like an honest fair review from someone who gets it that Apple has it flaws,
sir you are making reviews on Bezel less phone for monthsY dont you make a review on OPPO F5 requested highly,
OMFG I HAD A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER THAT WAS LIKE 70 AND HAD AN IPHONE X AND HE WAS LIKE I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS SOMEBODY GIFTED I TO ME AS LONG AS IT TAKES PICTURES AND MAKES CALLS IM FINE,
Samsung is stupid They made better screen on iPhone than on their products,
Great screen Good Job Samsung,
Got mine and just love it One Plus 5T is fast but there is security and pleasure offered by Apple,
Thanks to you I know I definitely do not want this phone I was curious about it only due to animogi thing but nope Not my phone haha,
The iPhone XR is wayyyy to expensive Plus its way to big Its not worth it,
Does this come with AirPods I need to know before aug 16 2018,
This is probably the best video Ive watched in years The quality that went into this video is insane and its easy to understand Thank you MKBHD,
3 The IPhone X And That Sweater Is DOPE,
Speaking of tesla why do you even have the app you dont have a Tesla you know you have a 1990 Honda accord,
I believe if they are increasing the power button size Then there is a good chance of including Finger Print Sensor under the power button Any thoughts,
Best review on a phone and Ive watched many keep it up,
Apple calls it Super retina display but I just call it first oled display ever on Apple device,
No headphone jack welcome to 2017 Im sorry bro but 2017 is still using headphone jack Apple just got greedy and wants to make more profit thats all ,
Theres no headphone jack welcome to 2017 No Nuhuh No welcome to 2017 More Welcome to Apple ladies and gentleman,
also bless ur soul for linking that wallpaper like wow,
I like the review With that being said I do wish the whole its 2017 thing was constantly used as a cop out,
Finally Apple started making top notch phone ,
This made me laugh but when he said unibrow i started laughing bc my crush has a unibrow no offence to anyone with a unibrow,
why dont they have both face and touch id and use the apple logo instead of the home button,
*watches video in 2017 240 oh yeah that looks cool id love to see that case review soon *watches video in november 2018 well shit,
Its so beautiful OMG I hope my credits good enough to finance it wish me luck ,
The production quality on this video is insane Huge props,
Well done Marques Very informative Love my iPhone X btw,
My boyfriend got me an iphone x,
Still remember your first videos doing reviews about Laptop Media Centers remote using your laptop camera And now you here doing the most amazing reviews bro Keep it up carnal,
Nice review I got the phone,
Good job Samsung Rofl,
Watching on the xs,
I know X Plus gonna be lit later this year rumored 65 inch display biggest phone yet and will be amazing despite the notch,
Thank you for doing this video Though its 2019 my mom is getting me the IphoneX tomorrow wich will be my first phone and so I dont know what to expect so thank you,
Best speakers on any phone,
Lets be honest The other iPhone X reviews were good but we all waited for this one,
Theres equal and better phones for less than 1000,
Publicerades den 14 nov 2017  outdated out of date obsolete,
There is no headphone jack welcome to 2017,
Was going to get it but still doesnt have a headphone jack,
When two elephants fight it is the grass that suffers most,
859 Touch ID is faster than Face ID,
Watching this late 2018 makes me laugh cause now pretty much every other high end phone has a notch except for Samsung of course,
I need to switch to Apple Side note Youre a cutie,
Apple please make the Notch on the iPhone X 2018 smaller and narrower to save even more space on the front display,
How do u get your wallpaper please reply ASAP,
ThNk you for making this video It helped me a lot in deciding if I should get the iPhone X,
Where can i get that incredible wallpaper,
I left android for the new iPhone X Best phone I have ever owned Way easy to use with intuitive interface Please dont change this phone Apple,
Ill take that hoodie instead,
Hey Where do you get ur wallpapers from,
Iphone X one of the best looking phones hands down I may like my S8 more but the Iphone X looks Godly,
had sub after this vid bro,
Apple should hire you to market their devices So good,
707 good job SAMSUNGOh yah,
Yo my friend lives in the building next to you,
I was my wallpaper last month like your iphone x,
Apple Ha we can make an ugly bezel Google HOLD MY BEER,
Am I the only one who actually really likes how the notch looks,
iPhone X is the best smartphone ever made until now Accept that,
I think Xiaomi copies design from what Apple does ,

Good job Samsungdid u just say that lol,
I love the way you explain Awesome as always,
I am writing this from a iPhone 10 after a week of use as my daily driver So Im coming off the google pixel for the last year And before that I was iPhone 3g4 5 5s and 6 I hate how you big reviewers dont flat out call out apple and other companies when they are on bull shit The pixel had the pip for YouTube where I can keep the video going while doing other things on the phone They didnt put the usb c on this phone for but its on the iPad and MacBooks Wtf u have to pay 90 to get apple rapid charging cables and box Who gives a fuck about the notches Its 1000 and doesnt come with AirPods but the galaxy 10 is coming with free buds on pre order They still havent dropped the apple air power wireless charging and google pixel 3 has the charging stand for 70 and I bet air power will be upwards of 150 Yall always talk about screen time right out the box brand new But we all know screen time matters after a year of use and going through the software upgrades and then noticing your battery life is shit all of a sudden after that new software upgrade So fuck screen time right out the box we all know its gonna be good And yall never call out this company for implementing things in their phones that have already been done by Samsung and others And then apple passes these old features off as new and innovative Most of you big reviewers are getting free stuff from the companies so yall wont keep it real and 100 And the god damn air pods dont have wireless charging that Im sure they could have easily added but wanted to keep people in the market for the AirPods 2 and charge 200 No volume control on the air pods either All this is shit that should be on this phone for 1000 Yall never speak on this shit But like I said yall dont want to stop getting invited to the press releases and getting the free stuff and the fame that comes with being a big tech reviewer Cause if Yall didnt care you guys would call out bullshit The phone isnt that bad but for 1000 it could have been a lot better,
I want this phone now i just need some more money i have a plan on how I could do this we need to rob the Samsung store If it has any money,
Hahah You were like Good job Samsung Good review,
I always wanted this phone but i never gotten a phone,

Now its April 2018 its a little bit cheaper  is it really worth to buy it now,
1000 for phone with a notch no headphone jack no forward facing speakers blue sheen on screen no fingerprint scanner no thanks Top selling point emojis,
i find it funny seeing Android and Apple fanboys fight in the comments Imma just be honest and say the iPhone X great phone with great features and the S8 is a great phone with great features It all just comes down to personal preference,
How the speakers  R they stereo sound as iPhone 7 Plus ,
*Watches with Android wishing they would get an iPhone on Christmas*12162018,
watching and feeling poor as helll on a Galaxy J3 Grand Prime,
Hey Marquesu r da best unboxer in world Whenever a new phone launches I watch ur and geekyranjits videoI was wondering that you guys would be having so many phones Cant you give ur this fan one iPhone Xjust one phone,
The notch is like your nose  You always see it but get used to it  I bet it bothers you now,
I like the wallpaper on your phone Oh and its in the description which I see as I am typing lol,
MKBHD you CAN group notifications in iOS dig deeper,
Im not in camp 1 or 2 I notice the notch and love the design For some reason ever sice theis design came out I just liked the look of it,
1450 no its my the biggest the iPhone 6 7 8 6s all have bigger screen,
Did he just say Great job Samsung LMAO I love my iPhone X,
It is thicker than the iPhone 7 or 8 How would apple go from something thinner to something thicker,
Bruh this review was just great You are really a great reviewer I just got my X today and watched your review on it Very informative and to the point Thank you for a great review Actually enjoyed it And you made me proud that I got this phone today Keep up the great work,
999 and its slower than a 350 Xiaomi Mi Mix,
Funny enough after updating to iOS 1141 the ability to watch 1440p on YouTube was removed on the iPhoneX,
You actually took your time using the device before reviewing it HOW,
Watching this on my Galaxy S8,
your welcome *smug smile ,
Will wait for iPhone 9 wasnt impressed with 2017,
super retina or lower than 1440p but 5 higher than 1080p,
GOOD JOB SAMSUNG DIDNT SEE THAT COMING,
This is an amazing phone no matter what,
i like how he rarely has any background music playing clean,
But have years of updates The ios 12 will make it like a beast,
What if a cop holds your Iphone Face ID up to your face,
_Youll get used to it_ *MKBHD 2017*,
I want the iPhone x but im wait 4 iPhone x1,
Idk if I should get the X or a Galaxy S9,
You are my favorite youtuber by far,
706 GOOD JOB APPLE*,
Ive been waiting for this review since before iPhone X even released lol Im surprised that you were able to make the full review this soon but as always you did an awesome job ,
The Sharpest 4K videos on YouTube,
Great review just got mine yesterday and loving it,
Good I was looking for a video about some things positive about this iPhone X good videos by the way,
Love my iPhone X,
Top notch design ,
I love it when you said Apple are stubborn btw love my Iphone x Best review,
Intro song ,
You are awesome bcz youre videos is best quality,
Good job samsung,
Thx for great Review,
That intro team is pure fire Is that custom,
its not small 3  your hands are just Big,
You can buy REFURBISHED Apple X on Amazon,
Ive at least watched this video 20 times,
Animojis works with the help of dot projector which is right besides the front camera MKBHD,
Facial recognition Tfw you have a twin,
I guess you could say the iPhone X is top notch,
Good job Samsung,
Totally biased Now I know your Apple fan,
I like iPhones notification system it shows up chronologically,
I prefer fingerprint sensors especially on the back of the phone imo its so fast and intuitive to quickly open your phone,
The iPhone 4 was the first phone with glass back,
Loved that that vidioseption,
holy shit the pixels 2 selfies are unbelievable,
WTF feels more modern because of swiping and gestures Gimmick thats more movement so less modern,
No dBrand Grip review yet,
I think the X is the most perfectly designed iPhone even better than XS The only other iPhone I feel was as perfect for its time in design  build perfection is the iPhone 5C No camera bump on the 5C totally flush,
Next years iPhone will still have a notch,
Great review bud top stuff with some good humour too,
Your videos are good youre voice is pleasant youre video is very good  and important i learned enough take a job bij Apple keep up the good work ,
We Cant Bring Back Steve Jobs Though,
Im going to buy one of these somewhere close 2019,
Youre going to take this notch and take it with a smile,
Im getting an iPhone X in May Im so exited but Im scared iM gonna break the glass,
The Lumia 920 could charge wirelessly It had a plastic back and came out over five years ago,
you shouldve cover the dot mapping sensor  probably thats where the animoji gets the info and movement from your face ,
iphone x sharp aquos clone,
That is one cool hoodie,
Is it worth two Oneplus 5Ts,
I wonder why people are so expressive that they clicked the thumbs down button,
706 you just got a new subscriber,
Imagine if the Apple logo on the back of the phone was also a touchid button It would be so sick,
Videos been up exactly one minute and already has 275 comments,
Thank you for this video *,
It was really funny I wanted to no what wallpaper that was Lol,
Backup to job for 1000 in 2 months,
This is so unbiased I love it,
Ahhhnahhh ill stick with my 4s i paid 15 for,
Im sorry did i miss the fundamental changes or there isnt really any fundamental changes I think Im gonna go with the ladder,
Fantastic review Straight to the points and answers all the main questions Cheers,
Ok I think I have to say that the notch makes the phone more beautiful,
The answer to every WHY question is Because 2017 thats why Is there an option in the iPhone to internally mask off or disregard the pixels on the left and right sides of the notch so I can get my whole status bar back If not maybe theyll INVENT that technology next year,
Thank you I used to swipe up and hold too,
they could put a fingerprint sensor in the back when we are giving 1000 dollar for this,
What about SAR Why nobody talks about it Iphone always had hudge SAR I m sure this one to,
YesI agree a bigger iPhone would be greatIm looking forward to seeing the bigger one coming,
Blink twice if they hold you hostage Marques,
The galaxy android phones have so much specifications and features for lower prices than iphone,
Great review Thanks man,
lmaooo the whole notch situation had me legit laughing out loud oh apple,
Why didnt apple just ad Touch ID in the apple logo and have a small notch like the one plus 6T,
no one noticed when he said Good Job Samsung,
You have discord whats your name,
I actually still love the iPhone X in every way To me its perfect Ive owned an android for the past 6 years and this phone made me switch,
you always pick such great music,
The iPhone is just too fluid and smoothwith amazing longevity samsung doesnt come close where it matters updates and quality software integrationthey fail hardphones become almost unusable compare an iPhone,
I cant believe that they made a good phone Good job Samsung,
Go ahead buy a iPhone X For a cookie,
Excellent review I currently have the 8 Plus but cant wait to upgrade to either the successor to the X or the X Plus Where did you get that wallpaper I really like it and would like to download it,
We cant tell swiper no swiping anymore,
just accept it get used to it welcome to 2017  bro,
Could you please make a video where you compare the note 8 samsung s8 plus and the iphone X and which one would you buy and by then could you just answer the question of which one would you buy  Thanks in advance,
it may be good but I find this phone too Xpensive,
Lmao a 1000 bucks for Apple to enslave me with their updates and insurance,
Bro thats not even yo voice my nikkah lol,
Why cant they just make the apple logo itself the fingerprint reader,
I love Iphone but my phone is Huawei,
You made me by the Iphone X thank you I dont regret,
GOOD JOB SAMSUNGTHAT WAS SICKKKKKKKK,
150 Just had to wait a year no worries,
Swipe swipe swipe and more swipe,
As silly as I think the notch is it does actually look pretty cool when the map app wraps around it,
Hi sorry to bother you Lol,
Not impressed with the camera,
Apple and BlackBerry,
Love your hoodie man,
iPhone 10 for 1000 but not support Bulgarian language This has bothered me for years They support Russian Romanian Greek and Turkish but not Bulgarian language Why is that,
That was a funny I didnt notice that you didnt talk about the specs yet,
Do you have to be in a light room for Face ID to work,
Intro is dope ,
Top notch review and channel I decided to get the X and now Ive been watching videos to pump myself up,
I wish I had 1k to blow on a piece like that,
I love my iPhone X Its my daily driver over my s8 plus note8 and pixel xl It just feels perfect in my hand just the right size for me,
Tech999k is a nice instagram account,
Marques is brilliant Thanks for all of your awesome videos you make,
I had a choiche between an iphone 8 or a x and I choose the 8 cause I could never get used to that damn eyebrow,
Hmm to get or not to get,
your iphone x review,
you are a genius bro,
Finally The only review need to see,
Haaah That accessibility option was there on Windows mobile waaayyy before,
Updating from 7 to x worth the price,
can you send animoji to android user or iPhone on previous iOS,
His editing skills are unmatched,
You are absolutely the best tech reviewer on YouTube Hands down Hopefully after all the iPhone X sales expectations get met they will do an update to allow the iPhone 8 to do the animogis as well I am looking forward to getting my iPhone X in a couple of weeks I am a quadriplegic and face ID and the gestures should be awesome for me due lack of to finger dexterity,
error,
I have it i didnt buy it it was for free,
Im watching this on my 4s,
I never got why people dont put cases on their phones,
Best Review for the IPhone X,
still waiting on the Grip review,
Cracked screen 279 to fix,
His lisp bothers me,
Hi sir I like i phone x very much And i love i phone x Your dress is awesome,
Im just here for the comments,
Good presentation,
i have a twin brother and am about to buy an iphone x so im kind of curious to see if it will unlock for him,
Fortnite and Marques brownlee,
so now youre diggin apple lol,
Screw the phone Where can I buy the hoodie,
i want to know more about the front camera in iphone x please,
That animoji part had me pissing myself,
Thumbs up if you are leaving iPhone and buying Pixel,
I always wanted a phone that feels as premium as an iPhone but has Android as its operating system The pixel came in I bought it I love it And trust me guys it is way more better than an iPhone be it in terms of camera or the feel or the swiftness of operating it everything is just brilliant I got a very good deal in my country in exchange of my old Nexus 5 so the pricing for me was good too Go for it ,
I think the design is gorgeous I dont know why people dont like it I would rather have bezels than block the screen with my hands most of the time when consuming media and playing games While small bezels look prettier but they are not very practical for a phone If I ever switch to Android I would get the Pixel XL But there is a mighty IF,
I think it is cool looking I bought one,
006 Do we want Jet Black or Matte Black yes,
Now you can have matte black and jet black in one phone,
this is the result after samsung and iphones have babies,
Headphone port on the top Because nothing is more annoying than headphone cables dangling over the screen Why is it still a thing to put the port there instead of at the bottom,
ordered mine 128GB black to replace my note 7 ,
That phone could donate some chins for leafy,
it would be an iphone killer if it wasnt so ugly,
Im sold,
People complaining about the storage and Im here like wtf are you doing that needs so much space Call me crazy but I dont take 50 pictures of my food every time I order something and a selfie every minute of every day,
Pretty sure its actually made by HTC,
2018 anyone,
no microsd card expansion even after Android Marshmallow Adoptive Storage nor dual sim no wireless charging but apparently 7 hours charge in 15 minutes no water proofing no dualsteroe speakers asking price of 650 for lesser version But hey at least it has a headphone jack and doesnt blow up cuz thats a bonus these days Cant say that Im that excited for this phone Yes I do need a new phone but not THAT badly,
Unlimited photo and video storage is shift plus Now I can have tons of porn on my phone,
Apple fan boys probably waiting for TECHREX to destroy this phone,
Wow cant wait to buy one but its even more expensive here in the Philippines,
Hey Please do the comparison between iphone 7 and google pixel ,
Cant wait for the Pixel 2,
I am so alone lol I actually like the design Nothing that dBrands cant solve after all,
the chin was probably there for being able to fit enough hardware and keep the balance between the bottom and the top plus while most dont some complain about having to reach down with their thumbs to click the home button so that fixes that but I agree it is a bit big,
Why not call this the Gphone,
amoled display thank you jesus,
Why does it look like an iPhone,
I have one and its so cool I was hoping for an iPhone but this is 10x better if your watching this to see if u should get it do it,
After 7 years of being apple loyal user and 6 iPhones from apple I give up time to switch Im no longer able to handle apple bs,
Anyone else in 2019,
Using in 2018 Still a Great Phone in 200 used condition running Android P,
RIP Nexus My Sony Nexus dream will never come true ,
Everything is good but price is bad,
To be honest at that price point I cant get over thinking why they didnt include enhanced waterproofing as a feature with the Pixel Everybody that sell phones at this kind of price range does why dont you Google,
google and htc worked together on the phone,
it sucks because the note 7 was like my favorite design on a phone ever and now they are forcing everyone that has one to get a different phone ive been waiting so long for it and now this bullshit happens,
If Marques replies I will eat this comment,
its great phone after iphoen 7 plus  i love it ,
hey guys i seriously think that pixel is a 100 times better apple iPhone,
APPLEnote 7 is out of compititionnow we will rule GOOGLEthen introduces pixelnew competitor APPLEwhat the f,
beautiful animated UI who says that simplicity cant be expressively,
Somehow i feel the urge to peel the glossy plastic thingy on the back of the phone,
is it Crack resident,
is that google pixel and google pixel plus design looks similar to fruit brand phone,
I suspect there are a lot of Note 7 fans here seeking a crumb of comfort Personally I didnt get it its not beautiful enough,
Thank god google ive been settling with apple for the last 4 years waiting for the perfect android I can finally end my suffering,
no Duo sim no Micro sd and no water resistance No Buy,
Was hoping it to be around550Welp,
only paying 45 for the 128gb Pixel thanks to my upgrade ,
The Pixel *holds up phone* and the Pixel XL *holds up smaller phone*,
I love this phone bought one yesterday and it has exceeded my expectations,
Everybody is complaining about how it doesnt have waterproofing but ive never had a waterproof phone and have never had water damage What is it you people do with your phones exactly,
Cloudy with a chance of clouds Haha omg,
Its too expensive for my taste I hope it will get cheaper like the Nexus 6P did,
ultra cool man oowwwffff,
Whats the weather like Cloudy with a chance of clouds Thanks Google,
last time I was this early Google still made Nexus phones,
LG V20 was first phone out of box with android 70,
I literally NEED THIS PHONE,
nochin,
looks like a great phone excited for the full review so I can make my final decision,
I bet Leafy wishes he had a chin that big,
Looking forward to your amazing coverage on the pixel Marques Personally I think its a great phone and definitely worth my money,
Wow thats some accurate weather predictions Cloudy with a chance of clouds oo,
I think am gonna wait till next year for Pixel V20 with Snapdragon 830built on 10nm process Would be a beast in performance as well as battery LIFE,
Nexus  pixel agree,
*iPhone users in the Google store* yeah um one google pixel pls *worker*  What you say buddy *iPhone user* one Pixel *worker* sir is that a Apple in right there *iPhone user* *sweats nervously* um where *worker* right there *iPhone user turns around and sees a granny smith apple on the floor*,
Nice backdrop Very original,
ohmygosh Isnt he from AndroidPolice 034 What a man,
your voice and accent was really neat Im not American but could still understand everything u said,
My main gripe is the chin Wasted opportunity for stereo front facing speakers,
I guess the symmetrical chin is for gaming who needs this,
Thanks for the review I will stick to my Nexus 6P,
Damn I want this phone Id throw away my iPhone for this any day But my ass knows that Ill just switch it for a 7 XD speaking of SwitchI WANT THE NINTENDO SWITCH NOW,
Pixel got a great opportunity as S7 is down Is this a conspiracy Google targeted Note 7 and heavily priced random thoughts,
Wow Googles new iPhones look great,
Hey bro bro bro bro  STOP I have only 1 word for this phone just OMG O,
this is way far from being as good as the s7 or htc m10 or even xperia xz not suprising since its their first phone ever,
This is the most revolutionary product design since the HP Spectre One,
Just preordered the Pixel CANT WAIT TO GET IT,
Wait until next year to buy The Pixel will be half price and then it will be worth a look,
Hey bro whats name the intro please,
rotating earth HD app is a really nice animated skin similar concept to the background you were talking about worth checking out,
You should review the xiaomi mi5 it has the snapdragon 4gb of ram and its only 350,
the large chin helps in my opinion when parents arent phone savvy and accidently hit back or home when using my Samsung note 3 keep chins its a good things,
I was soo happy with my nexus 5x because of the price and I was planing on buying the pixel but its waaayyy overpriced,
Hey Marques Im watching your videos since the beginning and I finally signed up for an account I just wanted to let you know that even compared to your recent videos this one is so exceptionally good in quality and style Keep going and improving you are a great inspiration for many young people,
you have to dbrandcom this thing for the phone to look good,
According to Chinese media1 million of this phones have been produced,
This pretty much might be my next phone if the battery holds up So please mention the how goodbad the battery is in all its glory cos I have a decision to make asap Thanks,
No OIS on camera No Water Resistant No Stereo Speakers and same price as an iPhone 7,
Youre one stop for all things pixel why you stalling from AA,
could you please review Huawei P9 and honor 8,
fuvk the pixel Im getting the Sony XZ,
Autogenerated captions Im cabby HD,
0350  Whats the weather  Cloudy with a CHANCE of cloud wat,
Hi is this phone worth the upgrade from Sony z5 compact,
Im a big fan of this design idea of fingermagnet material being away from where u hold fingers normally is very interesting also really blue color is amazing for me as I always loved Lumia colors  phones are kind of todays jewelry so it needs to pop for me at least symetry on front  for me its okay  thats why I have HTC One m8s  without symmetry my OCD would kill me P thats just my opinion let me throw it here,
might upgrade to this eventually after my Nexus 6P Stock Android is my favorite,
can you do a review of the Android 711 too,
Less features than the Note 7 and uglier than the iPhone I dont see this phone really selling out anywhere This phone is underwhelming for me especially for what they delivered on the Nexus 6p ,
Lol I liked your RIP Nexus remark As a longtime Nexus user Im a bit disappointed that they didnt retain the Nexus name,
Do a comparison video with Pixel and the Galaxy S7 please Id like to here what you think ,
Insanely too expensivewould prefer to go for Iphone 7 instead of trying this one for such high price,
THIS IS SO MY PHONE ,
Gotta have a chin like that to fit a head phone jack lmfao,
I just preordered my Pixel c,
Still on Nexus 5 not one single problem I still can do whatever you do with your new 1000 smartphones and I feel great thank you o,
watching this on my pixel xl its amazing and battery is the best Ive ever had 6hrs SOT and 14 hrs on and still on 14,
Android is 7 already They be running after win10 mac10,
hey marques chill out with the chin hate leafy might be watcing,
I definitely am impressed by the Google pixel but Im gonna stick with the ZTE Axon 7,
This phone looks amazing I definitely am going to try to get the second generation as my current phone iPhone 6s isnt payed off and I want the second generation of Pixel for a more protective structure,
My mother got me an iPhone 6 _ why me why must I suffer what did I do to deserve this,
I could get a note 7 but I like my legs I could get an iPhone 7 but I like my freedom This is a good in between Great specs better camera battery and no blot,
whats the weather Cloudy with a chance of clouds,
When Android And IOS Have A Baby,
CORRECTION  Its made by HTC,
It has proven one thing And that is inner beauty is what matters more,
Actually Asus were the first to make a phone with the Snapdragon 821 and 6GB of RAM Its called the ZenFone 3 Deluxe,
Come on stop with the chin jokes,
only 1 million phones sold untill now S8 sold 5 million in a single month,
Pros easy to use a lot of app Cons they collect your information and activities without letting you know The price is not reasonable,
Im pretty much sold need to upgrade from my old Xperia J and since Note 7 is you know quite the boom lately I might wait for some more for Pixel,
its slick but its no Motorola v120,
There are 400 smartphones that are build just as premium as this and offer more than this google phone WTF is google thinking with this pricing,
Glad you mentioned the headphone jack Was getting worried when it wasnt shown right next to the charging port,
Extremely ugly UI Extremely ugly design Did HTC design Pixel Only HTC can design something this disgusting,
Is it faster then the iPhone 7 245 Ghz processor if so Im impressed,
That phone is _really_ blue But I do _quite_ prefer the black The silver is _very_ nice still,
Im definitely going pick this up I wish google had some kind of trade in system like apple that would be nice,
You had me until the price ,
Yes the phone is ugly Whatever else is probably is just stock nougat With some extra frontier Googliness  Great But yes ugly phone indeed Pity,
Ahhhh I want my phone to come in  maybe a full review will help tide me over come on I need a fix lol,
LeafyIsHere NoChin,
I hate my life so much  in the tech side  I still cant order this amazing phoneAnd tech is like 50 more of the price,
Ive preordered my XL Cant wait,
love it Looks good perform well Ill be returning my note 7 today,
i love my pixel,
I cant wait for the DBrand skins on this one D,
motorola being an avid android adopter if they were to make a new phone they would use this native   skin  android ,
I really love all google phone Ive used Nexus 6 which is stunning phone I love big screen pure Android and good for using in daily life Unfortunately screen has broken but everything is still be good so I bough Huawei for instead Now I uses 2 great smartphones at the same time,
That Parallex Hall tracker be on point *0*,
HTC chin you know what Im talking about,
First phone with Snap821 is Xiaomi Mi5sPlus,
This phone is hotI it,
I just picked one up today since my 6plus broke,
Anyone watching after release of pixel 2,
will be waiiting for the review for sureso it dos have volume rockers in the same side as the power button,
I think Ill probably stick to my insured OnePlus 3 The Google Pixel looks like a lot of fun but its been a while since Google actually produced anything originally new basically they changed names to everything they had invented before just to sell it better,
Cloudy with a chance of clouds,
Id say that Im pretty happy with my nexus 5x it has android 7 and a similar look  feel to the pixel for half the cost not to mention it sports the same 12 megapixel camera,
dont like the back design but Jarvis kinda cool,
Talk about the upcoming Nokia phones ,
Is it just me or that phone looks really chunky Thick bezels and seems like a thick phone in general,
How is the Pixel versus the One Plus 3T,
thank god i have moto x stylepure ultra thin Bezels and small chin,
iOS FTW,
how this could be the fastest aint Iphone 7Plus is the fastest,
No thanks My LG G3 is still kicking ass,
reasons why I hate this The back looks like an IPhone the headphone is on the top the headphone dangles on screen,
Could you do a Snapchat test on the Pixel when it comes out or when you get one,
Meanwhile OnePlus2 319 and OnePlus3 399,
Thumbs up if you wanna see a Nexus 5x successor with similar design but without bootloop problems,
leafy is jealous of that chin,
link on the wallpaper of the black pixel xl please,
I would buy it if all those features with the design of the Nexus 6 Small chin no bump dual flash and dual front facing speakers big screen etc,
even my huawei p8 lite has a 13 megapixel,
045 pretty familiar shape *cough iPhone cough*,
disappointing price not disappointing specs mkbhd cant wait for wait you think,
LG V20S still the best phone of 2016,
Pixel offsets android users in a sense giving justice to the android OS system,
actually it is manufactured by Micromax company from India ,
this iz called a real phn with sooo manyy multiple functions,
Pixel is the first phone made entirely by Google inside and out I dont want to be a Debbie downerbut you are actually incorrect The Pixel phone was manufactured by HTC for Google However Google takes full credit for its design,
i lovr it,
nope  the fastest phone is oneplus 3,
are they going to stop making Nexus,
This was enough for me to order the OP3,
Marques Brownlee Hmmm didnt xiaomis Mi5s release the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 before Pixel And if Im not wrong both the Pixel and the Mi5s use the same Sony IMX378 camera I did have a question though a lot of websites are calling the new pixel as HTC Google Pixel is that a mistake I was under the impression that HTC manufactured this for Google as well,
plz can you make a video on htc u ultra plz My man,
Pixel vs Oneplus 3,
asus zenfone 3 deluxe the first one with SD 821,
s7 edge or pixel xl gotta replace this awsome note 7 ,
I have a OnePlus 3 is it worth switching to the Google Pixel,
ONLY 12 J5 has got 13mpx,
pensei em comprar mas a entrada de fone na parte de cima do celular me fez desistir at de pensar na compra erro de design do caralho,
glass  for no reason  on back fail,
I think that phones with bezels are more likely to still work after you drop them,
prezentri telefonul,
I love having a finger print scanner in the back Especially when your phone is mounted on the dashboard in your car and youre driving and you have to unmount it to use the scannerI LOVE IT,
Looks ugly af 6P and V20 looks a lot better what has happened to google,
Nice backgrounds,
I can finally use finger print gestures on my Nexus 5x,
Water Resistance Even iPhone got it,
Definitely Definitely my next daily driver and the best of the lot ,
Leafyishere needs this phone to make up for,
Your videos are always awesome I love it I am using Android since jellybean I havent used iPhones as my daily driver Thinking to buy a new phone Should i buy an IPHONE or stick to Android ,
Ah damn  costs too much ,
need some pro opinions should I go for Pixel or Moto z,
Does anybody know whether the phone is Project Tango enabled Thanks,
Really disappointed with price Verizon exclusivity and the design Seems like a regression,
Fastest phone of all time Seriously Its not even at iPhone 6s level with single core scores The iPhone 7 draws circles around it in terms of speed,
Pixel XL P XL Ahhhh I see what you did there Google,
Moto z play is better,
is there a LED notification light,
way too expensive and I still dont like buttons on the back of phones Im now 100 my next phone will be the OnePlus 3 it looks like nobody can beat that,
I just got My Pixel XL Today and it has Raise To Wake and also has notifications that are in black and white with pix,
Why is lg v20 locked smk I was really interested in that phone,
great specs with reasonable price i think it is convincing,
nice design but that proximity sensor in the middle of top screen just looks awful,
this thing will replace iPhone,
im using a black one for work used to iphones but i love this phone and i find the design beautiful,
The real time Earth wallpaper is the best thing about the phone,
I like the sound your voice,
if only the price where i am is below 1K,
that price tho and it will only get 2years of update shame on you google,
*_YESSS Headphone jack We needed this_*,
NEXUS I MISS YOU SO MUCH,
copiou o design do I phone completamente heim,
The headphone jack on top Ill not buy this phone just because the they place headphone jack on top,
fastest phone pit it against the iPhone 7 then we see,
But iPhone is the origanal and the father of all smart phones,
Plz do a review of Lenovo p2,
we can get Stock Android phones but no stock Android Tablets,
Cloudy with a chance of clouds,
Complaining about bezel size is just as bad as complaining about how thick a phone is because more of either means more battery And more battery is always a good thing,
I Hate Everything about this phone apple4life,
When can we expect ur review of Pixel XL,
is it possible to get that unlock screen wallpaper of the canyon on other phones,
thanks for the great review,
At least the phone has a chin,
maby its time to upgrade my 2013 nexus 5,
is this sundar pichais voice in background m sure it is,
Yes it is fantastic I highly recommend it,
too bad they didnt utilize that chin with front facing speakers,
With that huge chinshould have forward facing speakers,
Oppo has the best camera it has 16mp,
Cloudy with a chance of clouds,
cloudy with a chance of clouds lmao troll,
145 More difference is that the Pixel XL has QHD and the Pixel has FHD,
thanks mkbhd I am surely buyin it,
Not gonna get the 71 on my Galaxy S5  I really need to upgrade soon,
Can you do one on the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Trying to decide between that and the LG V20,
when marquess worst lighting possible looks like my best lighting possible 304,
Yo I need a phone that can be a good replacement for the note 7 I was going to get,
Great video as always It would be nice though if mention if it has an SD card reader next you do an android review If anyone is wonder the Google Pixel does not have expandable storage,
Wow Almost 4M views Congrats on that success Marques,
no doubt everybody curious i hope god allmighty give me this gadget,
mkbhd  whats the weather google  cloudy with a chance of clouds,
Is this guy supposed to be a tech guru Its not the first phone to have Snapdragon 821 Xiaomi 5S came out months earlier featuring this chip,
maiami yacin best new comer pleas linsting,
770  tax for what amounts to a Nexus with a little bit better camera Not a chance in hell Id buy this Im thinking for 400 I could get a OnePlus 3 or even last years Moto X pure for less,
I cant wait for your full review,
I read article said that it was manufactured by HTC for Google,
Instead of using software buttons why not place them within the huge bezel on the bottom Makes no sense using up some of the little display screen when the phone already comes with ridiculously huge bezels What an epic fail,
are you gonna ever make a review ,
I wish this had actual buttons on the chin just because its useless otherwise,
already preorederd the silver pixel xl,
Looks fantastic especially since I am an Apple fan,
Hi Marques Do you have any idea why is the Pixel 128GB out of stock ,
i really want this phone but nope not coming to sweden,
This is the first Google phone yes made by HTC but they would not credit them similarly to the first iPhone released by Apple So for a first phone its quite good but obviously there will be flaws you may hate the design bezels etc Im sure the next version of Pixel would be improved with feedbackcriticisms Every company has to start off somewhere but rarely start at the top,
Wait so no Nexus I thought HTC was making them this year CLARIFYYYYY,
Lol They didnt mention them have a ral trlphone included,
If att gets this phone i will be replacing my note 7RIP with this phone,
did he say 4k camera,
This looks great Ill get rid of my iPhone for this,
Durability needs to be great,
It has a headphone jack SOLD,
No SD no waterproofing huge bezels no button no headphones included no wireless charge no super oled screen and yet more expensive than a s7 or note 7 with all those things google are really off the mark here Its like a 150 dollar Chinese copy iPhone,
Wait so no Nexus I thought HTC was making them this year CLARIFYYYY,
Does it lag on hearthstone How long of usage until it starts lagging,
looks like a fancy Nexus I really like it BUT cant see dropping 650 on this phone but to each is own,
Athletic appointment bubble achieve outcome surprisingly strange myth,
the phone just went one year back in time from nexus,
Im switching from an iPhone and was wondering what would be a better change the Galaxy S7 Edge or this,
always had a nexus but i think i will skip the pixel,
The symmetrychin is with VR in mind,
although it does look like a good phone however I think Im gonna stick to my Sony Xperia Z2,
Pixel is not convincing enough for a 650 dollar price tag Like the comment if you agree,
I was totally sold on this phone until I saw it had onscreen buttons for home task manager and return Both Samsung and Apple use actual buttons at least for home,
pretty sure its manufactured by HTC look it up,
I definitely want this phone xd,
045 like if you got it,
That looks ugly tbh,
the round icons are stupid app icons should have distinct shapes from each other like on a pc,
Jimmy Hill would have liked this,
Apple should start learning,
This or the LG V20,
If the bezels werent so friken huge for no reason I would be happier Im still staying team OP3 This thing is too Damn expensive,
the os looks gorgeous now i love the pixel launcher i still hate that white app drawer though,
No front speakers thats a deal breaker for me,
203  if the Pixel wasnt two times slower than the iPhone that may be the case,
I just got the pixel and tbh its amazing Videos dont do it justice While it DOES share a lot of similarities to the iPhone on the surface the software raw processing power and camera blow me away,
pretty familiar shape *cough*,
Too much chin on that phoneJay Leno would be likeDaaaaaamnThats a lot of chin P,
I love google but whoever designed this should be fired asap,
Two days in with my new pixel and I have to say it is by far my favorite Smart phone Ive ever experienced emphasis on smart it is truly the Smartest phone on the market Ive used many Android and iPhone s but so far Im blown away by what Google is doing from here on out thanks for the great videos,
They taught Alexa to rap but not set timers,
Siri and Google assistant was the best until bixby started rapping with a beat unlike the others,
Google is for everyday life Bixby is for internal phone functionality Siri is for business and work Alexa is mostly for fun,
Bixby needs to drop and album 1629,
Marques Open Play Store and download Uber Google No camera app installed,
You cheated you asked siri how tall is Obama  so i dont see the fair part of the vid ps bixby at the time was beta,
But at least Alexa can play Despacito,
I feel like siri cheated at 925,
Cortana hello Im here too man * _slaps leg_ * no one notices me ,
Dammn 1022 godman siri Whats the population Siri  its the human population,
Bixby is so lovable its trying so hard haha,
At 1353 Bixby set the alarm for 730 PM If you had to wake up early the next day youd be screwed,
iOSSiri AmazonAlexa RapBixby GoogleAssistant HotelTrivago,
Bixby nailed it with the raps and beats too,
At 920 Siri couldnt answer it then you asked her the question directly which ruined the whole point of it,
What is the capital of Nepal How tall is he,
This Is So Sad Alexa Play Despacito Oh Wait,
Drop that beat Bixby,
we want the 2019 edition ,
Bixby  the rap god,
The Siri Obama question was not fair You had to ask Siri again so it failed on followupconversation questions but you still gave it a check,
You forgot Cortana,
Bixby is still in beta and can do very specific commands but it cant have a conversation or remember what you were talking about because the data clears,
Set the alarm for 730 *PM*,
ask bixby to open google assistant,
602 Thanks For Asking about our Country NEPAL,
The Google AI was suprisingly good at conversations,
Now bixby 30 has arrived hope youll make a new updated video,
GOOGLE ASSISTANT WAS BEST IS BEST AND HE WILL STAY BEST,
Damn Alexa is terrible Also google absolutely destroyed the others,
Isnt alexa rude,
Its human population,
1626 *I didnt know Bixby could rap so well*,
Result  1st google 2nd bixby 3rd Siri 4th Alexa,
Bixby is drunk af,
Youre supposed to say OK Google take a selfie it works better that way,
I was like no way Bixby is that good at rapping and on my s9 I said rap for me and it started dissing APPLE AND BLACKBERRY lol and it had fire music lol,
Sadly Google assistant has some limited specific tasks it can perform Selfie Camera And some functions,
Can you do another video of voice assistance battle in 2019 pls,
The Siri question for Obamas height is unfair because you said how tall is Barak Obama and for the others you said how tall is he,
By the end of this video at least I have memorized what 20x158 is,
This dudes intro was copied from a Samsung theme,
1141 Person Open the camera app and take a selfie Google No camera app installed 1153 Person open the play store search Uber and install the first app Google *NO CAMERA APP INSTALLED*,
Think youll post a 2019 Voice Assistant battle,
I asked Cortana to rap for me she replied with _I think we both know that would be painful_ she aint having any of that shit XD,
I love G O O G L E and B I X B Y My note 9 has both,
Im an Apple fan and he still seems a bit biased towards Apple,
Alexa is your friend Siri is your personal assistant,
I prefer Google Assistant,
Google Assistant  An A student who is always on time but also has no sense of humor Alexa  That kid in school who always fell asleep on the desk but teachers never did anything about it because they knew shed fight them Siri  Pampered rich kid who dresses well but is also completely oblivious on how the outside world works Bixby  The class clown who is really trying her best but is still a lovable clutz,
Kathmandu,
Siri fir noobs Alexa for casual Google Assistant for pros Cortana for legends,
you forgot cortana,
Me To SiriWhats the population Siri Its human population *Oh I thought it was populated by aliens*,
Google is smart Siri is fast Bixby is dumb Alexas voice is cringey,
Ranveer singh bixby ka time ayega In English  Ranveer singh bixbys time will come,
I am an avid apple user I use siri enough to know she isnt great She better fail Edit how How do I get siri to do that on my phone,
My rankings is Google Assistant 1st Siri 2nd Alexa 3rd I did not test Bixby,
Google assistant is the winner l have Google assistant,
IMO Siri should have gotten a half mark on the Barack Obama question since she required a clarifying question,
Bruh I thought this was assistants talking to each other,
544 subtitles said hes gay,
Alexa is literally the baddest like actually the worst,
This isnt actually fair to Alexa since its really designed for the speakers,
Thats hot thats hot,
Theyre good at math Why im not,
Ask your google assistant to rap for you and youll see she has a backdrop beat It also sings normal songskinda cute,
Team google assistant,
1149 That is i big mistake,
920  man thats cheating,
alexa phone version was really slow,
weird that bixby set the timer for 730pm and not 730am,
HOW TALL IS HE HOW TALL IS BARACK OBAMA This is not fair,
I asked siri the first 1000 digits of pi shes still going Thats loyalty,
930 cheated you said how tall is Barack Obama not how tall is he,
Cortana,
*Its human population*,
1345 when you wanna wake at 730 am but Bixby understands you more than yourself and decides to wake you at 730 pm instead,
bixby just gave me some Halloween rap,
No camera app installed,
Google is smart  sharp Siri is faster and Bixby is drunk,
Siri rapping is literally me just throws a bunch of random words lmao,
Bixby had beats and everything,
Watching this from Kathmandu Nepal,
A very interesting video to watch But Google wins this one,
Ey I also asked Google Assistant to install Uber and it did it Also it took a ugly pic of me,
siri and ga is best,
Google assistant ,
1626,
701 Barack Obama is my favorite golden state warriors point guard,
Alexaexe has stopped working,
NBAAA champions are the golden State warriors,
Thanks for asking for nepal,
Lmao to Bixby wins the rap battle,
I am watching from Nepal And i was kinda surprised when I suddenly heard you asking about capital of Nepal,
Lol sorry Cortana  034,
Bixby Rapps better than 6ix9ine,
Thanks For knowing about our country Nepal,
Google wins as always,
Bixby nailed the rap than others,
710 yes barack obama is their point guard,
I Like the way that you included Nepal,
Atlest Android users have flexibility of two assistants I have voth bixby  google assistant,
Thats kinda cool The Google assistant and siri are the best and yaa MKBHD im pleased that you highlighted our country Nepal Im a big fan from Nepal Ive suscribed almost every big tech youtubers Thanks from KathmanduNepal,
My mom is the best Voice Assistant ever,
My Echo heard what you had to say about it,
Googles my favourite I first used siri so it actually remains as a good one till day but then googls best,
Love from nepal,
Let the games begin Bixby Siri,
Siri got to cheat the Obama question,
Sorry but youtube rewind said *_fUcKnItE aNd MaRk AsS bRoWnLeE_*,
I hope siri was better like google assistance,
 How far is it to the moon Bixby Whatever the price,
he asked siri twice and he mentioned obama again in the sentence its cheating,
What is the population Its the human population lol,
When your infamous country gets told Love nepal,
He said hed do the same phrase,
cortana is the best,
Google Assistant Siri *Cortana Bixby Alexa skl,
Youwho won the NBA Champion Bixbythe Golden state warriors Youwhos their small forward Bixbyits Kevin the snake,
The moment you said Nepal made me soooo happy you cant imagine Thank you,
Cortana is still my pick Microsoft smartly got me into cell phone biz,
Cortana does not count i guess,
Whoaa I never thought he would ask about Kathmandu because I am From Nepal,
I am from nepal,
I tried set number three on Google assistant and it worked fine My camera app opened up but it didnt take a selfie without being hit like the other phones but its still opened up like yours And when I told it to open the App Store and search for Uber it did that but I already had installed so it just didnt download,
Watching From KATHMANDU Nepal,
That rap in bixby was better than many,
At 920 when he asks Siri how tall barak obama is siri says What you want me to find about Siri has a sense of humour,
I think Google assistant is the best,
Siri is best of course,
These assistants make me feel like Im Dexter from Dexters laboratory They should make a voice assistant like that,
Marques savage didnt even let them finish speaking,
Wheres Voice Assistant Battle 2018,
Bixby doesnt have conversations,
Google Assistant is the best,
Google assistant is definitely my favorite even though I am an iPhone user You should make one for 2018,
Bigsby just dropped some bars,
for the siri test you said How tall is he to siri and siri didnt respond correctly but then you asked siri How tall is baracka obalma and he gave you the right answer 929,
Well the thing with obamas hight on siri wasnt actually right,
Me Hey Bixby whats the weather like today Bixby Hold on 20min later Me Erm Bixby wh Bixby I said *HOLD THE F*CK ON*,
Team Google Assistant,
i love siri,
Actually it looks like i couldnt find the file *10XP*,
When you realize you are watching it from nepal,
1st is Google 2nd is Siri 3rd is Bixby 4th is Alexa,
Thank you great job,
Siri failed but u helped himher for the ans of Barack Obama you are a cheater u want siri to win but she just lost Google rocks Siri shocks,
Wish there really was an Amadeus from SteinsGate 0,
Glad to hear you know Nepal bro love from Nepal,
Jarvis is the best bruhhh,
How far is it to the moon Bixby What ever the price Im sure its out of my budget Im crying,
What about Kortana,
1018 Marqueswhats their population Siriits human population,
I like how Google taught you how to pronounce Nepal and that you corrected yourself on the second try when speaking to Alexa,
Okay time for second battle 2k18,
Alexa is literally the baddest like actually the worst,
These dudes rapping as if Windows 958 errors got a voice,
Google assistant and Siri are the best in my opinion,
*Alexa play despacito*,
Me Hey Siri I want to see a joke Siri Go to your privacy controls and give access to your front camera,
Whats the population Its human population WTF,
Im just curious if they can have a conversation to each other,
I was really impressed by them understanding the corelevance like when you ask how tall he is without saying who he is That is incredibly difficult to make in programming didnt actually know that it was common place to do yet Also taking selfies or downloading apps is really cool,
Just wondering why you didnt use a Google pixel device for the Google assistant,
So you gave Siri a second chance with Obama,
Did he say Nepal Awesome,
Would be great to see a new comparison in Q1 2019,
I watched to much of your videos time to subscribe,
What about Cortana I thought that she would win riiiight Says me in sarcastic tone,
Lol are u using ur Mac pro as a trash can,
Considering how long it has been since the launch of voice assistants We have no significant improvements,
Thanks for asking question about Nepal,
You are showing partiality to siri You faked siri to be having continuity and taking the selfie you took the picture by showing hand and you closed the video when it only searched for uber,
I tried open camera and take a selfie on my google assistant and it worked perfectly Youre improving google,
Bixby Actually looks like I couldnt find the file **Gets XP**,
When you asked siri how tall is he  for barak obahma it shouldnt of got that point,
Do an updated version of this please Its really hard to find anything comparing voice assistants with Bixby 20,
lol even in 2017 we had forgotten Cortana exists,
Bixby irritated me so much when I had an S8,
that doesnt count Siri cant just show you the weather shes supposed to say it thats a fair comparison everybody else said the weather Siri did not so it loses a point come on Judge sings Fair there dude,
927 yup ask the question again that ruin the point of the video not all the points,
Damn Bixby has a sexy voice yo Apple make Siri less robotic and more like Bixby,
on google assistant simply saying take a selfie or install Uber works when you oversimplify the sentence it starts searching for keywords like camera app as a name of an app and fails the simpler the command the better the result,
Alexa go home youre drunk,
I like siri but it will be better if siri dont take the full screen when you active it,
Use Alexa on an Amazon device and the results will be wildly different though,
love from nepal bro,
Its like testing your phone IQ,
I mostly found asking for Web results Try asking to do something on your phone like go to home screen swipe to left etc you will find something awesome,
SIRI FOR LIFE MAN,
Google Assistant does rap now And not only one typical rap They got beats too And they also sing  tell jokes  pickup lines  everything to complete your day Check Them Out,
Bixby is on fire,
Apple and google gave different distances to the moon,
Google Assistanttt,
bro did you really forget about cortana,
Google Siri GOOGLE SIRI alexa,
I was shook when Bixby searched Uber,
Before watching this Siri already lost,
id pick Google Assistant,
Sai ho sai ho,
So basically Google a nerd that Payed attention in school and is a solo player with a low sense of humour but Tries their best Siri a sarcastic person who knows some of their stuff but just cant connect their conversations well Alexa Tries their best by their self to be a cool kid with a good sense of humour with their dad jokes They like to have their drink now and again Bixby an alcoholic drinker who is good fun at partys and can be helpful when sober,
608 he talked about beautiful Nepal,
Blackberry is underrated,
Siri was closest to pronounce Kathmandu correct Honestly its painful to hear your city mispronounced Chinese population I feel your pain when rest of the world cant pronounce any of your word correct,
who else from nepal,
allexa voice is disturbing,
its 2019 and Bixby still cant tell Teslas stock price,
Tesla stock prize back then,
Hi MKBHDhow bout a 2018 version btw we all know who is gonna win,
This guy have subscribers more than justin timberlank cool,
Say what you want Bixby straight fire at the end,
Google is smart Bixby has a lower IQ than the rest but very dilligent Siri is fast but lazy Alexa is Alexa,
Siri and Google asistance,
Really great and informative video Im your newest subscriber,
Felt so proud,
Bix just killed in the rap,
CORTANA I miss her Microsoft shouldve never gave up so easily,
Google Assistant is the best,
Marques Can you make an update about how this has improved and if there is a new king or queen of the AI assistants,
Its so boring watching But I keep watching,
bixpy won the rap battle,
Siri misheard Whos their point guard as Whos there point Guard,
I think that Siri and Google was the best Definitely picking them,
Google  Smart Siri  Older and Faster Bixby  Younger And Faster,
ITS GOOGLE SHES a lot smarter than her competition,
Me whats 20x158 Bixby opens calculator Bixby The answer is 292,
Bixby did the most well in my opinion but the picture questions part was the funniest I lost it,
Whats the population of nepal Siri its human population,
Quit trying to stand up for Siri I know you like apple but come on dude be fair,
One plus tshirt dash charger,
Google assistant was obviously gonna win,
Sir is much faster thn goggle m shocked,
Please do the voice assistant for 2018,
kathmandu ma ta aile 445pm bhako cha ta lol,
Alexa is best one but shes not phone assistant You should know that guys,
Is it just me or is Alexas voice just super unpleasant,
*barack obama is 6 1 tall*,
You were partial with SIRI,
Cortana is unwanted,
love ya Marques but you went waaaay too easy on siri,
Bixby is the rap master,
I have a friend called Marques but pronounced marco,
Um i know she isnt on a phone but hello What about Cortana,
I have the google pixel 3xl in 2019 and ever question he asked works now,
Google assistant is the best but where is cortana and why did you give a chance for Siri when it didnt understand how tall is he  and you gave it a second chance,
709 When he asked How tall is he I started laughing,
Shout out to NEPAL KATHMANDU,
The moment that Alexa started rap I could not stop laughing,
You dont have to ask gassistant to open camera app you can simply ask take a selfie,
When I asked Google Assistant What is your name She said The names Assistant Google Assistant,
Nepal,
Love From Nepal,
C o r t a n a,
thank u for using nepal NEPAL,
You shouldnt have asked Siri a second time,
I still use Google Assistant on a J4 lol,
we need 2018 version of this,
Google is the best for me,
Love from Nepal Marc,
you asked google how tall is he and siri how tall is barack obama,
Thanks a lot for mentioning Nepal,
Any one from Nepal,
He cheated or siri,
yaaaaaaaa thats hot thats hot,
ooooo Bixby can spit some bars,
Do this again,
I love Google assistant,
Ya I knew Siri wouldnt get the conversation one,
Its time Voice Assistant Battles 2K19,
Google Assistant is the best but damn Siri reacts so fast,
Google is best in all,
Bro Moto one power is good ah,
When Alexa did not know who the point guard waswhats the point of asking how tall is he Lel,
m happy you asked capital of NEPAL 605,
*No cAmERa ApP InsTalLeD*,
Yandex Alisa is the best one She has a great sense of humor,
I like Google Assistant It had a more human voice than the others Siri is second place for me,
Test please Russian Alice voice assist Sometimes it really amazing,
Marcus I wanted YOU to pick one,
Siri got a second chance tbh on the Obama question  not a big deal ,
You cheated on Siri by saying How tall is Barak Obama Thats not how it should have gone Marques,
You forgot Cortana,
Than you for invloving nepal in the questions,
Siri does forget the last question After the next question ,
Got to admit something here Siri is god damn fast ,
You should have said Can you rap,
Timers are not supported on this device,
Seguro se los robo v Ok no,
Was I the only one asking the questions with him during the video,
Bixby struggling the whole time D Bixby as soon as it was time to take a selfie or download an app wait I got this D me 0 youre doing amazing sweetie,
From NEPAL,
I would pick a combination of Siri and Googles AI  But since that wont be possible in the near future I stick with the one I have in my phone which is Siri,
710 how it answered right lol,
I think Google is the most realisticuseful for everyday life,
At least I learned that Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal,
Your editing is bomb,
Hey look it mark ass brownie LOL,
siri was realy fast,
Bixby is not really talkative especially when she doesnt know the answer,
Who else is watching this on a RED Hydrogen One,
Glad they didnt put a silver ring around the camera lens like some other phones Any cam bezel that isnt black is horrible for watch photos because it reflects off the crystal,
Competition breeds innovation Because of this company taking this bold leap itll force other smartphone giants to step up Its a win no matter the outcome ,
WHERE IS IT 6 MONTHS LATER,
Hey Marcus Looking for your follow up on this video Itz been more than 3 months now,
With the Hydrogen system thats Helium based,
Thank for showing it  But Im already waiting for the Iphone 10 AKA Iphone Pro AKA Iphone 8 ,
I can make that expression too why dont they sent it to me,
How do you put a case on it I dont want to drop a 1100 dollar cell phone,
Now its time to change your name to mkb4k,
Try to make a skin dbrand,
uww yeahh this really goood i like it this is very revolutionary naaah i wonder how much Marq got paid by just praising ugly gimmicky phone 1 Million,
Knowing RED its not gonna come with the screen which will cost 5000,
Hotel Trivago Review MKBHD,
the metal part ismetal Thanks marquesI thought the metal part was wood,
This hydrogen system is helium based WUT,
Great videos man high quality tech videos to a younger demograph,
MORE UPDATES PLEASE Im still stoked to get mine Definately going to get the lense mod and get back into photos and vids,
I have missed you bro its been 2 years since I have seen your videos It is good to be back,
Not sure Im loving the design I actually think it looks better with the addon though,
Looks like a portable military device that controls bombsaircraft missiles I legit cant tell if thats a good thing or a bad thing,
Just tell me this thing shoots 4k raw and I am taking my checkbook out instantly Really looking forward a bmpc killer from red,
Its been 30 to 45 days Any more news,
Looks tacky as all get outnot what I look for in a phone BUT the tech sounds really cool,
Its really dope but I just dont like the design but overall its a really cool idea and I hope it comes to fruition,
*salivating intensifies*,
Obiwan youre my only hope,
Trial reaction damage tender sky continue aid insight curve,
This Hydrgen system being Heliumbased,
Felt more like a sponsored ad than a review but I enjoyed the video nonetheless I do however think its skeuomorphic target groupcentered design is extremely ugly and limiting but above all its a novelty product by an enthusiast consumer product company this will never work especially at that price,
MKBHD  Bro u literally have no expression in that clip,
Marques making 8k videos and me so poor still watching them in max 720p,
I do lots of recording with my phone so if this one has better cameras than X and screen battery storage etc is on the level with other flagships Im going for it,
An impressively entertaining yet very Intelligent Presentation that was well spoken and wclarity and absolute comprehensionkeep up the great work and spot on subject matter my friendYouve got a new follower** Blessing,
Dont put the headphone jack at the top,
Im sorry Dave Im afraid I cant do that,
You clicked newest first *wow*,
dammit I thought this was from ces 2018 DANG IT I was hoping for an update,
Looks freakin sweet Thanks for the vid,
Holy shit Ok Im VERY excited for this,
This phone puts Apple to shame when it comes to being overpriced,
I would like to see RED focus pun intended on making a camera in the lower price range instead of focusing on making it compact My thoughts are that making electronics and optics small and compact is expensive and I would rather pay a few hundred dollars less for something less compact or the same price as the phone on a camera that gives higher quality video,
Nice device Never heard of RED Gonna have to look into them,
You know what they say about having big hands Big handsbig phone,
I really kinda like it,
Just subtly dropping it on there that this was a world exclusive no biggie,
Man your way of presenting is so natural Super cool,
Hi Im mkbhd Did you know I have big hands,
Im a simple man I buy phone to talk on,
3045 days ,
MotoZ had a baby with a tractor mkbhd 2017,
YEW 95000th like D,
Sounds good and its about 250 cheaper than the iPhone X Itll probably have a great camera as well since its RED doing it  its got a microSD slot Nice,
Bro we need an update on this,
Hi Sir Any latest update about RED Hydrogen phone ,
This is amazing cant wait to order one after I pay off all my tuition,
I love the design on this phone I cant wait for it to come out for the public to buy,
Holy crap thats BEAUTIFUL 3,
Front facing speakers Im Sold,
OOOOOHHH Linus is gonna be super butt mad he didnt get one,
99 of the people commenting dont get the idea behind this amazing phone Its NOT a consumer oriented phone Its looks are at the bottom of the priority list Its all about functionality the closest thing to having a cinema film capable device that fits in your pocket Its for having RED cinema in your pocket Count me in,
You should collaborate with Tailosive Tech,
Well so much for 3045 days,
i wish they could make a more smooth design,
I really hope this succeeds Its too cool not to,
If its a phone from RED the camera should obviously be their helium 8K sensor And it should cost around 50k And have a lot of expensive accesories,
Is my porn going to be 3D,
*so wheres the update*,
prototype or just a case,
If the camera isnt the best thing about the phone then forget it,
I absolutely hope the software on this phone is nice We literally saw nothing about it just from the looks and design this phone will be perfect for me Im definitely interested,
Can you make a video comparing this phone with the LG V30 when you have it I would like to see how they hold up to each other,
Exciting internals Awful GODawful design,
It would be sweet if RED created their own OS since Android blows,
Some have bulletproof waistcoats  others have kevlar smartphones ,
I LOVE IT D THANK YOU HOPEfully theyll make it looooonglasting hiiiighquality stuff 3 ID LOVE TO HAVE THIS ONE Looking EXCITEDLY forward to the AWESOME launch 3,
Idk but by the looks of it I was expecting a nuclear fusion battery lol,
Im mad that there hasnt been more info let out yet,
3540 days got over Is there any update on the Red Hydrogen prototypes,
We are planning to have a baby and sell it to buy this phone I already sold my arms and legs to buy Mac book and bose headphones,
buttery smooth,
How can they expect a customer to order the phone without saying when it will be availableshipped,
Wow a big phone with good features I think its the best for me but I think I cant afford it,
dude whats the audio tune in beginning its really good,
for the affordable price of 5000 ,
Wow Looks so good,
for the love of god tell them not to put the headphone jack on the top,
Bazzels not allowed in 2K17,
I took me about a minute to realise it was a phone,
I call false advertising the phone is not red,
Knowing Red this phone will cost 6000,
Will it work with every carrier Or is RED getting into that too,
Poke any update,
Like Moto Z had a baby with a tractor this is gold,
Congrats on the exclusive Holy crap it is gigantic Ill still remain skeptical but it DOES look kinda neat,
Rest assured folks that the ONE will be the coolest phone EVER I held and played with the 1 unit this week and much better than described here  when you see content standing above the screen it will amaze you Better get preorder in as they will have a hard time with demand when it comes out,
Please make a review on the red hydrogen,
So the only reason I clicked this was to see the whole holographic thing going on,
Interesting  I will pay attention to the continued attention to the development and performance,
These kinds of videos are EXACTLY why I watch your channel,
Its been months How much longer do we have to endure this This This torture,
Aww man they are moving the jack to the top I rather bottem I always put my phone in upside down in my pocket,
As a cinematography enthusiast I would definitely try it thanks to your preview but I would also love to see your full review before Great job Marques and thank you,
This is what a Borg carries aroundwth,
The 2 cameras with flash looks like an emoji face,
they should make the side flat looks better,
I like how you say that the material prototype is EXACTLY what theyre aiming for And its EXACTLY what they intend it to look like Thats a weird way of using the word exactly Maybe something to consider for future videos its extremely seldom I find anything for you to improve on ever,
Waiting for the update on thisand wishing it was OLED too,
Hey Marques Great video Can we get a studio tour Thanks from Toronto Canada,
Another phone will be in the lost memory lane within a few months,
What if with the 2 Lenses they enabled stereoscopic 3d with the holographic display and possibly 3d video recording,
10 months without news on this phone I guess RED abandoned the project ,
Marques Would that Jim you mentioned be Jim Jannard Back in the late 80searly 90s he and his assistant Bobbi used to come into the camera store I managed Olympic Camera in Costa Mesa If you get the chance to speak to him ask him if he remembers me I was tall balding and 200 lbs back then I was at South Coast Plaza one time going down an escalator when I hear someone calling my name on the other escalator I looked up and there was Jim If only my girlfriend had been there I might have scored some major brownie points o,
it is nice,
For anyone whos curious about the price its 1200 ,
Okay30 days are up wheres the additional info,
I will defenitly buy this one when its lunched,
Why yall scared to turn the phone on in the video,
Water resistant to some degree is a must especially if its costing that much But it does look like a nice phone,
Moto z had a baby with Sony Xperia*,
Ordered mina two days after it was announcedwe shall see,
I came here for the holographic display ,
if its really good im goin to get this one oO,
Any new info  What will the mods cost etc,
Love the idea That addon also looked pretty badass I still need to see that UI though,
Holy hell that thing looks like a beast I dread what that price tag would be and since I would of course have to have all the attachments Id probably need to get a phone mortgage,
Ohhhhh that intro man,
Im already saving my cash for this  Its a must COP  THX for the info bro,
RED will find a way to make this 1000 phone a 1000000 phone Lets hope they atleast include the screws,
again with the big hands ,
neat but not worth Also the 3D front screen will prob the way I predicted but well see in a few days,
Came for demonstration of the Holographics Left disappointed,
Youre hands down the best for tech info Keep it up Great video,
Is it running *Android* or *RED* ,
I did not know that you played Ultimate Good sport ,
Expensive blah blah aside OH GOD do i miss Kevlar on my smartphone Its kinda sad Moto never took kevlar farther than theDroid Razr series,
My goodness its early 2018 now WHATS GOING ON WITH THIS PRODUCT I WANNA KNOW,
A Hydrogen phone that isnt water proof Realy,
He looked underwhelmed looking at holographic display,
So this is basically a Moto ZXZ PremiumSteroids,
Can you please review the Light L16 camera,
if it is 4k 60fps that will justify the price,
Holographic display interesting are we talking about Please state the nature of the medical emergency hologram or more the one on glass ,
you can see my reaction **His face remains steal for the wole video**,
OMG Amazing thanks for the sneak preview,
Over a year later This phone flopped Unless the modules are so overwhelmingly good that they justify the hype,
I hope that theyll bring a Mod to use the Smartphone in combination with a RED Cinema Camera Maybe as a screen so you dont have to buy the expensive Screen from RED You just buy the Smartphone and you have a Screen for your RED Camera or Remote Control for RED Cameras If theres a dangerous situation on set you just pick your Hydrogen and you control framing shutter aperture iso  framerate directly from the Phone,
Great job on your reviews Marques Been watching you for a while now and I enjoy your honest opinions and delivery Well done as usual,
This phone reminded me of asus zenfone ARdont know why,
Im just going to keep watching this video until there is new info on this thing,
Not even waterproof or wireless charging for that priceNot worth it,
Published on August 2 2017 Still no sign of that phone,
Low key kind of no reason for me not to buy this Ill wait a bit after it releases to see all the issues that arise bit essentially having a super portable mirrorless camera at all times on me Awesome Sign me up,
The grips on the side are a good idea but its overall ugly no doubt,
HEY GUYS MASS DROP HAS DROPPED THE PRICE OF THE APPLE WATCH 2 Join to make the drop even greater,
FIRST i want to THANK YOU marques for this video and your none overacting and overreakting statement to this phone i really appreciate it and gave you thumb up for that now SECOND i have a question can it be confirmed that this hydrogen one can be used as a monitor for RED cameras especially for the RED EPIC MX,
The rugged look and the kevlar body really catches my attention Im really curious to see the addon features for this,
Thanks love what you do,
I looks like the moto z had a baby with the xperia z5 premium XD,
When I have a job againHELL YEAH haha Thanks man Great review,
Just wondering how do you match the intros bpm with your voice,
Any update on this Update video please,
Keep us updated Bruv lol,
thumbs up if u wanted to see camera samples,
Props to you MKBHD The fact that you scored this exclusive is a testament to the quality content you produce Keep up the good work,
Hearing how much RED charges for there stuff I bet this phone is gonna be at a low price of 2K,
Yawnnnn Soooo this was like you telling me about a car that flies and not showing it happening,
The mobile world badly needs something new Im think and tired of the phones being released all those past years I WANT SOMETHING NEW,
I am getting all the paperwork ready to sell my kidney and other less needed organs can someone tell me when the pre orders start,
Wireless charging sucks I dont even care about a snall wire you already have a big stand with a wire,
It looks sweet but 55 screen seems an odd choice for such a large body 57 would be the sweet spot maybe a but bigger,
I just wanna know if this could be a great vlog camera with red quality,
Who else misses the Ongoing Thing by 20syl intro,
Its called *RED* for a reason,
Hey Marques I was wondering how much do you reckon it will cost to buy one of these beasts,
nice to see another phone with Kevlar I really miss that Motorola phone with a Kevlar back design it was cool,
Your reaction is like I was so so expecting something more than just the 3ds screen cuz that isnt holographic nor 4d,
Dont bother he never turns it on,
When a camera company makes a smartphone you know that camera on the back is gonna be,
My question is does it shoot 12bit RAW footages,
probably costs 10000 and the charger is an extra 999,
pls say something about sony rx 100 VI,
just a prototype it will get better nope lol,
Is MKBHD the Brand Ambassador of RED,
Why cant I find a video that shows the actual holographic display,
I absolutely love that design Its beautiful Looks like a military control to fire missiles or so I would buy it,
People arent going to complain that this phone is a 1000 but will for sure complain about the new iPhone being a 1000,
You should keep updating us on this phone since your the only one who it really showing us anything,
The Camera and the display better be excellent cause my DSLR is heavy af,
its been 40 years now i have a beautiful grandchild now,
Anybody gonna buy this instead of the Iphone X,
The phone design is really ulgy NOW LET ME DEFINE WHAT I MEAN By design i mean how it looks not the material used At a quick look it looks good But that can be easily accomplished with a refined and much better look and design They need without a doubt once they are read to release the phone change it but they can still keep the theme of where they were going Also nowdays prototypes that are displayed for the public is 910 times the end design for the look on the phone,
With this kind of build quality you really dont need any case,
Love that slick Billy Joel sample in the intro song,
Looks like it was made on a year 2005 what a design,
Thank you Red guys FINALLY,
You look like Wes from How to get away with Murder,
Red is the kind of company to put out a pair of headphones that will only work with this phone and charge 400 for them lol,
If were not allowed to see the display how TF we even know itll be worth it,
Good job dude but the display wasnt even lit there wasnt any reflection from it on your eyes so yeah they aint got anything working yet,
so i watched till the end and couldnt get to see the main reason i watched this holographic display,
I actually like the design but a design like that should be waterproof as well,
whos here because of nyjah,
Cant believe this phone is worth 1295 smh now look what you did Apple smh,
Camera,
this is good I like the carbon fiber look,
Dam this phone is HOTTT  love it,
any updates,
That phone will be *DOPE*,
LENS MOUNT ON MAH FONE REEEEEEEEEEEEEE,
no wonder why theyve been killing everyones wallets Theyve been saving up to start production on a new category of devices,
Still a much better deal than Vertu,
Your videos are Wac now Whats up dude,
Why you dont talk about the actual camera quality RED cinema camera,
So essentially a 2011 HTC Evo 3d,
Nice review Marques Thanks for taking the time to share with us Looks pretty promising,
Definitely not preordering because Ive been burnt on crowdfunding projects before By the time it comes out it could be outdated already Thats the problem with these projects that take forever,
Now thats a camera bump I can deal with,
2018,
Is it worth preordering Not till I get more specifics on the tech used on the phone If you can attach lenses through a mount that would be great,
In my opinion this phone is like the Nintendo 3ds most ppl will use the holographic screen to show off but will use the normal screen similar to the Nintendo 3ds,
Subtitles says Hey what is up guys Im qHD here Made my day,
ppl stealin clips from this video all over and not even giving you credit smh,
Im not the target audience but I am pretty excited for this,
The last model was like Optimus Prime,
can u tell when the phone is going to the market,
Can you pls make a back to school tech bc I m going to school very soon thx,
when this product is coming,
far nod attempt wzzpgg cream exit aside tactic,
Looks great but not too sure about spending 1000  for a phone,
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck No I just need to aphone to instagram and tweet bwahahahaha,
Marques Any updates on the Hydrogen One Its been 4 months just curious,
Thanks for sharing an insight on the new advances in technologie that never ceases to amaze me,
You say youre giving honest opinions but youre just giving sponsored opinions If this was an iPhone or LG you would say its crap or it sucks and stuff Its ugly,
RED Im all in  Excellent documentaryreview Money money money  yes You have my justification ,
You got to work on more emotional reaction You are too calm and in control lol,
You got taste in music that sped up billy Joel gave me the fix I needed,
This phone had better be worth the 1200 pricetag,
My man showing us Teslas and Red products like convinced that 90  of his audience can afford and will buy these products,
If this phone has some crazy 3d display and has a camera better than most mirrorless cameras then 1200 is a pretty fair price if not a low price,
i think this is the new best camera phone of the 2018,
we need a compilation of mkbhd saying I have big hands,
i thought it was a smart doorbell at first lol,
Lol people bitching about the phone look ugly expensive and useless to me the phone design is look nice cool and this is just a prototype,
Finally something abit different looking Looks awesome,
Designed for people with Red Cameras Those pins will be for doubling the phone as a camera monitor andor appbase camera control,
not enough to pre order but Im definitely hyped,
blurred out screen Shady ill wait,
Holographic porn,
Looks like the xperia lines of phones,
90 opinions  10 information,
Wow I would sell my soul for this How about a GIVEAWAY,
Why is everyone trying so hard to hate this phone Its not even out yet these are just prototypes Also most likely if you hate the concept its target demographic isnt you Buy a Pixel 2 when it comes out and shut up,
The moto xperia xz premium,
Infreakingsane Cant wait to see the actual product results may consider pre ordering,
Its been 45 days,
ask google assistant if the siri is the best and then answer funny lol,
_ whoa,
Man I get more excited when seeing 5 lunch than you were seeing completely new piece of technology ,
Is everyone forgetting about the HTC Evo 3D,
Ha ha ha MFr doesnt show main feature of phone,
How tf do you dislike a video without watching Haters are real,
You can guarantee the camera and the mods for the camera will be amazing,
HTC Evo 3d did this ages ago Whats popping,
ANTHONY WORKS AT THE GROCERY STORE SAVEING HIS PENNYS FOR SOME DAY,
Hey Marques can you tell us for whom the phone is and if you think it is worth its price tag,
Guys what if this 3D screen can be used to unlock the 3D facial recognition scanner on the iPhone 8 Hack found before release of the phone,
The nerd in me says YES,
I love the look of this phone,
Red hydrogen battery  175 Red hydrogen charging cable 225 Red hydrogen body 575 Red hydrogen lens for camera 490 Red hydrogen sim reader 480,
YES I WANT ONE,
Next phone Helium,
love the slick look of it especially with that mod attached definitely keeping an eye on this bad boy,
Next gen of the Moto Z wow,
For those wondering about the music its Hocus Pocus  On and On,
Why is everyone hating on REDs new phone Its just a prototype and he isnt being really bias he is just trying to give honest insight in what it looks and then what he thinks about it,
That Is a really nice phone I want one but the price holy hell,
so is it basicly the htc evo 3D ,
Wau  really great seeing a company pushing the envelope like that and that the modular concept isnt dead yet I personally would keep the headphone jack at the bottom but overall it looks promising,
But will it use Android 7 or 8,
Im going to McDonalds you guys want anything,
You missed the most important part The camera looks like a face ,
It will be interesting to see if it shoots different frame rates and shutter speeds for the video Im also interested to know if you can choose different codecs to shoot like raw red I just hope you dont need a red rocket card to play back the footage at full quality because that would kill the phone immediately Also Im just imagining the amount of bloatware that will be on it,
This phone is a joke It didnt come with a real screen but I got a proto type second phone with the screen but I cant show you that either but it came with preloaded content just for it Im sick of red and the BS hype around this,
Why do phone makers still put the volume rocker on the left And not with the power but this is a huge deal breaker for me and extremely impractical,
Theirs probably packages to include the charger,
Hands on but is blurred out so what was the point Lmfao world exclusive yeah sure clickbait,
I think its a bold move by Red but would have loved if the design was a bit better,
Can use it to control my rc xd in black ops 2 as well,
Bruh why does the top camera or button thing look like a face,
I love it Id just hate to receive a call after you have all the mods installed and locked into an indie rig ,
Hey Marquis do you have an update on this bad boy I want to order Is there a tentative spec sheet even out,
Just the design it self makes me want to buy it  but then i remember im broke,
Marques reacting to the blurred phone should be a meme,
Man The Camera Is Going to Be Overkillllll,
Phone itself is gonna be 10 grand Then the snap on mods are probably gonna range anywhere from 5005000 each,
Will you be getting your hands on the dev model on Friday,
Ive learned today that its not actually holographic it just give a 3D illusion on the screen it sucks then this is not holographic the hell you looked amazed by looking at it,
Tesla should make a school bus,
Officer do u know why I pulled u over Me in the roadster because I let u,
This car can reach 60 mph faster than what it takes for my phone to open a website,
19 seconds is only the BASE model too,
Can I sleep in it cause I wont be buying a house ,
Not even hypercar this is a whole new catagory,
Buy the god damn car,
I gonna bet that 20 years from now Tesla will become one of the most popular companies of all time as long as they keep doing what theyre doing,
If you are really torn between hitting that reserve button or not and you just need one more reason to give you peace of mind with reserving it just think Psssshhhhh Im not reserving this for myself Im buying this car for the fanstotally And punch that reserve button just like how we punched that like button,
But does it have a headphone jack,
We just wanted to give the ultimate hardcore smackdown to gas powered cars Elon,
they should make knight rider movie and use Tesla Roadster 20 ,
can you do a drop test,
so i look it up on google and apparently formula 1 cars can accelerate 060 in as little as 16 seconds and 0100 in 40 seconds meaning this roadster can accelerate almost as fast as a formula 1 car goddamn,
Can it run iOS 11,
God the torque on that thing at 523 And dead silent too good lord,
Dam this video is already a year old Well we still have 1 year more til the roadster comes,
First time I heard a  Flagship Car ,
And now its in space,
19  Wtf is going on,
So youre the guy who Smith wanted in rewind,
i mean you can live in a car but you cant drive a house amirite,
But doest it have a headphone jack,
tesla should make phones tvs everythingjjjjjj,
its also only like 200k vs most cars like that are 1 mill,
Its just amazing how a company that started 11 years ago have achieved this thing so fast Shows how technology improved over the years p,
But can it run Minecraft at highest settings Thats the true test,
Flash news roadster 20 and the new I phone xx are both selling at the same price point in 2020,
How long do the batteries work 5 years Is it comparable to an ICE,
If we can do 060 In 19 seconds how fast will we be in 2050,
The roadster is not a supercar Its a spacehip but on the road this acceleration is like a space hyperdrive mode,
Cant wait to buy this when I have the money in 30 years,
Buy 1 bitcoin now exchange for a tesla roadster in 2020 Its the best costbenefit youll see all day Youre welcome ,
if this thing is Rooted you can fly to the moon in 31 seconds,
People think the original roadster is actually good the Tesla SUV is faster,
I bet roadster would trash Nissan gtr jeep lambo Chevy and ferrari Oh I almost forgot dodge charger and challenger,
Im surprised nobody is talking about the 620 miles of range Like wtf how did they do this,
Ive started budgeting for it If I save 10 flip If I save 100 flip I cant afford it,
It better charge with usbc,
In 2020 I will be 18 and wont get this car 18 is the legal European age to drive a car,
Is it just me or does the Tesla look like Jiren from Dragonball Super,
Check his snapchat hes just reserved one,
Tesla  Every other auto manufacturer ever,
But does it consider rollout,
Id be dying if Tesla say they make a Lamborghini look alike 060 in 03 seconds,
How are you gonna compare a petrol engine to an electric motor and talk about acceleration,
We already know youre purchasing it,
We saw it coming Cars now have storage I bet air conditioners would have software update in a near future,
So what would 4 motors do Ill take the 4 motors,
You better have pressed that reserve button,
Tesla cars are the best Im looking at cars I want to get and I mostly care about it being electric over anything Great Video,
But can it record 4k video at 30fps,
tesla roaster 2 is a beast,
Should I should I I think I probably will Its Tesla guys if you have money  u just cant miss it,
19 sec  60mph 8 sec  14 and no notch,
are you marcus holloway from watch dogs 2,
But can it run Crysis 3,
im 15 right now and Im basically just going to base my life goals on being able to afford this car cant even imagine what will be out by the time i can afford this car,
That car ride from inside looked like hyperloop,
BRUH THIS IS NY DREAM CAR,
Im a truck driver and I look forward to that tesla semi truck  ,
The McLaren 720 will smoke the p100d but the new tesla roster is sick,
Hell put some slicks on that thing and hit the drag strip,
imagine the p200t or whatever would be the p100d of this PLUS its gutted AND modded yeah the fastest car in the world here folks,
So that thing can knock out a mile in 36 seconds,
Still thinking the truck is a waaaaay bigger deal than the roadster 20 even though it is impressive,
Sothe driver for that i just finished watching his video why i clicked on this one is Emile Bouret ebouret for instragram FYI,
Motor Trends  Worlds Greatest Drag Race 7 Tesla beats a handful of supercars,
Id like to see a tesla roadster in NASCAR,
Cant we use nuclear power For giving it maximum amount of energy,
GO GET IT D,

Great Scott That cars flux capacitor has 121 jiggawatts of power,
I Own a Tesla Roadster 20 Founders Edition i am not lying just telling the truth in advance Dream big and work towards your dream and you too can have what you desire  Love Tesla Cars,
Who else is excited to get a Tesla one day,
Have u seen the rimac concept 2 from Croatia Absolutely dominates the Tesla roadster,
Im not a huge car person but this is pretty cool My partner is super stoked and it was pretty entertaining to see how excited you were,
Nothing short of legendary,
Zippy is that his real voice,
Buy it Marques,
whats up with his right eyebrow,
Most of the highest end hypercars are more 0120 or 180 Of course those cars are works of art and collectable But the roadster is quite a thing,
Love your videos men and I am happy for you and your success in life Hope I get there one day soon too Cheers mate,
The way its accelerate looks unreal CGI kind of thing but ive to admit unexplainable is a real thing its happening,
Yeah you should order the roadster Then set up a subscriber meet and charge 5 dollars for a 060 ride You will make your money back in no time,
im honestly more excited about the Model 3 cause thats some i can afford lol But Tesla sure as hell r doing a great job right now,
But any countrys development is in their Folks hand,
Do these EVs have AC and or heating Do it dude  Push that button ,
FactMKBHD is not a truck driver,
Buy it buy it buy it buy it,
I think it will pay off to go 060mph in 16 seconds Thats really fast,
PUSH THE BUTTON BROTHER GET ONE,
Those specs sound down right illegal lmao imagine how a car chase between a regular police car and the tesla be,
This guy is one wrong person to be given free Tesla model S from Tesla  He is a great tech speaker but electric cars naaah  There are so many electric car enthusiast with great channels ,
I think you should order one for yourself Youre only live once so why not do it with style This car is sick but so are you Go go go,
200kw200000000j Aaww little much for a car,
Just do it,
The original roadster was from a Lotus Elise 111s,
That acceleration is like using the speedhack in old NFS games,
NIKOLA TESLA IS,
And thats the base model,
But can it cook meals for you I need a kitchen cause house I wont be buying,
For every three people who disliked this video 103 people liked it Good work Marques,
Tesla Roadster vs iPhone X coming out soon,
Mind numbing speed the range and charge rates are unbelievable I cant wait for the dash cam videos either its gonna be nuts Im too old for that kind of speed I cant even handle my Porsche 996 Turbos speed so Ill just have to enjoy other peoples videos and live vicariously Good job once again on this video keep them coming,
Car is freaking hot dude,
D E W I T ,
Lol just buy a Corvette way more fun per dollar and nothing sounds better than a V8,
060 in 19 is Formula 1 territory,
I think every car or tech enthusiast wants to see a review for this car,
It seems you maybe living a little Long on the finacial tooth 15M,
It smoked even Kawasaki ninja H2R acceleration,
ohits my dream car,
Press the button Marques,
But can it Crysis 3 8k240FPS,
But can it do this *leans back 180*,
Just make sure it has a cupholder And keep your lid on your coffee when you accelerate everybody,
32sec to the nearest mart,
now i cant wait to see what other brands will make from now on till 2020 this could very well be a trap from Tesla to make others evolve faster im calling it,
And here I am with my trusty old 1993 Honda accord I called it sparky Sparky is a good boy,
200 kWh battery is sweeeeeeet,
Well Hurray The Xmas is here and theres alot of New things at this New year 2018 i hope all Will have a happy holiday ,
Elon Musk is real life Tony Stark,
The front looks like the Lykan hypersport,
I feel that Apollo will soon be hurt by a trucker Edit 2 days laterNailed it 80,
how many quadro or volta titan xp for 200k,
Imagining some people that Elons idea of solar cars wouldnt work They probably shaving on their asses now And also that is really THE CAR,
I think the 250mph are even more crazy than the 19s I mean its an electric car and thats just crazy Also the car just doenst look like a car thats as fast as an Bugatti,
Fastquietless polluting Greatest electric carTop speed 210kmh130mphRange 400km250milesnow2020 models should be increaseTesla Roadster,
Probably gonna acquire the Roadster Youre funny Marques My DOG knows youve reserved one already Keep us informed,
Formula E seems to finally be paying off lolI think there gen 2 variant can reach over 280kmh,
Has to be the most overpriced production car on the face of the earth And wait you rented your Tesla Come one man,
Dom *You owe me a 10 second car* Elon *Hold my beer*,
massive dragster 19 Hold my beer,
Supra2nv is intrigued  Maybe I sell my Lexus for this v,
That the issue with these cars Electric cars needs more cooling cause when you pass 150 mph the motors lost power very fast Gas powered can hold they power better and not fade,
Stupid fast is now an obsolete term,
I click on this video at an acceleration of 060 in 19s,
My friend 88 14 is cake for Puerto Rican race teams who many teams hold countless records with cars in the low 7s high 6s,
Seeing that 060 number beginning with a 1 just makes my organs drop,
Its really hard to avoid anything on your channel Youre killing it Keep it up man Love the Telsa stuff,
For us the range is the most impressive D 1000km single charge,
RESERVE IT MAN YOUR CHANNEL IS SICK AND YOU DESERVE GREAT THINGS,
19  Alright im saving,
Imagine if it had a 120 Hz screen like the Razer Phone,
Of course the range will depend on how you drive,
MKBHD Is getting roadster 20 in 2020,
ZeroPointEnergy  Any Tesla Car  Infinity and beyond,
what if the new roadster will have a something like super edition and have a full carbon body And I really like the mazda like red color for the prototype,
musk once laughed when he was asked in an interview about how he deals with the competition,
Tesla should by Rimac so he can help work on this roadster project,
just go for it man buy it you have the passion and money for it,
I LOVE TESLA The 2020 Tesla Roadster is my Dream Car BETTER ThAN LAMBORGHINI EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A LAMBORGHINI LOGO THOUGH HAHAHA,
Battery 200kwh with technology lithium currently  800 kg LoL,
I heard that the higher end models comes with flux capacitors,
19 Seconds 89 Seconds 14 Mile Bye bye Dodge Demon,
Thumbnail dope,
This thing legit could go in a formula 1 race and do well,
I love your video Marques keep it up,
I dont know to Hit those kind of times youd have to sacrifice handling at that point 19 seconds youre talking about front tire lifting speed Even the 918 which delivers 950Ft lbs couldnt take down the Demon in the 14 mile and it was down in power and heavier by around ballpark 600700lbs Anything shy of 918 numbers and I dont see it happening,
You wanna be a man drive a real car not a double A battery,
The new Tesla Roadster is freaking insane This car kills everything I can see your mind just twisting trying to decide whether to buy it or not just do it,
19 seconds sound like 19 aperture ,
i have a tesla roadster that cost 250k,
They should focus on longer battery life for the cheaper models vs absolute speed in unaffordable ones,
Woah That tesla launch is crazy,
Tesla should make mobile batteries,
But dou see scratches at a level 6 and deeper groves at level 7 Rong channel Ok Ill leave,
The fastest Electric car in the world,
its only 250K its just like another mortgage,
Mkbhd do a video on if you are gonna get the Tesla roadster 20,
I cant wait to buy this thing all I need is a quarter million,
but will this beat the nio ep9 or rimac 2 round a track,
Plant launch far lovely plant section forest opening fun recover,

Will Smith MarkAss Brownie,

19 what is that ,
you can sing up on tesla website to rice the semi,
Lease that mofo Because in 2025 a 15s version is coming,
Luckily you are safe man But I would imagine that was damn frightening Having a truck cutting you up Emphasis on the cutting good luck man,
As an old friend of mine once said in a galaxy far far away Do it May the torque be with you,
Definitely my dream car rn,
I love your channel You post amazing content and I have never regretted hitting that Subscribe button Thank you Nowreserve that car so I can see your review in 2020,
A substandard sports car company trading on the name of a historical legend,
suggest tesla to make phone batteries,
Tesla Racing Channel nuff said that kid destroys muscle cars at the track,
MKBHD from reviewing dank software to having the option to reserve a roadster mans made it,
I enjoyed your justification,
Thanks for the proper pronunciation of the name Tesla,
Bro are you February guy,
Also no headphone jack C,
19 yes its fast but they sayd dis wil be the base model,
My dads 2005 Bentley will do 60 in 42 seconds This is insane,
Are these Teslas workable in states where winterheating is a part of driving,
Tesla Owners calling themselves a car guy,
RESERVE IT Do it,
Well in 2020 19 sec might not be that fast cuz now Porsche and Mercedes are testing their own electric cars that could go a 15,
Wow wow Im the biggest fan of yours in Bangladesh in the city Dhaka,
you must have already prebooked your Roadster ,
Good luck theyll be out of business before 2020 cant even build 10 of what theyve already sold,
Dont think Just do The Roadster 20 is INSANE,
dear tech youtubers how about a giveaway of the roadster,
060 in 19 seconds is the base model,
How do you say it speaks for itself I dont know youre right how do you end this theres no ending  its just the beginning,
But Im still wondering about the torque on this car It has a 10000 nm torque while a Lamborghini Aventador has a torque of about 760 nm How can this be And what difference will that make,
More exciting than anything Apple would ever do,
It doesnt ACTUALLY do 060 in 19 seconds though The convention is that the first foot of movement is not counted The timer starts after the first foot of movement Actual time is something like 2122 seconds Which is still REALLY quick,
And now ones flying through space on a rocket,
i havent been on this channel in a while and i must say DAM bro you grew up,
Specs are BS SpeculationTeslas favorite thing to do Lie to put his stock price up,
2020 Roadster gonna look great zipping around Mars ,
if you have 2 trade in Apollo have one of your friends buy it that way its close by n you can always buy it back if nostalgia gets the better of you keep up the great workpeace,
19 call the ambulance right now,
19 seconds The 2007 Honda did it in 15,
Elon is a guy this world wants we humans need,
Tesla roadster on a race track  Cars 3 IRL,
RIMAC C_two is better,
Keep in mind that that was just something he said Imagine a year and a half from now the specs may be EVEN BETTER than what it is now,
But still cannot beat the beast legendery toyota supra,
A supercharged Hurracan does 060 in 23s so I imagine how Lamborghini will try catch up with Tesla,
Fuels will never compete with electric The only way any other car manufacturer can compete with these numbers is to go electric,
Dude have you heard of ConceptOe,
Tesla Roadster and Bugatti Chiron are like OnePlus 5T and iPhone X,
Reserve one,
COME OOOON  Thats not even a question  Ofcause you should  and then drive it to Denmark and give a ride D,
not the fastest car BUGATTI,
Im incredibly excited to see the Tesla Roadster in action Great vehicle,
This hole video is Adlib Lol,
But lets see what Buick is doing,
Youre using Razer Phone P gotcha,
This is a whole new category  it needs to be enabled to fly now ,
Not giving credit to the music used in the video in description absolute mad lad,
Marques is going to go crazy when he get his own Roadster in 2020,
You forgot to mention to 10000 newtonmeters of torque For reference a Bugatti Veyron has 1500 If this thing had enough traction it could drag the Empire State Building into California obvious exaggeration but it can pull alot of weight,
Thats completely insane,
Pls buy me one,
Tesla Is The Future,
mirt ez a rohadt migrns tesztel ,
Can it survive a collision from a Nokia,
Thats a devilish car that nobody is going to be able to beat bye bye hyper car world Tesla taking over I think its going to even beat thee fastest Bugattis,
GTR Alpha 0 to 60 in 15 seconds,
Go for it,
PRICE Its going to be super expensive with those stats Nobody is commenting on that,
Here in Miami the roadster can go 060mph only as fast as the roadway of cars ahead of it Waiting for the Lilium,

Cant wait till we can go 160 in 01 seconds,
Nice cars I think God help me to win Iphone X please,
As someone who has admired Lamborghinis and Astons forever this is definitely a new crush,
That car looks badass Lets see regular gas car companies compete against this,
If u get it its like getting it for all of us *JUST DO IT*,
Ppl drag race with Teslas anyway This would just be trolling,
Great video but can we talk about how FIRE the opening song is,
These numbers are just insane Damn Elon you naaaasty,

Nice review I like your comparisons,
I always enjoy watching your videos,
When will Tesla replace NASCAR,
Its not gonna be the 250k price promised but 350k for the 1st release just like the Model 3 only 50k for 1st release no 35k price for a while,
I just have a question If you look at the front of the car there is no clear opening to a front trunk Do you think that that space will be used for battery or other equipment,
Lots of extreme specs and beautiful too This roadster is going to be one hot vixen Wives are gonna be jealous,
Cant wait too see this on a drag strip,
Dope video and yes you Have to reserve one of them,
You did already order it,
Can you find out what the extra 50k founders Have vs regular ones,
Like a steam engine with side of quiche,
Thats a hefty price gotta decide on either the roadster or the 2020 iphone,
Man walks on stage like he built it smh,
I play Vehicle simulator on roblox so I knew about it,
Will be buying just to see how feels to go that fast Not much into cars also for environmental reasons but this will be fun,
*Why is nobody talking about the 10000 nm of TORQUE* man it blows my mind I cant think about it,
Elon explained in an interview that they usually set the release dates at an almost unrealistic time to make the team more productive but we can only hope 2020,
I never liked Tesla but now I love Tesla,
MKBHD have you ever try to get in touch with Mate Rimac  RIMAC company Maybe to make Concept One 2 video review,
You love Tesla and their products are great so have faith that the roadster will also be great and buylease it,
Any iPhone SE users in 2019,
Im still using morse code Its cheaper,
Whos is getting a iphone se in 2018,
Iphone se in 2019 4 me,
Its 2019 and the iPhone SE is still running the latest version of iOS like a champ,
I just went from a 6 to a se Its faster and battery last way longer The camera is 12 mp not 8 like my 6 Its basically a 6s in a smaller phone I love it So it was technically a upgrade for my 6,
iPhone SE is powerful,

tbh i think this phone would be good for kids cus nowadays everybody wants the 6 and 7 and its soooo annoying but this phone is good cus its like a mini iphone 6,
I think iphone 5 SE strong than iphone 6,
iPhone se is easier to hold thats why I want the iPhone se over iPhone x,

Watching on the IPhone SE,
What a great way to confuse people Great job apple,
I prefer 5 SE than 6 ,
I want this rather than the 8,
phone SE super,
The iPhone SE is the best small and looking Phone ever Even better than the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus I bought it yesterday and it looks much better than I tought it would be,
The iPhone 5s and SE are the best looking iPhones ever imo the 6 and 6s are ugly,
I just got mine today Its works really good I LOVE IT,
I wish they made a new 43 inch with a better front camera and Touch ID instead of the SE,
Actually the chamfered edge on a 5S isnt matte finished its more glossy shiny,
Id be fine with the old design if it had second gen touch id and force touch,
Hi sorry for bad english,
Whos watching on a se,
Im watching it on SE 128GB Space Grey,
Im getting the iPhone SE rose gold soon Happy to hear this is good value,
Is it important weather I choose 16gb or 32gb ,
Im coming from an iPhone 7 plus and now have the SEI genuinely dont see this as a downgradeLOVE ITnot regretting it at allx,
iphone SE is really good than 6S model because it is really faster in its track buddy the best is having it cause of its compact size too,
I dont know why people keep saying that this iPhone is so small Its what iPhones WERE and what they were always meant to be,
Who design this Why i never bore to see this design,
iPhone SE S Same E Edition,
Whats your rate of it out of 10 Me *dunno never had it but soon will* Srsly whats your ratings,
Ive had it for a few days and its definitely worth a look,
I have had an iPhone 6 for 2 years and in many ways I like the 5 which this is in design more This is the last iPhone Steve Jobs was directly involved in making,
Rip my iPhone 4s 8 gig 1 like  1 prayer,
Who else watching on SE,
I like small phones because I have big hands It makes it very easy to use with one hand,
This is for my classmate He has baby hands,
those edges are perfect for scratching your back with ,

that sad moment when everyone say i got iphone and i am here using samasung 2016,
Still using it in 2019,
Its all fun and games until the IPhone SE II comes out and has the power of an Iphone 7s but in a 6s body and comes with 24Gb of storage,
i always like your review and im getting this iphone in 2017 hehehe,
Now its free at metro pcs if u are switching,
I want this phone so bad Looks much better than 6s  Even my 7,
Yo Marquez please do a review on the iPhone SE in 2018,
God I really want this phone so much 3,
I have a 64g iphone 6 and even that isnt enough storage for meidk how ppl have 16g phones,
Its called 3d touch,
To those who are thinking of getting an Iphone SE let me tell you you will not be disappointed I just bought one and its awesome It works really well software is amazing the built quality feels very premium The battery life is very very good If your not a major gamer and you use the phone for business purposes your phone can last you over a day I used to own a midrange phone the ASUS Zenfone 6 with a 3300 mah battery and I can tell you for a fact that the Iphone SE battery lasts much longer Its really all depends on how efficient the entire system is and because the Iphone is very efficient Apple doesnt need to stuff a large battery for the phone to last a day I have seen some reviews wherein the Iphone SE battery lasts longer than the S7 The camera quality is great both for front and back Dont get confused by the over super detailed comparison between the photo quality of the Iphone SE to other other phones In real life usage you wont even see any difference The only thing I can see why this phone will discourage some people is because of the screen size Thats all everything else works so well Games work smoothly even the high graphic games work smoothly Despite the screen being small it really doesnt affect game play Even typing is not difficulty My old phone was 6 inches and I shifted to 4 inches and I dont regret one bit The price of this phone is similar to the Samsung Aseries and believe me the Iphone SE feels more premium and works more fluid I used to only have Android Phones and the Iphone SE is my first Iphone and I know realize how big the difference is between Iphone and the rest of the pack ,
Its 199 On MetroPCS Right Now,
What people like about the iPhone SE Smaller design for those who want small Almost half the price of the newer iPhones but with the same internal designs,
Iphone S smaller E edition Edit I know this comment is very late,
Hey Marques I like your videos You Michael Fisher and Jason Vergara are my favorite tech youtubers,

I do like mine a lot The screen is a pain in the ass though To watch or play my content,
Awesome review dude This was an enjoyable watch Thank you,
Rather get the sony xperia xz2 compact,
Currently watching this on the iPhone SE with 1440p worth it,
Just watching this because intro No iphones in my house,
I am getting an SE tomorrow as a christmas present So I am just wanting to see if it is good at all,
God  Youve got really big palms Or is it a relative effect due to SE,
I honestly hate Apple products but once I saw the iPhone 5 and 5s I fell in love with the design It looks so elegant and emphasizes simplicity that it immediately captured my attention Now in using both Android and Apple ,
Rose Gold looks a lot nicer on the SE than the 6s,
I wish I had a bald Kenyan dindoo phone They capture the sickest moving images and hilarious too They take the barbs off cos theyre krool x,
s speed eedition  why iphone 5s6s are launched because S  series is just for speed,
Marques got some really big hands  ,
Does anyone pay attention to HOW BIG HIS HANDS ARE,
My parents are still using the iPhone 4 with no issue Reason people like Apple Simplicity good technical support and reliability,
Thanks found what I was looking for,
im gonna buy it in a month,
Stunning Video quality I dont think any other smartphone reviewer on Youtube uses such Ultra highquality cameras for reviewing a cell phone Amazing,
108 Actually I can name 4 things that are different 1 The edge finish is matte while it is not on the 5S 2 SE lettering on the back 3The Apple logo is stainless steel instead of printed on 4 Rose Gold color,
iPhone SE Same Edition,
how is the battery life how many hours of screen on time,
Im getting it idc rly about the screen size its the best value from apple and I like iOS more than android so,
Buy in December 2018 my first iPhone  small beast supper fast,
This is currently the only good looking iPhone in production What happened,
Watching this from my new SE,
Switching from an HTC desire 626s to iPhone SE Next month or so I hope I like the IPhone SE,
400 heck no Free from giveaway Heck yes,
Definitely not my cup of tea but I do know people that would consider this a blessing,
I love that compact 4 screen No need for bigger one,
getting this for my birthday in gold and it looks amazing,
to all people who still dont know what SE stands for it means six ess or 6s,
The SE is only 159 with boost mobile Its worth it ESP if you want a small high end phone,
I think the iPhone 5 is the skinniness I would go when manufacturing a phone because not all people like a Flatscreen TV in their pocket,
wrong se means SAME EVERYTHING,
Will I update my one to iOS 10 I am scared because of storage and battery life,
Comparable newer and faster phone For 13 the price Moto g4 play,
2018and Im buying it as a backup,
The story of creating iPhone SE Jonathan Ive Tim theres a lot of iPhone 5S bodies left What should we do Tim Cook Hmm Lets change few specs inside and tell peoples its completly new phone  Profit ,
This iPhone is the best I have this iPhone Is working rrally good and its worth it when I listen to max music the sound its the best quality The screen is smoothcute and little Im rating this masterpiece over 10 stars I have it on rose gold too lol,
THIS 534 is my favorite part of the vid,
*Guy great for small hands* *me this phone is for me*,
According to this smartphone is a smartphone that suits me Because it is not too heavy to carry and the important thing really nice I feel,
Who else is watching this on a rose gold iPhone SE,
Easy geometry  square shape  less fumbling less broken phone,
im getting one soon is that a good decision,
Its a good phone Im using it right now not bad its fast too,
Is too small I hope its useable in 2019,
Is too small I hope its useable in 2019,
The old Moto X filled this niche until they kept making it bigger every year Now its gigantic and I hate it Also they went to IPS from AMOLED AMOLED was awesome,
The SE Is my first Iphone ever D Nice review,
I recommend if you want a iphone get the SECOND,
Correction Marques its the 5S body not the 5 body,
Theres a 64 gig its 50 more tho,
Theres a 64 gig its 50 more tho,
If u go to MetroPCS rn u can get this phone free when u switch and pay for a unlimited data plan for 50 I forgot to mention that its a 35gb phone its a very good deal,
I love this phone because I bought it last year 2017 and last square design and the colour,
WHO THINKS HES PURE AWESOMENESS,
extremely Stunning Iphone SE,
At least the phone is recyclable,
MKBHD haha just a silly qn how to you keep all the phones in a standing position on table i cant do it with moto g  op3t how do you manage to do that,
THEY STILL HAD ENOUGH SPACE FOR A HEADPHONE JACK,
I think Apple ran out of design ideas tbh,
if people are so obsessed w big phones why not buy a tablet and walk around w it cell phones are ment to be small and portable not a big 810 inch phone that can barely fit in your pockets,
So glad I bought one They made a SMALLER iPhone I love it,
Im getting this same exact phone in 2 weeks Im excited,
Ive got a 5s,
Any one having this Problem Playback Error  Tap to Retry  ,
Great video looking to purchase this smaller phone,

Good review thanks But the body has a matte finish on the sides which differs from the 5s FYI,
Watch Samsung start making smaller phones with high end specs once Apple sells tons of these,
The old Instagram logo and design,
My tech teacher showed this to us and Im getting one,
I finally got mines I got it at metro pcs for 225,
Which colour you prefer the most  space grey or rose gold in ip SE ,
I just picked one up 64gb space grey Timeless design and one hand usability I was using an iPhone 6plus gold It makes wonder why we got brain washed to use 55 inch displays The se feels great in hand and if I want to consume media Ill grab the iPad Air 2,
A year later IPhone SE is running quick,
its student edition,
One of the only genuine reviewer  Keep rolling Love from INDIA,

Two years since I got my SE and there is still no real alternative on the market Come on Apple its time for the SE 2,
Ill be buying this phone very soon Ive always wanted an iPhone but I couldnt ever afford to buy one But now I can ,
Thought about getting an iPhone again Last one I had was trash Been with an Android since and couldnt be happier Never one problem with it Bout to try another one of these Really hope I dont regret it,
it have image stabilisation on the camera hows its quality,
What he was talking about small phones and said he couldnt do it as a daily driver but understands why people like it I feel the EXACT same way about big phones lol,
I would only like Iphones if I had a repair service shop Id make a lot of money repairing all these connectors speakers microphones batteries wifi of Iphones,

Ahhhh Ahh thats hot Thats hot,
I was watching on an iPhone SE,
if you didnt Know what SE means it mean still expensive,
Perfect for people with small hands Who has small hands people,
I dont understand why people calling it SE Stupid Edition I mean come on guys if you want big display then buy the 6 plus Simple and plain Dont complain for a phone that is not made for you People who has small grip and prefer smaller phone need this And to those who say this is just an iPhone 5 with upgraded specs come on guys thats why it is called iPhone SE not iPhone 5 coz they have different specs lol,
I have an iPhone 5se in 2017,
My first iPhone in 2019 I didnt need anything crazy because its just for business Google Pixel 2 XL will still be my main phone,
best phone ive ever had been using it for almost 30 mins but still retained its 99 battery,
Congrats on 7m subs,

vr v Lrun,
357 PHONE SNATCHED,
rip my 8 gig tablet,
I want this design in a 55 inch phone,
after using a LG G4 for the past 2 years I bought a SE yesterday to replace it It may not be the latest and greatest but it is definitely a great functional device at a reasonable price with a great 4K camera and a very business style form factor Plus even if I lose it at the airport it wont break the bank Underrated device,
thank you brother ,
Hey what do you think of the upcoming se2 Will it be better than the X How much will it cost,
Just got this phone brand new for 157 what a great price for such a good phone,
Like that intro beat,
027 dog shaming book lol,
I just got the se but in the 2 days Ive had it I love it fingerprint lock great graphics and perfect for gaming and very portable and comfortable to hold 3,

Couldnt care less for the phone just watching for that MKHB videography,
Sorry dont know how to do this but my se still takes great photos how do i put a photo up on here,
Watching on my se still love it,
I would only consider it if it had force touch Best thing on a phone rhynw,
Why is it 60 dollars more in the UK,
Still using an iPhone SE,
BACK CAMERA BETTER THAN MOTO G5 or not,
Should if its at the price for 229 dollars 8G per month of data and 64g for the phone itself I think its a really good deal,
Well only 4K okay *cry in the corner,
not gonna make too big of a deal of it but at 225 that is NOT a 2x4 thats a 7 x 34 pine plank also in a totally not biasedinanyway kinda way this is def the best video youve ever made,
MKBHD Studio Clean Minimalism Casey Neistat Studio Organized Chaos,
Casey  This is the cheapest tv I could get Looks Good though Marques  This is the most expensive tv available It still isnt Good,
Marques new series 6 months later 1 video,
This is NASA Space Station Studio Tour,
Whats the Electricity Bill,
The studio is filled with lights and so he doesnt take off his shades Cooolll,
How does he keep everything clean from dust,
Thats the best studioman cave ever,
It looks lika a 21st century mad scientist lab I love it ,
Linus should hook him up with a Stornator,
Imagine he got robbed What if he has to move out,
MKBHD quality of Casey VS himself videoing Such a difference,
Go pro security,
If power ever goes out in NY you guys know why,
Casey is that one guy in the math problems with all those red tool boxes,
Id see his Electricity bill,
Man cant spell propellers,
That supreme bag low key hypebeast flex,
I WONDER WHAT HIS MONTHLY ELECTRIC BILL LOOK LIKE,
Love this collab between 2 YouTube rockstars,
Who came here after watching unbox therapys Stadio,
WHERE IS EPISODE 2 MARQUES ,
150 terabytes of storage my 600 laptop only has 1 terabyte,
A more efficient use of space than a HTC U UltraJust saying ,
Reminds me of an earthbased ISS  every wall space maximally utilized ,
Hes even cooler than I thought,
The gadget man,
I only have one question how much does this and the electricity bill cost,
hes like an organized Horder,
aNd ThE SeCoNd ViDeO oF tHiS sErIEs CoMeS NoW,
No one People who live in New York,
The minimalist in me is suffering an anxiety attack watching this video,
LoL What if his studio burns up or catches firehe would probablyumm,
150tb of storage *Linus laughs in background*,
This was the first video in which I saw casey and now i watch all of his vlogs and if i get time i watch his old vlogs also,
He should sell his apartment in Griniche village and make that back room his house,
If this place gets robbed Thats a lot of damage chief,
Tasty knife set and his hyper functional studio,
he spends more on electricity bill then i earn a month,
2 of my favorite YouTubers linking up Love how his studio is a true example of organized Chaos Keep making awesome content man Much Love,
Imagine the electricity bill,
He look so granpa,
Well lit,
The most organized hoarder that ever existed ,
Tool construction workshop area ADJECTIIIIIIIIVVVVEEEESSS Not hating btw,
Lets say that he is preparing for a zombie apocalypse,
Awesome Always love seeing my favorite YouTubers collab especially you guys Wonder whos gonna be next,
crashed drone into Central Park pond These things happen,
HTC should learn from Casey just to avoid poor use of space,
Great video  thank you so much for posting Build over Buy and more organized than it looks  love it xWBW,
Yo MKBHD probably an unorthodox question but do you edit the audio before the video or togetherafter Fan from SG here,
holy god this is straight heaven besides all the tech and camera gear  just that organization,
Great video Its always interesting seeing another persons personal workplace A collaboration between you and Mr Mobile would be very interesting,
How does he keep his whole office clean There must be a lot of dust accmulation,
Marques this is my favorite video youve ever made Ive been waiting for more entries in this series for so long,
Imagine stumbling across this studio in The Last of Us Part II or something,
some of my favourite YouTubers together Yes please Thanks for sharing and making this amazing video The flow voice overs and visuals were all amazing,
I am not hating but I really wonder why he uses the RED camera when other youtubers like Peter Mckinnon get better looking footage with a dslr Even with all the specs and gear the cinematography is just not that great,
Casey is an artist I really believe that in 50 years his studio will be a museum,
linustech should make a storage server with Casey,
1 How does he deal with dust 2 What is the average temperature in the studio and does he vent it It is perfect and he owns it in the way Guy Ritchie explained the term,
You better sell it quickly before it becomes junk I lost money keeping stuff like that,
His electricity bill must be massive,
Watching this in September 2018 you should make an up to date tour,
Imagine someone opened the dor at it was a robber *BRING UT BOYS*,
Just loved it I love how he has managed and arranged everything perfectly Very Desciplined,
Love the vid man The cinematography is great The audio is great too Keep doing what your doing You deserve more subs btw,
I love how you are always doing new series and stuff on the channel to renew it  you dont just stick to regular smartphone reviews keep going,
HIs sTUDIO IS lIKE MAn Cave for Super spy DAMN,
This is National Art men Your watching a mastet masterpiece,
I love how crispy and well edited all your footage and audio is keep pushing the great content bro,
Im loving the idea of making studio tour of other youtubers Im hoping for some more Love it,
Also imagine hoarding on all those fabulous tech and not doing anything worthwhile with it I mean rent it sell it give it hack it but do something of all these goods that amount to shittons of CO2 emission btw goddamit,
Lol Says the MacPro is too slow to edit on and then uses a 2016 MacBook Pro,
Imagine if he had to move offices,
Hes definitely got the Drug Dealer who gets high and gets way too organisedparanoid on a 6 day bender vibe going on for sure P,
Great video man I love how you experiment with your videos by giving each one a different kind of flavor slightly different opening music ending shotspanning,
Bro youre videos always make me smile Thats no small thing,
Who else saw it on Caseys vlog,
Great idea doing this Marques Caseys studio is awesome and I hope yours  mines become that awesome 1 day,
MKBHD part 2 men Not all part of the studio is covered in this video,
I wonder how much Caseys utility bill is,
Cant beat linus thojk his office is a literal tornado wreck,
Then I see my bedroom and its just a bed and a drawer ,
Total value cost in the studio more than 1M Casey U r Rockstar dude,
Call Linus for the storage,
I am an Engineer and I like the way he organizes things is not the by the book but that is exactly the way I labelled everything in the Factory and guess what we increase productivity by 135,
Amazing video Thanks for giving us a glimpse into the world of Casey Neistat Ive always wondered how that crazy room functioned WOW,
Casey is like a mad scientist  a genius rolled into one ,
Love the collab and awesome camerawork as always,
This is such an awesome video Seeing one youtubers studio from the perspective of another is such a refreshing change compared to all of the Studio Tours out there WE WANT MOAR,
I wonder what studio MKBHD will go to next I NEED MORE OF THIS It needs to be PhilyD sometime Hes moving office spaces right now,
Inbox Theraphy  Jonathan Morrisons studio next Or Mr Mobile Studio,
Damn hes living like Jason Bourne,
Im slowly becoming a fan of Neistat despite his politics but I have to say I love his studio,
how much are his electricity bills A lot I bet,
Square footage ,
What a Great Video Marques Bravo,
All those lights No wonder he wears sunglasses all the time,
This was much more interesting than i anticipated Great vid Cool studio,
I think he could survive Zombie apocalypse,
i always loved the studio of waiting for this type of video thanks,
Hi Casey i really enjoy your work i watch your movies often your so amazing im a grand mother to four grandsons my oldest is about to turn 12 your a fantastic roll model thank you so much for what you do god bless you x,
Seems like a rich use of space,
That was an awesome video Marques Really enjoyed it Keep making more like this Cheers,
Thats a really interesting studio wtf Huge spacious and utilised amazingly,
Hey Marques great quality video as usual Watching you since I first got into tech a few years ago and seeing you branch out to other creators studios really opened my eyes about what I should do with my own creativity heading into college Cheers,
I love you guys both and I think this new series is absolutely amazing,
The real reason Casey lights his whole studio is to keep the Boogey Man away,
hey your vids are always top notch and I like your original ideas you should make one about mrmobile,
Imagine someone breaking up in this studio,
Seriously MKBHD Thanks for introducing me to CaseyNeistat He is awesome I see his vids all day long I just love him,
That RED footage looks amazing,
This is a 65 TV this is the cheapest TV I could find on amazon dead,
Ive been watching Caseys videos for years Ive seen this studio hundreds of times It still amazes me,
i respect casey because he can manage all the things inside his place and organize all of them and put a label on every thing respect you bro I LIKE YOUR VIDEO,
Propellars Great video and great studio,
This video series is genius please do more D,
MKBHD and Casey Is this a dream,
Shoutout to the mac pro the delorian of computers,

Awesome video Marques Im really excited to see the next episode This is a great and unique idea,
i can imagine the electric bill jesus,
Sorry Marques but I kinda am digging the aesthetic and wellsupplied messyneat vibe of this studio In a way it feels like a Minecraft survival base when you are at the end of the game Idk its pretty cool tho,
Been waiting for this lovely setup,
His work shop is awesome I totally dig the controlled chaos and organization,
*JUST REALISE I CANT EVEN AFFORD A PACK OF CHEETOS*,
How do you backup 100 TB,
He edits on a laptop rather than a more powerful desktop,
THIS IS STUDIO GOALS  TBH *FIRE*,
Hey Mkbhd digging the studio vids Im excited to see whats next casesys was epic,
This is a beautiful studio setup I want to redo my setup again,
now we need some of these for linus unbox T Austin and MKBHD,
THIS IS ONE PARANOID DUDE,
This is the most interesting video Ive ever seen Just Loved That Simplicity,
In short *His studio is LIT asf*,
I would love to be more of a buildoverbuy type of guy I dont have the engineering smarts or hardware to do it but I would love to become more practical and handy,
This is definitely one of my favorite videos from you guys good job,
Stunningly unique studio Thanks for sharing guys,
Really enjoyed how you explained every last detail with a great level of intricacy Really answered all the question I had as soon as they popped into my head Great video,
He shouldnt have toured Caseys place for his first episode I cant imagine any other YouTubers workplace being better than this Now all the other tours he will do will seem kinda boring ,
Love how his setup is sooo wabisabi but equally so structured and organized This man is a real artist,
I think Linus should help him as well to setup a fileserver,
The visible wire and cable setup may not be as clean but its highly functional I like it,
Hes literally a scrap batman In a good way,
WOW You edited that really fast who else wasnt expecting this video til tomorrow,
wow the altimate tour set up Mkbdnicestudio casyNeistat,
I love his studionever thought it wasnt organisedquite the contrary actually,
Wer kommt von Izzi,
I did not follow Casey Neistats YouTube channel but this video made me subscribe to his channel I very good way to expand and share YouTube fan base,
Damn Casey is the Bruce Wayne of film making what a collection,
In This Picks What would u Suggest  Honor 6x or LeEco 2,
wonder how much he pays for electricity,
I cant stack my boxes that high living in California due to earthquakes Also his studio gives me anxiety,
A bit of a perfectionist sometimes What ,
Tour unbox therapy next,
Literally a studio where Casey works,
The ultimate minimalist Awesome,
Who noticed J Coles song in the background,
LOL wow you guys have all these techs for recording and Im just using my LG G6 for recording LOLOLOLOLOL,
I think all his stuff in that single studio costs a wholetown,
What an awesome studio Definitely breeds creativity,
thanks for the presentation I like how the place looks like my style all ready to use,
He looks like a hard working man an independent dude Hes no wanna be thats fosure,
Great vlog I just did my first vlog where I traveled from Chicago to New York to go to an Event INSIDE the BEME office It was an amzaing trip Keep up the great work,
Sorry youtube MKBHD first then others,
This is the first time I hear about this video guess it didnt show in my sub box glad you mentioned in the newest video,
Hi Marques I really would like to see more collaboration between Casey and you Peace,
Props man Great video,
Wow so many GB of storage to be organized Its time to call Linus xD,
What if Landlord comes in and says sorry Casey you have to empty the space,
Loved it Do more like these  The editing is bomb  Do a tutorial on how to edit maybe ,
This is perhaps the best tour video Ive ever seen on YouTube Outstanding,
Im surprised Linus hasnt hooked Casey up with a Storinator,
You should do more like these this was cool Marques,
258 Circular diffusers LOL sounds much more sophisticated than Chinese lampshades,
That was amazing Seriously awesome stuff both of you,
*WHY KEEP BROKEN DRONESCAMERAS*,
Casey is gonna swet when he is asked to shift the office,
this studio is like adam savage cave but all about video,
409 ouhhh do i see a pineapple sticker on the right D,
Love the new series about the creative workshops of other youtubers Keep it up,
Caseys studio is like my file system everything is clearly labeled and placed with a reason,
my two favorite YouTubers in one vid,
How much is dat electricity bill,
636 This man is a freakin Legend Lmao,
totally love this keep making such videos,
Do unbox therapys studio,
Holy shit I swear Marques newest video keeps becoming my favorite of his,
Are you going to continue with this series it was a pretty dope idea,
when you label a box sewing machine oil  bungee rope you know you succeeded in life,
This man got the best office among every YouTuber,
Looks like his studio was designed by some of the Pimp my ride mechanics So much tv screens,
casey has that watch dog 2 hideout,
Deadmau5 studio tour next time ,
This is very informative,
Great inside vlog of CNs studio what an amazing buitifull space hes made for himself,
When do you continue this series,
How do you clean the dust in the office,
How does he have a 2600 cam laying around for table shots and not have a proper computer,
Omg CLUTCH,
Both of you are so admirable,
Im so glad you made this video Id been wanting to see a more indepth look at his space for a while So awesome how hes found all these intuitive ways to organize everything I really dig it,
Htc ultra what a waste of space *next episode Casey Neistat  what a use of space,
Really enjoyed this vid Thanks for sharing,
MKBHD Great use of space,
Studio Goals,
take my salam from bangladesh,
Who came here after watching Caseys vlog,
Did anyone else notice the supreme backpack at 420,
Great Job Would love to see such more videos,
This video has changed my life It opened me up to the world of Casey and took my content creation from just podcasting to the world of video Thank you Marques,
Thanks was always curious about hes set up Fire hazard though,
Two of my favorite YouTubers in one video ,
Hes an inspiration to minimalists everywhere,
One word HOLY SHIT Oh thats by the way two,
u nas sie na to mwi niezy pierdolnik,
Casey Neistat is an amazing compulsive tec hoarder,
Looks like a fire waiting to happen,
Whos here after seeing unbox therapy studio tour,
I dont wanna think about how much that electricity bill is,
THE BEAT FOR CHANGE BY JCOL MADE THIS GOOD LORD I LOVE YOU,
808 PROPELARS xD,
Please keep doing more of these studio tours It was so cool to see how other people have set ups His stuff seems so out of place but its all functional I loved it Thanks MKBHD,
DAYYUM  this studio is GOALS ,
the cables of his charging station tho amazing,
I never delete any footage  except accidentally,
while shooting the vlog 1 drive and vlog 2 drive he says he suspects his storage will be growing soon next few days and Casey announces the vlog is backi see,
Why not Linus  ,
Please do Peter McKinnons studio next,
This is nicea bit intimidating though too Makes an aspiring Tuber like me consider throwing in the towel This seems like a big time version of Karl Conrads Geared Out series Very nice ,
Whats up with propellars,
DO A UNBOX THERAPY STUDIO TOUR,
finallywe can see fred flinstones cave,
Finally Caseys studio is properly immortalized Great job,
over a year later and i still wonder why linus hasnt made a collab video with casey to get a backup  storage solution in place,
From New Jersey to New York this is as refreshing as it gets Love them,
I wonder how much the electricity bill is for this studio every month ,
Build VS buy And Im neither just use what I have laying around ha,
omg CaseyNeistat please giveaway one of those cool ass cameras,
The quality of tgis is amazing,
aka ,
Wow His electric bill must be stupid ridiculous Con Edison says cha ching,
So how much is his electricityif you know commment itttt,
PROPELLARS are actually correctly spelled propellErs,
Pls CaseyNeistat release your electric bill,
EPIC Collab 3,
Damn that studio is dope,
wowhhhoooh just loved it inspires a lot,
Whys he so paranoid about surveillance,
Its amazing how many times I can watch this video without getting bored of it,
This is one of those videos that you like before watching,
Do more of these I think its really cool,
Wow this makes me so anxious and irrate I am a minimalist Would throw out all these things or sell them then keep 1 desk 1 chair 1 camera and 1 charger,
Amazing I wonder how long it took him to get it to that state of perfect organization,
This is easaly one of your best videos The way you presented casey neistats studio was very interesting and entertaining Im hyped to see more videos like this keep up the good work,
150 terabytes Damn my computer barely has 25gb,
457 So Casey is gonna be the next youtuber to be visited by Linus so he could give them a better storage solution,
Need an LTT studio tour and server build now,
He like the Tony Stark of Vloggers,
Does he also store 247 recording cctv,
I never realized it beforebut this is like the Bat Cave but Casey style,
whats the song name for the instrumental,
M8 wtf so much tech and he edits with no mouse,
When your so messy but still so organized,
i wonder how much he pays for electricity,
Best Tech Reviewer  Best Vlogger Am I dreaming,
Linus should help casy with the storage,
Blown away with Caseys organisation Mental Man Seriously Cooooooool definitely gonna be using some of these to organise my space as well,
Please do unbox therapy studio tour,
Adam Savage testedcom Collaboration Please xDD,
You gotta admit Casey is one of the coolest guys ever,
Nice James Bond like of a studio,
You own supreme backpack lol,
YOU NEED A 150 FROM LTT,
Always loved the studio,
Dat intro tho,
Casey I recently starting watching your video and your video are awesome,
so basically half of the place is filled with junk,
I just became a new Ace Hardware sales associate I hope to achieve a studio lab as Great as this,
mkbhd This is an electric bomb One spark and tzzttzzzztkabooom,
who else loves this kind of studios than clean ones,
Whos agree if mkbhd do tour to unbox therapy studio,
423 Now thats a real chair not those fast cars type seats,
903 just wastage of electricity,
Infinite Warfare NOT a sponser,
I like this new series idea,
congrats for 6M MKB,
Oh my good como he arribado asta aki,
When are you doing another episode for this series Long overdue,
Caseys studio looks better in your videos Love the colour framesshots One word Crisp,
wtf did he do that he needs so much video surveillance,
his electricity bill must be massive to run all that,
638 is that a gopro karma Those had a manditory recall In the top right corner,
Im just imagining his electric bills,
*Top Ten Anime Crossovers*,
Why no mention of Tom Sachs,
Weve seen this tour of his studio so many times already Getting old smh,
Some pronounce it as gif others say gif but the correct way is gif,
This gentleman is so good at his job that I just watched a 12 minutes video and it felt like a 2 minute video Great job from the content all the way to editing Clean refreshing and eloquent style 5 out of 5 stars,
the front part of S8 is like something from the futureHalf the month of October is done and still no phone in the market that looks better than this damn Galaxy S8,
2019 Plz dont say im the only tech addict rewatching al old videos about smartphones,
Im an apple sheep but this phone is gorgeous,
Im taking Samsung im kinda bored of these iPhones,
Man I love playing with this phone at work My 6sPlus is boring its reliable but dammit Its lame,
Who else is here after seing the disappointment that was the iPhone X,
My s8 charges from 20 to 100 in 45 mins,
Why other flagship dont have curved screen I am fan of curved edges,
This phone is at least 3 years ahead of the I phone X,
Anyone here in 2019,
Who else feels like apple ran out of ideas so they made the iphone X,
Who else is Watching on theyre s8S8 plus,
2 min silence for those who sold their kidney for iphone 7,
You leaked youre phone number in 147,
All I gotta do now is wait till 2019 for the price to go down to a price I can comfortably afford 735 days guys 735 days,
Can I use bixby to buy the Empire State Building,
Put your screen level at 50 and you save big in battery life,
Wow just got the S8 and I got the impression that the fingerprint sensor would be a deal breaker but it feels like its almost center not a big deal,
This is actually the best smartphone of 2017 Its better than iPhone X and costs less than it,
Im watching this vid on my S8 D,
The phones battery is great i watch youtube for hours and it still has battery life,
Watching this on my iphone x Honestly apple still behind tech,
IOS is like living in a huge mansion but you are not allowed to step outside Android is like you are living in a real world with full freedom but we all know the real world isnt perfect so gotta find a sweet spot,
The most awesome phone everperiod,
Lets be real who tf is using their phones speaker to listen to high quality music thats why we have Bluetooth speakers and head phones,
The GIF maker  goddamnit,
Lots of times people forget their phone and need to make a call I say here use mine Their first words are Wow this is a really nice phone I say yeah its a Galaxy S8,
Anyone rewatching after the S10 video,
Here after watching S9 review Almost the same ,
Anyone know what the wallpaper is please,
Officially making the change from iPhone to Samsung,
Just got it today Goodbye Samsung S3 Hello Samsung S8,
This my best phone up till date Still rocking my s8 plus,
Who else is here after seeing the disappointment that was the Pixel 2,
is that a HEADPHONE JACK Im sold,
The day we get a truly 100 bezelless phone both front and back the day D Brand dies,
It took me some timebut I finally moved from Appleand it was the best tech choice of my life  This phone is amazingApple is 4 years behind,
Coming back two years later well it was an ultimate smartphone People still use this phone and but it as a mid ranger and are having absolutely no problems,
Someon who questions this phones performancefeel free to buy this oneI have been using this for the past 15 yr and no hicuups so far,
I like s8 is 2k17 flagship,
I swear to God Im watching this on a note edge,
Top lad u are the best reviewer on the box 10 10 keep up the good work,
This was my second phone upgrade from my j7 now own the s9 plus,
Nova launcher is mandatory D,
who else is watching this on their Samsung galaxy s8,
I am watching this video from my galaxy s8 from india kerala Nice phone,
Damn smartphones have come a long way look at them now,
Having an s10 the s8 looks old lol,
I already dropped my s8 and now its cracked at the bottom and top corners,
I really dont mind the fingerprint scanner,
Still worth to buy today Oct 2018 thanks,
Got an S8 plus Itll last me 4 more years before upgrading,
wallpaper  where can I find it ,
Works perfectly with One UI having the Exynos cpu,
So if the phone is almost there can I pay them almost the money,
I love android and Apple Gotta switch it up occasionally,
Great quality review as always Marques Your review convinced me to purchase my beautiful S8thank you,
Seeing this video in my s8 plus,
Already saw couple of reviews of the S8  whos also watching just for his quality video D,
Who is here from 2k19,
Im watching this on an s9 lol,
As great as this phone is I wish they kept the headphone jack on top,
bro have you noticed that when you update your s8 to OREO you can no longer go full screen on youtube,
Samsung should now build fingerprint scanner in front under glass Maybe in Galaxy Note 8 2017,
I think you should use Galaxy by Retrovision as one of your intro music,
If I want a good tech video I come to MKBHD,
Watching this from my just newly bought galaxy S8 ,
Gorgoeous phone im getting the s8 for christmas i had it in my hands and feels like paradise feels so good in my hands recommended phone best deal,
OMG you improve every video even though your cinematography skills are top notch Its amazing how you go over the top and shoot in the highest resolution possible just because you can To get back to the subject of the video the galaxy S8 is a truly amazing phone and you illustrate this perfectly while also addressing that the S8 isnt perfect and still has its flaws Keep up the great work creating some of the best if not the best quality videos on youtube,
Worthy to buy in 2019 bro  it has become kind of affordable in my part of the world just now ,
Dude awesome review Yeah i said awesome too I just installed one of these for someone at work and they were amazed how great it is Keep up the great work,
this is the best looking samsung so far s9 and s10 wont look good,
I have use my s8 4 months and I love design also camera,
Bought the galaxy s8 today Best smartphone Ive owned by far Would definitely recommend,
Thanks for this review Keep up the good workIt was really helpful,
201901 almost 02 and considering the S8 Thanks,
Link for the wallpaper on the MacBook in the thumbnail,
I am in love this phone Chi charging is awesome,
Am i the only person who likes the fingerprint placement When i reach for it it feels perfectly fine Probably because im right handed,
Awesome review bro convinced me to buy and I so appreciate you demonstrating the prosconsthank you,
hi marques could you review a8 2018,
The fingerprint sensor is literally the perfect position for me I have small hands but Ive always held the phone around the middle not the bottom like it seems you do so my finger doesnt have to stretch to reach the sensor Feels like a very natural position and placement to me Holding the phone any lower down makes it feel top heavy anyway So yeah fingerprint sensor is in the perfect place in my opinion,
I cant believe how far Samsung has come in 2 years from near bezelless to completely bezel less  well minus the camera cutout D ,
The future is now my laptop automatically played this video at 4K 3,
My S8 fell and immediately the screen broke Brittle phone,
Thumbs down for saying jiff,
Samsung S8 made a breakthrough infinity display I think this will set standard every new android handset Google pixel looks old now,
Hows the call quality,
I feel like alot of these issues could be solved with a custom OS,
Great review but I cringed at jif maker Its actually pronounced gif like gift,
Love your reviews you always keep real marques,
No other reviewers have put forward the review as you do I have a list of them in my subscription sectionBut I clicked only for your videoBecause I knew it will be the best,
I remember watching s8 videos almost 2 years ago in preparation to buy it Now Im about to get the s10 Nuts how time flies Also all this time I didnt know you could extend the screen shot hahaha,
Bought this last week and Im in love lol,
Galaxy S9 with Sapphire Front n Back would just mind blowingfingers crossed  No need for Cases to Hide the Real beauty of this type of Device  D,
Ive had a note3 for like 45 years and I cant have more than two apps open without it crashing so at 550 I had a mini heart attack when I saw how many apps you have open omfg haha I just ordered this phone and cant wait to use it,
Awesome job I never watch videos this long usually The S8 still is great value today,
Now Ive used this phone for two years and wow its so buggy and slow now Looking forward to receiving my S10,
2018 and this phone is still awesome Meanwhile the dissapointment that was the iPhone XS and Pixel 3 XL,
Superbowl so trash Im watching an old review,
Today ive bought the s8 and honestly the device is so sexy that i just want to put a hole in it and make love to it unprotected But Bixby is such a turn off I asked Bigsby do you have aids Bixby responded Yes I have aids thats why im here,
I bought this phone around a month ago and Im loving it,
If it was The Ultimate Smartphone it would have a removable battery,
Please my S8 just got stole so if you will be reviewing S10 kindly send me one after the review,
Cant believe this was already 5 months ago,
Aaaaand they got rid of all the useful cards theyve made Bixby worse then a month later they allowed recapping XD Rekt,
Great easter egg in the thumbnail *on that book is written Design*,
thinking about replacing my s3 with this as soon as next year starts lol,
hey man i have the galaxy s8 plus would you recommend not having a screen protector thanks,
Samsung nailed it this timeNice video,
S8 is what started the trend of bezel less tall profile phone design While Apple started the notch and no headphone jack trend,
This design might just impress Jony Ive But i have to say that apples design is not something that i would classify as bad in fact it is also good,
147 Stop leaking your phone number 9724234650,
Can anyone help me Whenever I try to increasedecrease the volume it changes the volume for the wrong thing When Im on a game or YouTube it changes the volume for incall volume or the ringtone,
Thanks for your video When that note 4 edge came out I just laughed at it So stupid IMO Same with the s6 edge Just not my thing I guess,
can you review the iblade smart case for the galaxy s8,
You can remap the Bixby Button now after a recent update The voice feature isnt brilliant but its great for the widgets and shopping,
Unbox therapy can learn a whole lot from this review,
The S8 is still the most beautiful phone Those edges and the symmetrical glass panes on both sides are just perfect,
I have a LG ZMAX Pro currently and looking to upgrade I got recommended this phone by someone on another one of Marques videos What does everyone think,
Always had an iPhone switched to an S8 recentlymy first Android I absolutely hate it Wish I had my 6S still,
Gif maker A S C E N D E D,
Man This phone is beautiful But not better than your videos lol,
Lol not so much of an ultimate smartphone,
Is s8 worthy at that price  Battery backup performance S8op5t  Pl suggest,
Watching in march 15 2019,
Can you do a S8 review  Thanks Love your reviews and video editing,
Meanwhile apple has been printing iPhones red,
today ill have it in my hands damn i cant wait thanks for your review,
I bet two years from now there will be indisplay finger print scanner and 5G,
The Best Phone 2017,
well it looks like we are moving towards screen all in all LOVELY video ,
My S8 use to turn on when I got it out of my pocket automatically but now it doesnt dont know what I did any one know love the phone tho my first flagship,
REDMI NOTE 4 IS GREAT,
Please tell which is powerfull sd 835 or exyno 8895,
Your videos always look crispy as fuck I just love watching it And great review as always ,
I find your impression about the fingerprint reader positioning very strange I just received my Galaxy S8 yesterday When I hold it in my notsobig hand in a normal way the fingerprint reader is right under the tip of my index finger Actually it would be so awkward if it was in the center and lower Some people say you may put your finger over the camera and make it dirty thats invalid too 1 Dont forget about muscle memory it will become second nature in a week 2 Cellphone lenses are already dirty in comparison to what we expect from a camera because they dont have protection and are exposed to direct touch so they should be cleaned before shooting serious photos regardless of what the phone is 3 I think cellphone cases which many people use will help us distinguishing fingerprint reader a little bit better andor protecting the lens from being touch I think the only valid complain would be from lefthanded users And finally dont forget it has iris scanner,
Thanks I got the s8 but your wallpaper looks dope Can you share its link,
Metal and Glass I am holding of right now It really doesnt feel that way And how can i get that skin,
The face unlock is prooky the most effective way for me Me and my friends tried a pic of me and it did not open lol,
Who here upgrading to the S10,
Theyve said Bixby wasnt finished I didnt think it was that unfinished,
Best smart phone as marques describedlove it,
lol I know that Tesla dealership Its on route 17 in nj,
Your damn skins  in everysingle video V,
Always see your video from years ago and forgot to subscribe my God  you great reviewer dude,
I really liked your Review The throwback to the first edgephone was nice and adds so much to The Review good Job,
You should drop a video on your music playlists,
poor fingerprint sensors are in galaxy s8,
THANKS FOR THE GOOD REVIEW  JUST GOT MY S8 TODAY  HAD I PHONE 6 FOR 3 YEARS SO HAD TO UPDATE,
I wish to buy s8 from the day it releasedI saved every penny i can to buy this phoneIs it good to buy this phone now will it be good for long term use,
damn It D brand is everywhere,
This is a beast review I am MKBHD fan,
Love your videos as always Do you think Samsung Gear S3 is worth to buy,
I gave up the iphone 7 for the s8 samsung its gorgeous,
The best channel in youtube so farMan yoy are great,
just got mine yesterday I love this phone so much but Im terrified of dropping it,
Damn Samsung and apple really upped their game 2017,
Whats the wallpaper ,
Broke my screen and had to replaced it and look back why I love my s8 plus,
Are you going to do an S8 Plus review,
Great review Would you recommend the S8 in January 2018,
his reviews video quality is beautiful,
How is this phone doing now August 2018 How about another review a year down the track,
Ive just unboxed my new S8 and this is the first video Im playing on it ,
Which is the best Android smartphone according to you,
Love the Yamaha Monitor speakers on your workstation desk,
Got the Galaxy S8 and this was the first vid I loaded up on it to test the screen quality So good Both the video and the screen  ,
What if i say i prefer s8 fingerprint scanner more than s9  Because if i put my finger straight it fits right in,
Ill get this one day,
That Bixsby stuff has turned me off I hate bloat ware,
Using this beauty since 2017 to date Still very much powerful and high end Zero regrets getting it on a 2 year contract Even better value now than going with all the Oppos and Vivos coming out Not hating on those brands though cause they make great phones as well just not on the same level as tier 1 brands such as Samsung,
thanks for the great review,
I liked this up until you said Jif instead of Gif Down voted and unsubbed,
To be honest I think Im going to wait on the S9 because Im satisfied with my s7 edge I always wait for a double update but to be more honest the reason I do it is because I cant afford to update every year,
Is android pie version available in this s8,
Marques your review is perfect however there is one big problem That third right black rhomboid in the background is not aligned with the other two cmon man,
Samsung has the most modern design Ive ever seen,
Your wall art is not aligned correctly Unsubed,
I feel like watching Stephen A Smith debate for some reason now,
Hey what is that background called Been Looking for it,
You must have a Tesla,
Watching in the first 20 minutes of having my s8,
Beautiful and Amazing always CRISPY videos MKBHDI will always appreciate your skills in cinematography,
Please tell me how you get this awesome S8 wallpaper,
wowdifference between his videos and other videos are truely day and night super crisp and brightthat RED camera is truely awsumi wonder how rich is he,
Hug mud ceremony out male innovation deer walk hallway airport,
Marquess please make a video having comparison between Sony Xperia XZ1 and Samsung Galaxy S8 NOT s8 plus,
got my s8 yesterday Its beautiful,
I need that wallpaper on my s8 Can anyone tell which wallpaper is he using,
the back button is on the left this time im triggerd lol not really i love samsung,
I need a phone to film YouTube videos and goof off I think I found that phone ,
S8 Vs Pixel 2 XL comparison,
Whens the Lg g6 Review Marquess I bought my g6 and I really want your review YOU ARE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER YOU ARE AWESOME,
Watching on my S8,
Amazing phone but i have a giant piece of dirt right under the middle of the screen charger port is bipolar and the back cracked from a 2ft drop,
Bro you live in Kearny I live 1 town over,
Great review as always But a more in depth review of the camera capabilities would be much appreciated,
Your video is always the best One of my favourite tech youtuber,
One year laterI still love my S8 Plus and I wont switch to s9 Plus,
Still not convinced to switch from S5 to S8,
Love my S8,
Xperia xz premium is the most complete phone in the world,
Not only does he get phones early he gets skins too I preordered two skins from two different manufacturers a month ago and they havent even shipped them yet I get my S8 tomorrow and dont have protection,
Marques Brownlee do the debrand skins disable the wireless charging on the S8 Plus,
Whats ur opinion for S8 in 2019 if u get for 350 ,
Your Bluetooth video is based on unbacked facts go and watch Android Authoritys video explaining why,
Is it worth the upgrade from my s5,
Im probably in the minority but I would love to see an s8 edge mini that I can comfortably use with one hand and yes I know theres a one hand mode,
Linus or Marques ,
I LITERALLY GOT A 2 HOUR AD ON THIS VIDEO WTF,
Watching on Galaxy S8 Cool,
Hi Marques Just bought an S8 and was wondering if you use a screen protector and if so what brand,
Samsung lovers here,
I saw you on tv Nice,
Idk what it is Sometimes the screen doesnt respond to my touch But great video keep doing your thing And a great phone,
iPhone 7 Plus 100 Still 100 Overnight Standby You Cant Touch That,
Will switch to this from the iPhone 7 ,
watching this video on an iphone 3gsgod bless me ,
if your going to put a decent camera on a phone have a lens cover doesnt matter how good the camera is if the lens is all scratched up the photos are not going to be quality,
What is the name of that colourful bluetooth speaker should in the background at 408,
really beautiful phone,
I like hearing you have big hands,
Damn 1025 This shot looked like Samsungs own ad,
how is your voice so crisp does your camera have a microphone,
228 standby overnight should be a red flag for any potential buyer That just sounds defective,
Great Phone revieuw but what you could do better is on the end of every phone revieuw give it a rating example S8 10 out of 10 stars Or Iphone 7 plus 10 out 10 stars,
nice view from your flat anyway will there be a S8 mini version,
Wallpaper please,
I just watched your review on the Galaxy S3 review and wow we have came a long way into technology,
Ive got this phone had it about 6 months Still not sure its a great phone but working with it,
Two words Expandable memory,
Im getting the s8 I cant wait It looks like the Phone is so tiny because of his hands,
Watching this on my new galaxy I got today c,
man my iphone 5 and eve 1st gen itouch has better standby time,
Love the design but w the curved edges you get reflected light obscuring your view of the screen along those edges,
I think an Iris scanner is the most underrated feature of any phone ever,
Damn this phone is sexy Apple better step up their game,
just subbed love your review,
The fact dey patched da button makes me wanna conjure Nikola Tesla for da phone industry Imagine humans payin 1000 for a phone from scratch We chose our own stock apps  specs Dats da only way Im payin a rack 4a phone,
it might be less secure but the number pin still works,
For me sony xz premium and Moto z are the best designe phones,
i dont use spekers i use HEDE PHONES,
Love this phone especially after using an Htc 728g for the last 2 years,
When youre waiting for your s8 plus to arrive,
phones have become so good these days that Marques literally has to nit pick every new phone that comes out cos there just isnt anything else to complain about Like when he complains about him not being able to reach the top of the screen or the finger print scanner,
copycat company just making hw beautiful,
Good lord I have a S8 but dude needs to get laidwyf,
Im moving to Samsung Galaxy S8,
I want to win the s8,
Casey is not even a pro reviewer and he has 34M reviews on his S8 video MKBHD love the way you present phonesyou could make a guy wanna buy the Nokia 3310 by your cinematography,
Can u say which was the intro song plzzzz plzz,
Who else is is whatching this from an older galaxy ehem galaxy 4,
i have normal sized hands and its pretty effortless to me to reach the button of my s8,
OnePlus 5T or S8,
Where is the limited edition super hero galaxy S8 ,
Samsung should build a flat screen variant with a removable battery and keep the water resistance Then Ill b happy,
Its Gif not Jif,
This phone plus Nova Launcher prime  best phone ever,
Speaker is not good but come with akg earbuds thats fair enough,
Dude whats your pc screensaver 11 mins in Octopus Rainbow,
You pronounce it Jeef Im a little sad right now PS I know the inventor of the GIF also pronounces it that way but thats not how languages work making it irrelevant,
Witch do u like more s8 or s8,
The pacesetter has done it again We are almost in 2019 and just look around and see every brands designing their phones after thisbut that finger print sensors position was damn wrong,
Samsung no longer needs to copy Apple Theyve broken free and are innovating Im very pleased with that,
Should i get the s9 instead Im asking for people who have both,
Hey Marques how and with what mic do you record your voice I noticed the UA audio interface ,
Hey welcome from s9 video,
Some people trying not to be butthurt about the fignerprint sensor LOL ,
The fingerprint scanner is in the absolute right spot for me because I wouldnt use it anyways At least it looks symmetric ,
Does s8 really need a screen protectoras it is difficult to Find perfect protector for that curved screen,
A  Another P,
Does S8 and S9 differ from the S8 Plus and S9 Plus,
Whats the wallpaper from the Galaxy s8 please send me the link from it I love it,
Hi Bro This day if you compare S8 with One Plus 6  which one is best to buy I need better camera,
Do you lose a lot of the curved edge screen with a skin or cover,
Bro u got such big hand,
Wallpaper link,
the S8 has already won Ive heard heaps of people at my school saying theyre switching to Android yet I heard nobody talking about switching from Android to iPhone when the 7 came out,
Do a comparison of the galaxy s8 vs the google pixel 2,
When I left my S8 Plus off the charger around 75 I woke up and checked it and it was at 75,
I just got done watching his video on the s3 how far things have came since 2012,
And dont forget it does also have a puls sensor You can measure oxygenheartbeat etc,
the way you explain everything so meticulously first ritual to do in the morning search YouTube for new mkbhd video,
Youre cute and great review I hate review videos usually,
It is the most sold model of Samsung,
Just got my s8 and tbh the fingerprint sensor position is fine it just feels a little slower than my old 6p But after spending 5 mins disabling Bixby and remapping the button yes you can still do it to the Assistant its damn near perfect My only real complaint is that its easy to accidentally touch things since the screen is so close to the edges,
*Background music needed,
Guess its about time to get the S7,
I went from s2 to s5 to s8 Great phone,
What if mkbhd had a storage for all the phones he bought,
Please do a comparison video on OnePlus 5 vs Samsung galaxy s8please please please,
Love this phone but also loved my s6 edgeWhats bixby all about,
This will be his most viewed video Im calling it right now,
Do I get this phone the Pixel 2 or wait for the S9,
my s8 dropped down a flight of stairs and my entire life flashed infront of my eyes s8 survived w no cracks or scratches bless,
189 ratio,
great review Im getting this phone thx,
You can drop an S7 in a pool but dont drop it next to a pool,
2019 Like if you are in 2019,
watching this on an s7 in 2019,
I have iphone 4s Time for an upgrade Im looking at this phone,
everytime you type a name of a popular phone mkbhd first,
I dont care about speakers I use headphones like 95 of the time,
Like who is watching on s7,
Still good after 2 years Why do people always need the latest and greatest,
watched this before i bought the s7 watching it now on my s7 3,
Seeing this video one last time before putting my s7 edge to rest upgrading to S10 plus so hyped,
I miss removing the battery,
Wonder why this was recommended to me in 2019,
Why recommend this in 2019,
Im behind the curve I have an S3 and just ordered an S7 Always a few years behind but Im cheap Great review,
YouTube recommended this for me in 2019  Why  Why   But Im watching anyway,
funny how Im watching this on the galaxy s7,
so is dbrand sponsoring every single tech youtuber or something,
I would rather have the S7 over the S8 or the S8 plus I cant get over the aspect ratio of the S8 As in I like how the S7 is and did not think they should have changed it Anywaythe S7 is an awesome phone Yes hate me if you want but Im using the iPhone 6s Plus but thinking of the S7 as my next phone I enjoy both operating systems Android and iOS Switch it up between the two,
Watching the review of a phone Ill never get,
this is the only guy I watch for reviews lol,
I finally can afford one  F yeah,
Watching an s7 video in 2019 Lol,
i got a s4 and i have to keep it for another year lol,
Id rather have waterproofing than upgraded speakers,
GPU Adreno 430  I think its 530,
Im getting this phone tomorrow Yay,
dropped my s7 from a fast moving automobile the screen did not scratch had mine on contract that did not include self damage the phone edge did scratch though but screen and back are scratch free,

2019 and the battery has gone from bad to worse,
I plan on getting one this Black Friday I wish Walmart had the S7 Edge version but it seems like itll be a nice upgrade from my S5,
I LOVE this reviewer,
The snapdragon 820 doesnt have an adreno 430 gpu It has a 530,

But in my country you no s7 with snapdragon You have samsung exynos Is that betterworser than the snapdragon,
Is it the best 5 premium Android yet allrounder,
Thank you very much for this review best review,
Just came across your videos for the first time as Im in the market for a new phone Ive gotta say these are some of the smoothest easiest to interpret and highest quality reviews Ive seen on the web Thanks so much for your help and keep up the good work,
watching on my s9 plus,
I Love you man Im what watching yours videos forever,
Its adreno 530 not 430 and ur bag is made in the Philippines,
Samsungs killing it this year with their amazing phones,
oddly enuff so many phone review vids never actually talk about the phone quality lol,
Watching the review after 1 year ,
just got a S7 S5 was a trooper pretty much only my carrier texts me when they charge me at the end of the month but its all good,
No pun intended That was totally intended Best moment D,
No IR blaster TF Samsung how am I going to turn all of the TVs on in my school and public places,
Mines on its way coming from a iPhone 5,
Good articulate review,
It feels like this was such a long time ago,
I always watch you reviews thank you brother,
Best to buy in 2018 budget,
Just preordered mine and I got the 200 gb media card,
Im still rockin my sexy S7 but boy the S10 is awfully tempting  gonna prolly snatch one up on black Friday this year,
230 wallpaper,
This was a great and intelligible review You are very articulate Thank you,
This just makes me more satisfied with picking the 6P,
what s your opinion on purchasing an S7 edge in 2017,
You are amazing That was a perfect review,
My S7 AMOLED screen saves me a good amount of battery especially if I watch your videos,
I would give up the waterproofing for IMPROVED SPEAKERS That is a killer for me because I love great dual front stereo speakers I have to pass on this phone,
First time getting a flagship Here I go S7,
May 2017 Here wondering if i can afford it now,
galaxy s7 is worth the upgrade for me because is much much much faster camera focus is goddanm fast and i love always on display,
107 Made In Philippines,
How does the Snapdragon 820 compare to the Exynos 8890,
Great review thanks a lot What do you think about amoled burn inghosting issues,
Is the speaker really not so good I use it alot music programs music and videos Should i look for something else maby I love my galaxy s5 but its coming towards the end of its life spann,
Im so happy c I got mine yesterday,
hey Marques  at min 240 where you were talking about the S7s specs  im afraid snapdragon 820 has adreno 530 gpu not 430  the older SD810 has the Adreno 430 gpu ,
That shirt has gotten so worn out over the years  Get a new shirt dude,
No IR blaster No removable batteryback 43 camera sensor I think Ill pass,
Very clear and concise review Thank you for the clarity and great enunciation,
Thanks for the review It was very helpful,
I had my dads used S4 Hell its worth the upgradenice phone,
I miss this intro,
hello sir  i need to know that which smartphone is best  iPhone 6s plus or samsang s7,
Always great content I just ordered an S7 today from an S5 Definitely an upgrade Thanks,
Finally getting this upgrading from S5 neo,
Galaxy S7 ELECTROCUTED ME I bought my device in April 2016 and it had already gone for repair twice to the service centre This is the 3rd time I have faced an issue with the charging port on the phone as it ELECTROCUTED me I am not even exaggerating it literally shocked me while it was in my right front pocket The intensity was so high that I jumped and screamed in pain After multiple requests Samsung has shamelessly denied to replace my device I had just returned from work on my motorcycle 5 mins before the incident I COULD HAVE DIED if this would have happened while I was riding on the highway and no one would have known why I crashed I had a lot of trust in Samsung but how their service team has behaved with me is beyond shameful The service manager on the phone even told me that compensation would have been provided if something bad had happened I was baffled by such a remark because it shows how much they care about their consumers Samsung Note 7 the grenade wasnt enough that they created Galaxy S7 the tazer Dont be a fool like me DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG devices if you want to be safe Regards Kushal Kaushik This is a genuine case write to me is you have any suggentions on how I should deal with Samsung  SocialJunkiee,
The s7 is kinda small for me I wish it was like an inch bigger than the s6,
I seriously dont understand how theres gorgeous phones like this on the market yet people still go to Apple whats special about apple,
great detailed video youre very handsome,
Sir you are my gadget reference at all the time,
Looking at that old Instagram layout in 2018 is so weird Crazy to see how it is now versus 2 years ago I dont even remember it like that,
came out last year might grab as an upgrade over my xperia z5,
i have an iphone 5 should i change to the S7 im totally pulling your leg here of course i am going to change to this beauty,
Would be perfect if they reduce the resolution to 1080p,
This is the best reviews Ive ever watched I like the logo by the way,
Watch the video while read the comments,
hey marques  i bought it 3 days ago and i am facing a heating issue while charging fast charging its temperature nearly 40 deg and while on facebook its temp is 3738 deg is this normal or it had any issue FYI  the room temp in my house is 30 deg It would be helpful if you replied,
God damn I want this but S8 is right around the corner,
Wait so the micro usb port and headphone jack are rated water resistant too I dont want to lose an S7 the same way I lost my S4 Coffee in the charging port ,
good job the only think you missing is the remote control thats disappointed me,
T H I C C,
Currently using carrier pigeons at the moment would this phone be a good upgrade,
So I can watch pornhub while watching hentai This is proof god is real,
well i dunno nexus 6p or samsung s7 which is betterfaster at browsing web less laggywith better camera and better slow motion,
this phone looking good on nougat,
watching on my s7 sweet phone from an iPhone 6s,
Watching this on my s8 lmao,
WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS ALL DAY LONG IS MY KIND OF YOUTUBING,
Very well explained and you are cute too,

The good old days were we didnt care about bezzels oo man i really wanna go back,
This review is very helpful Thanks,
I got mine for Christmas with the goggles I love this phone ,
how does a 3000mah battery gets over 5 hours on screen display ,
i have s6 waiting for s8 i cant go around changing my phone once a year,
Iphone 6s or galaxy s7 This is my biggest descision,
very impressed with your review you have talent,
I still have my galaxy s7 and it still works perfectly for me,
Please do make a video on Galaxy S7 after it gets Android 80 Oreo update highlighting the improvements specifically about the camera part and also the cons of the update Please do consider making it as it will going to help all the fellow Galaxy S7 users like us to know whether the update is worth it or not Hope youll consider my request,
At least now the Apple fanboys got something to be jealous of D,
it has the adreno 530 gpu not the 430,
Youre so buff,
Im deciding if I should get this phone now since I looked up at the price and they became cheaper But should I get it,
I have a 4s but just upgraded to this so Vodafone send me a link to your videos so Id know more about the phoneThanks for the information ,
MKBHD THE BEST,
seems that the s6 has better sound quality with better DAC and the exynoss is better,
55 hours SOT I got like 35 at first then it got to 2 and flipped and bought a Moto g5 plus,
s7 have adreno 530 not adreno 430 MKBHD,
um its adreno 530 not 430,
My husband is still using his S7 Great phone,
Thanks for the vid,
Ive got mine fifteen days ago I really love it,
Made in the Phillipines,
what kind of theme do you use,
Great review dude Im slowly thinking about getting the S7 over iPhone 7,
Im used to using HTC so if rather have good Speakers its not like I live in the ocean,
That 820 is still super quick I was impressed,
Good concise but pretty full review,
220 idk but i liked how mkb said i did not expect that to actually happen please remix this,
Its wierd seeing a galaxy s7 edge without cracks in the screen,
Got a s2 for like 5 years now I cant say goodbye to it it works brilliant,
Would it be smart to upgrade from my 6s to the S7 for more storage and being in budget,
he meant to say adreno 530 lol,
Now it looks and feels like Im using a smaller Note7 except the Spen and eye scanner Thanks to Android7 Nougat update I like the Video Enhancer very much,
front facing speakers God darn it Xperia z5 premium is the best phone I have ever had guys go for it,
Love this intro beatHate when it changesLove my s7,
t mobile just cut the price of this phone to 360 or 15 a month,
Galaxy S7 is great value for money in 2018 better than new budget devices,
just got mine the width and weight is a bit change from my note 4 still love it,
My Mom just got one of these Im jealous,
Dont buy it they have made it thinner making the front glass very thin and it breaks easy Had it in my front pocket and now has hairline crack in the screen,
Galaxys are the best sp,
This or the HTC 10 I had an S5 and I hated touchwiz but Ive heard its improved massively,
just got the s7 edge blue coral and I love it,
52018 just given this pile of shit bc the battery started dying 18 months into use Nice,
lol how do you get 5 hours soti get 3 hrs sot watching YouTube lol,
does anyone knnow how much it would cost to fix an s7 edge screen,
i have a oneplus one would it be worth upgrading to this,
Just got this phone It is amazing,
Power button is a little low for my taste,
Did anyone else notice that the Galaxy S7 has the adreno 530 not 430 like he said,
where is his background from,
Does it have OIS,
watching this on galaxy s7 under 1440p wow,
Wow thats you only 3 years ago,
its the adreno 530 not the 430,
any success on monthly security updates,
What is the name of the intro song to this video,
andriod or simple volume high low,
S7 in 2019 and still happy,
The battery is a champion,
Galaxy S7 or OnePlus 3t And why Not sure about what to buy,
Thinking about upgrading from the G1 Is it worth it,
Many people have complained about their S7 heating up Are you facing this issue aswell,
Question how much storage does the device have left out of the box right after you start it for the first time Some websites say 8GB is used and others say 16GB Thats a huge difference,
Its Adreno 530 yeah,
the wallpaper,
Im an iPhone user but Samsung has definitely stepped up their game compared to last years S6 Good job on the review Marques ,
did you replace the TouchWiz launcher,
HAHA I love the Tshirt Y,
Ive the potential to get this phone really cheap or just go with Oneplus 3T which one should I get guys Im almost thinking about the Oneplus 3T really even if I were able to get one of these for the same price The S7 have pretty bad audio quality right,
Should I buy this now in Jan 2017 or wait for the s8 release which is on Apr But I dont buy phones at the initial release and wait for prices to go down a bit So that means I actually have to wait til JunJul Lol Coming from an a5 2015 phone,
So the big question is is the S7 worth it Austin comes and takes his Licensing money,
I have a snap dragon 200 will the 820 be faster,
Anyone having problems with the Nougat update  Phone freezes or reboots randomly,
I have a question Should I upgrade from my iPhone 6 Plus,
its Adreno 530,
That Always Still On feature is dope as hell,
Watching this on my S7,
does the s7 block screen to turn from apps when i get a notification from them beside sms and phone when phone is locked,
Awesome bro I lov ur reviews,
240 Galaxy S7 uses a Adreno 530 not 430 Adreno 430 was part of the snapdragon 810 soc,
once you go samoled you can never go back,
Bought this phone about week ago Its insane fast,

Its sad that people dont understand theyre buying small laptops with shitty specs in the price of a monster pc I mean oneplus 3 literally just came out and its already kind of half the price of an iphone 6 when iphone 7 is coming out soon Good job oneplus for keeping it real and selling their products in a decent price,
This phone have more RAM than most peoples computers  ,
Here we were debating about the 1080p screen in 2016 while Apple just ripped off a 828p iPhone Xr in 2018 for fckin 750 ,
Still rocking my OnePlus 3 still smooth still lasts a day still amazing Best buy ever waiting for OP6T release today,
That phone has more RAM than my computer,

This with Android O still kills it Everythings butter smooth With the Gcam now not sure when to upgrade my phone anymore,
One Plus 3 was the most beautiful phone by One Plus,
In my opinion this guy is still the best reviewer on the web Informative professional thorough doesnt get bogged down with too many technicalities He seems to nail it every time Really liking the look of this phone great specs combined with a very competitive price whats not to like,
103 I thought you almost dropped it,

Hi Marques This is Rishikesh I do follow your videos since 3 to 4 years and I have a question for you please do reply me I have purchased OnePlus 3 on Oct 27 and 3T was announced on Nov 15 I guess So did I miss anything major by going with 3 or is it good deal rather,

Thanks for the real clean video bro This made me subscribe,
Your phone reviews are impeccable I guess thats why your channel is so big now Congrats on all the success,
You should consider making a video about how far one plus has come since op3,
Watching it on the day of OnePlus 6 launch,
Yes great review  but you didnt mention the low price point  How can this really be compared to other phones that costs double,
oneplus didnt take any gambles with the design then shows poker chips DD,
Someone stole my one plus 3 while I was in a market and Im indian,
This video made me switch from iOS to android and its the best decision I made thank you Marques Keep it up Marques,
122 Oneplus didnt take any huge gamble with the outside of this phone **takes a shot with phone on poker desk and with coins next to phone** Good job Marques good job,

watching in my OnePlus 3 3,
Ground Breaking lol I actually like that cover Looks good,
can u do a comparison between Sony xperia XA ultra and oneplus 3,
have the HTC One M8 is an upgrade to the OnePlus 3 worth to upgrade,
When you get technical the dash charge system is the best from a battery care stand point Many LiPos can be charged at 2C which is double the capacity of the battery and results in a 30min charge time They love high current but hate high voltage which is what the other comps have been using,
This is the current hot buy on stuffs gadget magazine book,
Will the One Plus 3 work on Sprints network,
I dont understand when people buy 900 phones when this thing is 330,
ks Jakub Bartczak intro d,
This was a very informative and helpful video but I have never heard anybody call Disc Golf frolf wtf is up with that,
your skin tone always adds a great contrast holding the phones,
Guys The OnePlus 3 or the IPhone SE,
One plus three is four minus one thats three QUICK MATHS,
HES A YE FAN I KNEW I COULD TRUST HIM MARQUEZ FOR PRESIDENT,
worth switching from Nexus 6P,
Should I buy HTC 10 or this I wonder about the quality of this p,

Good review man from China ,
Something is wrong with my One plus 3 Mic After plugging earphones my voice gets extremely low on calls Other party can barely hear me and When i plug out the earphones its fine i ve been trying to find a solution to fix it  anyone got any idea,

Love what you do Love your review videos totally very humorous Love the editing and the cameras that you use your studio looks superb All the best buddy,

Definitely Buying it There are some downside according to my usage but they get aside when put light on the areas where it easily keep upGood work One plusand MKBHD your videos help us a lot to buy stuff,
when i bought s7 i was happy that apple cannot fool me at least and then one plus 3 came,
I think this might be my go toafter my exploding note7,
wish my s7 had a 1080p screen battery life is awful,
Who else came from Twitter ,
Can I use this on cricket,
watching this vid on a oneplus 3 its great,
hows the battery life after the update Im looking to buy the phone and battery is huge for me dont really care for dash charging whats SOT like with your usage lmk please,
Please review Huawei Honor 8 I need to know your thoughts about it ,
BRUH this just came out how LOL,
How themes are changed in OP3,
When your smartphone has more RAM than your gaming PC,
Damn this is one amazing review,
Im at my OnePlus X and this is gonna be my next upgrade D thanks Marques your videos are always a source for important data for me at the time of evaluating options,
He keeps saying its kinda boring 1045 he says theyre not trying to do anything groundbreaking just crushing the spec game Isnt that *exactly* what Apple do Except they dont even bother crushing the spec game They just show up with something,
One plus 3 moto x force  moto z play whose camera is better,
You have the best intro,
oneplus 3 still have the call drop or it is now fine after the update anyone,
thanks for the review Ohi miss Hoboken,
helloNow I am using this phone and I am come from China,

OnePlus 2  3 Illuminati confirmed,

i do like a lot of your video i would like to see lenovo foldable phone sony xepria xa ultra or premium some chinese model phone i have a question how can you afford so many phones,
actually i believe the camera hump just saved my phone from a spill,
i guess i found the right phone for me Thanks Marques,
link to the wallpaper,
Hey Would you do a comparison between one plus three and s7 edge,
No Matter how I think about this but When I heard 6GB RAM my mind stopped working,
Seriously though who is saying Yeah my current phone is alright but I wish it would be thinner at the expense of battery life Leave being tethered to a power adapter to iPhones,
You forgot the OnePlus X 023,
OnePlus 3T in 4 days Review,
Great review Hows the GPS,
I hear the new software update has done away with throttling the Ram Has it ,
Mr Brownlee I have to tell you how clean and informative your review was It hit all the right points You were not selling the phone you were reviewing it You did a great job You enabled any interested party to take what you said and compare it to whatever they were considering You gave enough information to cause an interested party to do further investigation and maybe make a purchase I appreciated your review thanks,
Just got mine today ,
Im still rocking my OnePlusOne that low battery life is concerning Thanks for review,
Didnt take away headphone jack iPhone7,
no huge gambles I C WUT YOU DID THUR,
One plus is really good device in budget range,
Seems you cant use a regular charger and be okay with slow charging without possibly damaging your phone I took some time out sadly after ordering the phone to ask the question below I think this is big deal killer for me as I tend to have a charger at home work and car in order to avoid carrying a charger  cable Doesnt help that they charge an absurd fee for their charger and cable Q What happens if I charge with a regular cable and wall charger Will it damage the phone A Yes it is possible that it can damage the device The response was from Sam OnePlus Support,
Where can I buy it phisically In san diego Please,
134 and this is the fourth OnePlus phone INCEPTIONS,
is this phone worth it to but this year 2018,
mkbhd,
One more thing too many buttons for android phone one thing I appreciate zuk z2pro is their utouch just 1 single button and can do all functions you required  and can customize,
Still using this phone Sept 2018,
That home button tactile or touch sensitive I assume the latter Also great to see the LED notification is still there ,
I definitely know what phone Ill be getting next,
I love your reviews your my go to for all the reviews I need thanks,
1013 where did you get that skin from Im from India I too need it please,
y no sd 1 y u do dis,
Remember when OnePlus said people dont use NFC much Well,
Some say the performance is actually better optimized here than on Nexi which sounds weird to me since Google should handle the original version of the software better than everyone else as for Apple and the iPhone Although Ill still wait for the new Pixel phones to be unveiled I think Ill still pick the OnePlus 3 specially for its low price,
Budget beast Flagship killer,
That was a solid review Thanks man,
watching one plus 3 review on a one plus 3,
4000mah battery could make that the best flagship on the market period but they forgot their roots,
still good the design looks greatt htc one m8 one plus 3,
Hey Marques question for you coming from a Nexus 5 what do you reckon I should go for Oneplus 3 or a 6P,
Amazing 500 Australian dollars for this,
The OnePlus 3 is their 4th phone remember the OnePlus X,
I think I am going to upgrade from my iPhone 5s to this,
i want to buy it but I am confused that which is the best one plus 3 or moto x force,
url for the wallpaper Marques used on one plus 3,
Thats true I agree with that ,
Is one plus 3T worth buying or should i purchase one plus 3,
The design looks like they took ideas from the iPhone 6 Plus nexus 65x and the Samsung galaxy s67,
what should i go for Xiaomi mI5 pro or one plus 3,
do you have a link to this wallpaper please,
Hi lot of users are facing battery drain issues after the latest anroid update can you help by giving a solution to it ,
thanks for the video dude Helped me to make the decision on buying the phone,
make a comparison between oneplus 3 and zte axon 7 ,
You dont reply to your subscribers Great going bro,
When OnePlus was used to be known to create great phones in a small price before they went up to 480 with the OnePlus 5 Plus that thinner bezel tho,
i imagine you get a lot of these phones sent to you for free to review so why would they not even watch and listen to your reviews you praise them for the extra battery in the old phone and say other companies should do it then with this phone they are just like F U,
can you please do a review of the LG stylo Im deciding what to upgrade to,
oh yes samsung flicker displays are wonderful _,
Bought a oneplus 3 last week and now im watching all these reviews about the op3 and some say that the screen is unsharp and colour inaccurate Is this really the case,
It doesnt have an OLED display it has an OpticAmoled display,
What OIS are you talking about,
Oneplus 3 worth extra price over oneplus 2,
This may be the only phone that will take my Blackberry Priv away from me,
Im using my one plus 3 After two years its still fantastic and fast,
This phone is awesome I will never go back to Samsung again or god forbid Apple,
Yo Marques salute my brother,
Im watching this video on the OnePlus 3,
Awesome video again man Thank you,
ive had mine for about a year and i gotta say just as fast as when i got it its a great phone,
One plus 3 VS Nexus 6P,
One  3 or Axon 7,
Nexus 6p or OnePlus 3 what phone should i choose Does the price difference worth buying the OnePlus 3,
oneplus 3 is better than asus znefone 3 ,
i just love the intro,
Should this phone work with metro pcs,
First phone Im genuinely investing money into excited to get it in the mail,
Moving from Nexus 5 to this phone after Google released the Pixel at a ridiculous price 1 did a great job on this phone,
Fantastic review u made my choice,
I currently have a Note 4 Would the oneplus3 be an upgrade or basically a lateral move,
The fingerprint scanner is faster than touch ID due to the fact that you dont need to press a button to activate it and theres a quicker animation,
OnePlus 3 and its accessories are a rarity in my country Whenever I look for a screen protector I go from stall to stall and ask do you have a screen protector then the saleslady will ask for what phone sir then Ill ask OnePlus 3 Then the lady would look at me with a crunched up forehead like Im asking her a math problem,
One plus 4 should be waterproof i think,
tap finger resolve convey investigation,
I love that phone classic,
258 imma need a link to that wallpaper pls,
the question i have how fragile this smartphone is my sony xperia fell so damn often on the ground and never had a broken screen or something,
Flagship phone really beast dont know what to expect in future phones,
does it have 25D curved glass on top,
I have the OnePlus 1 and couldnt use android pay he mentioned in the video that this one has nfc does that mean you can use android pay,
1 plus 3 is equal to 4,
So Google is better,
Who is the president of the Me watching in 2017 sighs*,
I asked Google Assistant allo Whos better Siri or You She said Thats a Sirious question ,
Google Assistant will kill Siri in the years coming,
iPhone Who is Mark sucker burg,
the whole video was like asking two of the smartest kids in class questions,
Google assistant is the best go android,
Who is the president of the United States  Umbetter not talk about it ,
No doubt Google Assistant is far better than Siri,
How tall is united states,
when Siri doesnt understand the question she just asks google smart lol,
Nice video  I like google assistant more,
they need to make a name for the google assistantwho thinks so,
and Google Assistant has games and also sings YOU NEED TO TRY IT,
So siri is like dory,
Siri definitely needs to be more intelligent No joke Yesterday I asked Siri how to make fried chicken Her reply The main ingredient in fried chicken is chicken,
GOOGLE IS THE BEST GOOGLE IS SMART,
iam from nepal,
Google is boss,
Mark Suckerburg ROFL LMAO,
I asked Are you better than Siri Google Assistant said Thats a Sirious question,
make me a sandwich Youre a sandwich 1010 would ask again,
when he said make me a sandwich google u r a sandwich google is not funny its savage,
Thanks Buddy for asking the capital of Nepal,
Google Assistant brought me here,
siri does not know the president thats sad,
So its pretty clear to that google assistant is better,
OUT OF BOTH OF THEM I CHOOSE CORTANA,
I died at Mark Sucker Burg Rip me,
Google assistant is best in information Bixby is best in controlling the phone with voice but both qualities are lacking in siri,
Make me a sandwich Poof youre a sandwich Wow,
Who else is watching in 2017 and expected Donald Trump to come up for president,
google has more sexy voice,
this is why I use Android,
Did you guys know that google assistant can sing and pretend and can do more Team google forever,
Make me a sandwich Google *Poof* Google Youre a sandwich *Im dead* xD,
That math question i just love how they both answered at the exact same time,
Google Assistant is Bapp of all,
I am from Nepal and you made me happy,
I asked the assistant WHO IS BETTER YOU OR SIRI  assistants replyI THINK SIRI IS GREAT BUT I AM MORE GOOGLEY assistant is so humble Love it,
How fun would it be to let them talk to eachother,
*WINK* youre a sandwich,
lots of android phone companies vs just the iPhone Not a fair fight,
I think google is more friendly but cant take a selfie when we are far from itthat really Siri doesand ofcourse reading emails by Siri is spectacular,
Siri just roast itlike you did to ms ,
1037 *This is astonishing* Google assistant adjusts the pitch of each syllable to convey excitement and even breaths in before saying stay calm Give it 4 years call centers are about to become redundant,
Google Assistant,
Hey MKBHDThanks for mentioning Nepal in the video I mean it was like a random topic and you asked bout nepalThats really awesomeYou gained my Sub,
so if the pixel is from Google and when Siri doesnt know it just asks its competitor,
10min Doubletime lol D,
I asked Google who is siri it said siri is a very nice girl from silicon Valley,
Google assistant rules,
Who else are watching although they own a Google pixel,
Do Bixby vs Google Assistant,
THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL,
I have use both Google assistant is best,
Thanks for mentioning Nepal Love from Nepal,
Who is Zach Sucker burg Wow siri *claps hands together sloowwly*,
google assistant wins When siri doesnt know how to answer something she simply google it and display it lol,
Me make me a sandwitch Google assistant *poof* your a sandwith now,
Yo Bro You Asked What is the capital of Nepal and U got my likes instantly ,
we nepalis wsrs sleeping when you were making these video LoveFromNepal,
I cracked when heard Google say *poof* youre a sandwich,
Hi what phone Models have Google Assistant 18th August 2017Thank you,
my experience with Google Assistant ok Google call name redacted here is what I found on the web for call name redacted,
Im watching on my PC and I feel like a kid stuck in a parents fight,
ask goodle assistant are u better than siri,
To be honest Im an IPhone user however Google impressed me with that Google Assistant With such quality and attitude to the customers I think Im definitely planning to rethink my views regarding Android Software,
Omg the last part xD,
Hey great video Youre really making great content and Im looking forward to even more great content from you ,
Thanks for including Nepal in your video,
Yap  Kathmandu is Capital Of Nepal   Proud You Know about Nepal  I am from That Country ,
Wait wait wait why is siri using bing bing  microsoft wait wat,
Google assistant is the best,
Wow Nepal Thanks Bro for mentioning Nepal,
Google assistant better than siri  Google assistants voice better than Siri,
*poof* Youre a sandwich Oh My Go,
whos the president of united States  that crazy guy  Donald Trump,
Luckily Google Assistant on the Pixel beats everything And now when it comes to more android devices its really good Hope Bixby will be as good as G Assistant,
The intro song is Ongoing Thing by 20syl Like so others can see,
Prsident of United States Siri searching on website,
Fun fact If you ask Google Assistant who her first crush is she says Siri,
Capital of nepal is Kathmandu and I am nepali,
I prefer the Google assistant and thanks for this comparison video,
Capital of Nepal  Great touch dude,
Finest comparison video Ive seen Video editing is dope and intro music is so dope please keep it And when you asked a complex math question to AI assistants i was impressed i would have never though like that Btw height of united states was funny Great video Keep it up brother ,
both voices sounds similar do they use the same voice actor,
omg did u say Nepal  in abroad nobody does know about Nepal M from Nepal  Tq so much for the such big prides for Our Country lol,
LMFAO How tall is the United States xD Nice one Siri,
oh my god siri is jason Krueger dun dun duuuuuun XD,
Marques  Make me a sandwich google pixe *sound effect* Youre a sandwich,
How tall is the United States Oh Siri you never fail to make me laugh,
Im from Nepal MKBHD your the best,
Captions Hey whats up guys Im PhD here XD,
I asked her what her fav holiday is then she said april 1st no foolin  I laughed so hard,
How about Make me a sandwich Ive ordered your usual sandwich from Panera Bread it will be delivered in 30 minutes and charged to your Discover Card Confirm,
Well Im from Nepal Ya definitely the right answer,
youre a lucky man i tried but she said a mark suck a bird,
The make me a sandwich part made me laugh so much mainly his reaction,
I lost it when Siri responded with How tall is United States,
Hey Marques could you do a real indepth 2017 iOS vs stock Android comparison Or just a iPhone 7 v Google Pixel showdown I think people would love that and love to hear your opinion on the subject I know I certainly will Thanks,
Both do basic task But I rarely use any assistant,
Thats aleks hoodie from cowchop,
GoG Volume 2 IM HYPED,
Yay  Nepal WHO ARE FROM NEPAL ,
Hey bro good video as always didnt know the command for photos i took yesterday it opens google photos cool stuff,
Mark Sucker Burg,
Bixby,
Marques make me a sandwich Google Assistant poof your a sandwich straight out of Compton plays in the background,
Whos the President of USA Barrack Obama You wish,
Through much of the video you present a clear bias towards Siri even though Google Assistant is performing better Overall,
you lost me after 805 cause your currently a sandwich and sandwiches cant talk,
Google Assistant can sing Happy Birthday and Lullaby Siri cannot,
woow bro  fianally i got to hear my countrys name NEPAL thanks marques D,
Google is a much better company with much more superior technology to apple,
Siri was severely dumbed down ever since iOS 9 iOS 10 she is practically a vegetable She used to be more life like make you feel like you are talking to a real person And I swear she cant seem to answer some questions that she was able to do back in iOS 8,
There is no reason to debate if Google Assistant is better than Siri Siri uses Bing for searches,
Hearing name of Nepal does satisfyIm from Nepal here ,
Siri is the bomb,
why nepal,
you dont have any problem when you have bothMKBHD,
Who agrees that if you say OK Google When Siri is active Siri should ask Are you cheating on me,
Google Assistant is now available on iOS **mic drop**,
POOF Now your a sandwich,
lol I once asked siri to drop me a beat and she replied hold on I know a guy who can then seconds later a guy starts beatboxing,
Thanks for mentioning nepal,
Thanks for Mentioning Nepal,
Your videos are great I had watched almost all of your videos,
Siri Is Like Your Friend Just Says You I Dont KnowXD,
yes well have to see how they perform in 2020,
The way you said Nepal,
to know full descriptive ans you can google itit is just an assistant and short answers are expected where Google assistant is way more better than siri,
BRO you did it again again and again a real tech video that is sooo fucking interesting ty marques,
This is such a wellputtogether video Really didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did,
Siri showing on its screen mark suckerberg lol,
Assistant is definitely more accurate in getting your answer correct but Siri gives those awesome infographicsimagesextras that you didnt ask for but may have would be great to combine both,
Greeting from Nepal Marques,
Mark sucker burg lmao,
445 THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL,
Man any type of thing like this if I use it itll never work,
As an apple user I think the nexus did better I think Siri in a whole is better but the nexus did a better job giving the same information when asked differently But after this video I tried the same questions and got an insanely fast response from Siri and she became more conversational Possible apple fixed this after this video was made,
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,
Google assistant is a huge leap from Google now It shows how fast Google is innovating Google assistant wins hands down,
LOL Siri is very funny Mark Suckerberg,
Setting up Siri for me barely works let alone using her daily,
I m frm nepal And the capital of nepal is kathmandu Big fan from nepal dude MKHD,
Google Assistant is also funny I think both are good Siri vs Google the battle will go on ,
You are being too nice here Marques I am an apple fan boy but I gotta say Siri Sucks Its clear Google is the better AI dont sugarcoat it,
Youre a sandwich oh ok,
Google Assistant is the best,
Thank you for the comparison,
752 Youre a sandwich,
529 Who is Mark Zuckerberg *Cortana* Who is Mark Zuckerberg *Siri* Who is Mark sucker burg IM CRYING XD,
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,
Guardians of the galaxy v2 is everywhere,
what is your intro music ,
Siri gave the more accurate height of Obama obvious winner,
Im a massive apple fan but Siri is straight up garbage compared to google assistant,
440 Mitochondria Darkk_Mane ,
Didnt marked the difference but i m very glad that you mentioned our country name Nepal thankx a ton ,
Im from Nepal Happy that you talked about Nepal,
I asked her which do you like better android or iphone she said  I am an android fan but I might be biased,
Siri Who is mark sucker burg XDDD,
who is Siri Google assistant shes witty,
I asked to google I think you are better than Siri She saidSiri is best Siri I am yours being an assistant is hard work,
To be honest i only use Siri to turn off all my alarms,
Google assistant is more advanced and accurate But siris UI is better in my opinion,
I love my motorola startac,
How tall is the United States *I DIED xD*,
I wonder what google says if you ask whats 00,
440 *MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL*,
MITOCHONDRIA is the powerhouse of the cell,
make me a sandwich  Poof Youre a sandwich hahaha good one google,
hey you black go back in your own country Afrika,
My wife uses Siri and I use Google assistant Its a house divided,
How tall is United States _,
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,
What equipment and lens you use for your video It looks so sharp,
Me i love you Siri i have a boyfriend,
Me  do you have a pet Siri Siri  I have an angry bird,
did i hear that right Siri uses Bing search,
Mitochondria is plural,
I really enjoy your videos Right to the point and very fun to watch,
When askedMake me a sandwich Google assistant literally repliedPoof You are a sandwich Thats kinda amazing,
love when siri says u r a sandwich,
Siri used to be better but Google has passed it in recent years Apple was the first off the line but Google has more than passed it by now,
I decided to ask my Pixel the same questions and it was a second or so faster than yours Must have updated since October Nice to know theyre pushing it to the limits,
ah the beauty of having the Google assistant on a non pixel device,
Thak you for talking about Nepal,
Bixby is the future The secret to Bixby is the system actually writes its own code In contrast to any other similar system It is a profound and monumental giant leap forward Dynamically Evolving Cognitive Architecture The structure of the Voice First world is held together by Intelligent Agents Intelligent Agents use AI Artificial Intelligence and ML Machine Learning to decode volition and intent from an analyzed phrase or sentence The AI in most current generation systems like Siri Echo and Cortana focuses on speaker independent word recognition and to some extent the intent of predefined words or phrases that have a hard coded connection to a domain expertise Bixby uses a patented 1 exponential self learning system as opposed to the linear programed systems currently used by systems like Siri Echo and Cortana What this means is that the technology in use by Bixby is orders of magnitude more powerful because Bixbys operational software requires just a few lines of seed code to establish the domain 2 ontology 3 and taxonomy 4 to operate on a word or phrase In the old paradigm each task or skill in Siri Echo and Cortana needed to be hard coded by the developer and siloed in to itself with little connection to the entire custom lexicon of domains custom programmed This means that these systems are limited to how fast and how large they can scale Ultimately each silo can contact though related ontologies and taxonomies but it is highly inefficient At some point the lexicon of words and phrases will become a very large task to maintain and update Bixby solves this rather large problem with simplicity for both the system and the developer Specimen of the developer console identifying domain intent programing Bixbys team calls this new paradigm the Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system There is limited public information on the system and I can not address any private information I may have access to However the patent Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system based on thirdparty developers 5 published on December 24th 2014 offers an incredible insight on the future Bixby Has Built An Easy Way For Developers To Build This Bixby patent is a landmark advance for Intelligent Agents and the resulting Voice First devices and uses case that will be developed on the platform The process for adding new domain experience is a simple process in the developer app To define a new intent the domain is established by programing a horizontal flow chart that helps to define ontology and taxonomy with in the entire system The results are lines of code that will forever be dynamically changing and connecting as more domains of intent are established Bixby literally programs itself This is process is related to self modifying code that has been around since the 1960s from assembly language to Cobol However the process that Bixby uses is radically more advanced The limitations we have all come to know with Siri Echo and Cortana and the Chat Bots released with Facebook M are tied to the limitations of extending new intent domains and connecting new ontologies and taxonomies Not only does each intent domain need to be programed from decoding a word or phrase but these silos of intents need to some how connect when more complex sentences are created For example SiriAlexa I want to pick up a Pizza on the way to my girl friends house and I would like to find a perfect wine to pick up along the way Also would like to bring her flowers Currently Siri and Alexa could not understand the intent of this paragraph nor could it easy connect to the six domains and many ontologies to produce a useful result Bixby could learn this in a few minutes and constantly connect with new intent domains by expanding the ontological references each domain represents Another feature of Bixby will be the user profile that defines Conversational intentUnderstands What You Say Location context Time context Task context Dialog context Understands You Learns and acts on personal information Who are your friends Where do you live What is your age What do you like You will set privacy fences around any information that Bixby learns and you will be able to choose to allow the system to share this data with any intent domain Of course security and privacy will always be an issue with Intelligent Agents and Bixby is working on a new model that will quickly define what is logically private and potentially shareable with permissions,
Watching in full 144p,
I like this intros songplease make it often,
Watching this in 2017 sad because the president is now an angry overpriced offbrand cheeto,
Hey man you asked the Capital of my country And the time shown is used all over the country we only have one time zone all over the country,
Its unfair you really want siri to win this time,
The Pixel was not parallel to that partition line,
What he said hey whazzup guys mkbhd here what auto generated captions said hey whats up guys im kitty hd he,
What is the capital of Nepal  Kathmandu ,
I think therefore I am but lets not put the cart before the horse Savage,
Google assistant is better overall but I really like Siris interface it looks way cooler and technological,
How tall is the United States Mm about 1000 miles No one asked for that but there you are,
nice aesthetic setup and i really digging into the intro the song and montage was really your mkbhd trademark Ive been following you seen the OnePlus one because and a big OnePlus fan keep on the good work,
You should be more neutral while doing the tests,
i love this mkbhd intro as fuckk,
hey Marques bro im from Kathmandu Nepal  Thank you so much for asking Google Assistant and Siri about Nepal and mentioning our country Much Appreciate it ,
I was desperately waiting for this video thanks buddy,
You live in Jersey city dude Lets catch up sometime I live in Newport area,
who is the president of USA Donald trump nooooooo hahahaha,
Google for sure Although Im willing to try something new and innovative,
Screw you all SVoice is the best,
Im a fan of Siri because she is funny and sarcastic,
Google assistant has improved a lot i am loving it,
Open Instagram Trump appears HES EVERYWHERE AAAAAAAH,
Great review I agree with your conclusions,
Do a Cortana vs Google Assistant,
I use both Siri for easy use Google for fun and serious,
Only 2 thinks my phone dont know its Samusung Galaxi S4 mini,
Poof youre a sandwich,
Idk what it is but my Siri is not even as smart as the one shown here What settings do I need to check,
What did the monster eat first after it had its teeth checked The dentist,
I believe someone asked me this the other day How tall is the United States,
Siri was slightly faster the whole time as responded just as well but people are still saying Google is better sheep,
Cortana  Intern Siri  Personal Assistant Google Assistant  Best friend,
android will always be better than ios,
Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 hasnt been rated yet,
755 A funny moment came from google assistant Your a sandwich LOL,
Did he ask what is the capital of Nepal He surely did lol I love your videos and my birth place in Nepal Currently living in Australia,
Google Assistant decimated Siri,
he was so biased in advantage to siri,
Thanks Nepal Is My Country,
Clippers fan,
You shouldve asked google to sing happy birthday absolutely nails it xD,
Oh poor Siri what have you done lol,
Someone knows a link for the background photo from the google pixel,
Fashion cholesterol poetry giant pressure coach,
And i didnt expect you to ask about Nepal D M Nepalese,
SIRI WAS THE BEST AND WILL REMAIN THE BEST ASSISTANT EVER,
Make me a sandwich Google Your sandwich I was shock hahaha,
This is what cortana said about siri I think its cool that shes out there trying to make peoples lives a little easier and for google It doesnt have much to say but its helpful,
If only I could use this on my Galaxy S7 without turning on the screen first,
siri is the best voice assistant inbuilt but google is best in search,
Make me a sandwich lmao,
You should ask Google Assistant to sing or to give me a beat,
watching this video while I asked Google Assistant Siri or Google Assistant,
i asked googlehey siri googleroses ar red violets ar blue apples ar sweet and siri is to haha so sweet,
Great Job Marques  I just love this video  I am pretty sure that these assistants have a great future ahead as they keep improving over the years  This just the beginning so I feel youve done a great job making this video  Ten years down the line we will see this video and remember how they all started  Love your work  Keep producing these kind of historical stuff ,
*Is it just me or did Siri sound irritated by the random questions at the end Lol Marques How tall is Mark Zuckerbergs wife Siri I DONT KNOW*,
Marquesmake me a sandwich Google Poof Youre a sandwich MeROFL,
n 2050 phones might be compring the capabillities of their human slave assistants,
Now are ANY of them completely touchfree like in Motorola devices always listening for OK MOTO and you dont even have to touch the phone for nothing If either Google Assistant or iPhone have it Im sold and with stock apps Im NOT asking for an IF I get an app for it,
He wants Siri to be better so bad Sounds desperate at times to justify every observed flaw Whos his babys Mama  SEE GOOGLE DONT KNOW MAN HAD TO STOP Fanboyism is real,
I have Apple and Siri flat out SUCKS compared to Google assistant,
Google assistant feels more alive while siri is just a robot,
Yo yo,
Hey Marques Have you been to Nepal,
Siri kept telling me Its nice of you to ask but it doesnt really matter what I think when I was trying to have a conversation with her XD And for me she couldnt tell Whats going on,
Make me a sandwhich *Tadaa* You are a sandwhich,
i thought this was going to be like Google talking to Siri XD,
BEN KEND M KENDM GRRM  TELEFONA KARIYIM  MANDIRA FLOZOFU  ,
Always enjoy your reviews  thank you,
j7 prime siri install,
The last time Siri and Google will ever say that the President of America is Obama,
He completely seems to be taking Apples side After all you people go to Google to search stuff,
Siri with how tall is the United States had me dying,
Omg I was so happy when he asked about Nepal Because I am a Nepali,
Siris big problem  cannot command call phone,
Siri looks dope though,
I think both of em are great they are not something that get in the way when you are deciding what to buy youll get used to them eventually,
ouh my google assistant is so cuteee ,
MKBHD plz do one video on S voice Ty,
MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL,
Google Assistant Looks great but they really should just build it into google now Google has a tenancy to make many different products that do the same thing such as Allo Duo Hangouts and Messenger All they should have is one app for each general purpose,
hey i am from Nepal,
Actually its trump XD,
739 lol arabs talking about soccer thats what trending on twitter,
at the end if I tell Google assistant im feeling lucky it starts a trivia game show,
the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell Darkkmane,
I love how apple defaults to bing instead of google We would rather work with microsoft than google lol,
assistant open Instagramand Mr President shows up,
Google Assistant,
its that guy that people memed the shit out of after will smith talked about him in rewind,
marques in LG ad just before the video,
Thx so much for talking about nepal,
i loved when he ask about nepal,
Unskippable ads MOTHERFUCKERS UNSUBSCRIBED INSTANTLY,
Siri doesnt understand my accent like google does,
can you do a review on the asus zenwatch 3,
Wow your a genius,
shout out from Nepal ,
Oh you just talk about Nepal thats nice I am from Nepal,
They both performed surprisingly well but the Google assistant sounded more human like,
From Nepal D,
450 nepal,
hey MKBHD thank you so much for all the content you provide us with Ive been watching you for a long time both of these personal assistants are great but Google is my absolute favorite again thanks for all the great content and youre awesome for your dedication,
google oh also whos watching this in 2017,
im from Kathmandu Nepal,
Hey dude I am from kathmandu nepal and I love my contry,
Siri is so much faster Love Apple,
How to download Siri Android,
Hey Siri do you like android,
It took 10 years for Apple to be like an apple,
This is racist what about green apples,
front should really be black,
Screen should be black black and red all in all with red touch id or black,
Looks like a fantastic canvas for artwork,
This iPhone makes YG proud,
Red and White is more like Purity and hope while red and black would send a very strong different message so maybe thats why its not black its not about the phone its about the donation apple making SMH,
Apple has no clue what to come up with after Steve jobs passed awaywhat a shame,
I want but i have a other good phone and cant buy this,
They should put a red ring around the home button,
Apple took 10 years to look like the real one,
What about the crips tho This aint fair,
soo it looks like a white iPhone in a red case,
For those that do not know Red and White represent the colors of blood cells which are affected when HIV infection occurs just saying Do I win an iPhone Haha,
Finally Apple looks exactly like an apple,
If apple put red home button I think it will be more beautiful,
Who the hell cares what it looks like when basically everyone puts a case on their phone,
I wonder how long until techrax pours some kind of liquid on this,
Roses are red Violets are blue The back is red So why wasnt the front too,
lmaoTook Apple 10 years to finally be like an apple,
Unique I like huawei p10 too for the green colour,
Instructions not clear I put airplane mode and threw my iphone from 12th floor but it didnt fly,
Took them 7 years to make Iphone look just like an Apple,
Still no Matt white ,
We removed the headphone jack so we could have room for the red,
WTF LOVE IT ITS GONNA BE MY NEXT REVIEW,
I agree with with your opinion on front black color Good smart review man Keep it up,
Whats next a blue iphone,
i agree about the white front  i really hate it  there is nothing special or luxurious about it  so simple and ordinary the only ting i like about i phone is the back lol,
would look 100x Better if it had a black front,
I would have been surprised if I hadnt seen a red phone before *Cough HTC 10 cough * Nice update Apple so Unique,
Unbox Therapy video was so cool,
meanwhile in Apple Headquarters U saw that S8 pretty cool ah apple   Make it Red xD,
No ew Why the front not blackWTH,
Yup hes right a black front panel wouldve been better,
MKBHD is the best in terms of video quality Keep it up man,
Actually love the white front together with red back,
Ive been waiting for a matte Navy Blue one to drop Apple needs to make customized phones and then they will own the game,
I just got this phone yesterday LOVE IT already,
I talked to a few people who were super excited until they saw the front Blackred would have really been amazing,
great video really amazing two of my top three youtubers making a video together awesome colab keep up the good work,
I heard about more Better camera quality n about battery also or its same as what I hv 7 plus  If possible Rep bro thank you so much,
somehow this video started playing just because Im not an iPhone user or a fan but for some reason I continue watching it and right at the moment you turned it my thoughts was straight up white front just destroyed it,
He makes the iPhone 7 look tiny with his huge hands,
Ive been saving up for this colour iPhone I really love the colour so muchit looks so good,
colorware is there for the black front,
The silver ring in the front matches the silver apple on the back Bingo Thanks Apple PS Thanks for the great job on the Casey N posting,
Your avatar is red and white just sayin I totally agree with you the front shouldve been black bezel and if it was Id be ordering one right now Thanks for the great vid as always,
The black front would look so much better And what in the world is up with the silver TouchID ring How are these things not thought through *sigh*,
Man why change the intro music Really liked the previous one,
They should make the front black,
OMG I need one,
Sorry apple but Samsung is winning nice try,
Red is kinda my favourite colour,
i like i phone but its very costly,
Nice on getting it early,
Hey Marques i love your videos big fan of you and the way you understand technology and make us understand it keep doing more videos i am always eager to see more videos from your channel Good luck for the future,
the white front makes it look like a candycane tf,
Again a waste of time  MKBHD 2017,
Red Ring with a black front cover would be,
I cant wait to upgrade I like my phone but I really want to make the switch to iPhone,
Meanwhile apple was announcing the red iPhone 7 MKBHD already got one,
First red Apple iPhone product Did they forget about the iPhone 5c,
hope the camera does this justice while shooting with a 30000 camera,
That Desk organization is SOOO satisfying,
I jus ordered red skin for my 7 plus thru the link in the description  thanks,
Red and black wouldve DEFINITELY looked much better Stupid Apple,
Same outdated huge bezel internal specs screen but now in redfor 1000 No thanks its the S8 plus for me a phone with 2017 specs better screen and internals,
Apple should make more colours like this Imagine green or blue Dude then you want iPhone 7C,
Was that your OnePlus 3T vibrating at 150 MKBHD,
Hit Like For The Best Techie Marques,
I really dont understand why the front is not black,
MKBHD i would just like to say that I will stop watching and everything else to reviewers that gets EARLY ACCESS to manufacturers device Because this EARLY ACCESS is in a way a form of payment to you Which leads to bias It leads to video formats that is less critical to the product For example instead of making a bend drop test or comparison review of the early access device you tend to go with a safer format video where you talk about iphone features you didnt know about  At the end of the day no manufacturer will let you have early access and them not benefitting from it I can see that you still have little criticisms however I can tell that its more for making the overall early access video legitimacy because it will sound like you are kissing their backside The gist of it is early access comes at a price and thats making a video thats balancing the benefits of maintaining that relationship with the manufacturers while at the same time critiquing but in a way thats not making it sound like this device is so lame Or sticking to a video format thats overall safe like the example I gave earlier So i will avoid viewing videos from youtubers that get early access Il only watch video reviews from reviewers that are not clouded by viewerships And focus on the critiquing side coz those benefits the consumers You should make a video of the in and outs  all details of how early access works for you And how you play with the balance of reviewing and not hurting the manufacturers that gives you early access Viewers need to know,
But you used to think AudioTechnica M50x headphones sounded good,
To much noise on background whos cleaning the room,
Marques when is the 2017 IPad Coming  and when are you about to review it ,
yep true they should made the front black not white,
the quality of your videos is amazing,
great job brojust watched a couple of your videos and u just earned another subscriber,
U should try some handlotion youre always in the screen with your hands they look really dry,
Omg I just realised it looks like the red 2ds,
seems like a poor use of space,
I can just imagine apple injecting aids into their employees and making a cycle to make sure all the charity money goes to them,
Tbh my OCD would kick in and I would have to use red wallpapers,
your video quality is amazing,
Samsung  Lets give it a better screen lets improve the camera and the performance of the device Apple  lets make it red,
Because courage,
N O H E A D P H O N E J A C K SMH,
Great video I use regularly the red cover from Apple but this iPhone looks amazing,
saut,
Why would people buy it half the people who buy it are gonna put a case on it,
That white front is a deal breaker for me,
I think u should say the super slow charger,
It match with the state of its battery always in red,
youre totally right about the white front its a dealbreaker for me,
you should do a product red iphone 7 giveaway,
I wonder how crips feel about the new color,
Red Apple stickers wouldve been genius Missed opportunity,
If the display from the red iphone was black i would have ordered it Xd what a coincidence as soon as i wrote this this guy said it lol,
Apple is the pioneer of innovation woohoo,
Ordered mine already should get Wednesday,
A black front would have been very welcome or even a red front,
The best red iPhone video because we can actually see the color Others just do color change and it gets a new tile of red Good video fam,
Lol its 100 dollars extra just to paint it red,
why is it that 144p looks good on your channel,
needle age friendly painting democratic character,
The front is white what a fail They cant use the black front because the black iPhones are selling much better then the white ones so this is an attempt to get rid of their overstock of white front panels,
Totally agree why didnt they make it with a black front and red ring,
I think I heard his phone go off at 150 XD LOL and this is a sick looking color by the way,
Next in line should be a product red macbook pro,
What are you doing with all these iPhones What are you going to do with them,
Would you consider the white front panel a waste of space,
They should infuse it with the gold colour and black colour Gold apple logo and buttons rims Black screen and Red back,
Just got mine can confirm is beautiful,
Momwhat do you want for your bday MeiPhone 7 red D Mom*POSTS A PIC OF SON ON EBAY*,
God apple You finally change the backside color but keep the horrible white front,
Not gonna lie the iPhone is still one of the most sexiest phones on the market but no headphone jack is still a major turn off,
wat kind of job do tech reviewers got i wanna know  if u dont want that iPhone no more or got a spare 1 hit my email man i hate beimg broke,
alREaDy in the begging he says it,
Marquis face like Im not sayin I they listen to what I tell them but,
Just imagine how nice it would look if the screen was black with a shiny red home button ring,
Anyone else hear the phone vibrating at 150 ,
Glaz protection is great,
1000 likes for iPhone 7 RED DEAL,
You know apple should make a collection of different coloured iphones,
Ive already got the Product RED case for my 6S Plus no deal,
80 of comments be like I HATE THAT THE FRONT IS WHITE 15 of comments be like like this if you agree 5  of comments be like I like the white front including me,
Apple took 10 years to finally be like an apple,
Damn I love it Should sell my jet black and get this one,
just randomly pulls out three iPhones,
All of a sudden I want to go to Target lol,
brother plz organize a giveaway of the same,
*buys red iphone *puts case on it,

Loved Lous response on Unbox Therapy Just another iPhone,
Why would I buy it If yall have an iPhone 6 or 6 plus just put on it a red sticker with the shape of the 7 or 7 plus and say you bought it And if you have an iPhone 7 just put on it a red sticker Im smart lmao,
bro Dm me syedkhubaib at instagram,
Wow its REALLY red ________________________,
cant believe this is a new color Theyre called Apple lol,
a new color Apple is so innovative,
They retracted all the unsold ones and put a new cover on genius Cant wait til food companies do that with their expired foods,
HTC 10 Camilla red,
It wouldve been something special if the whole phone front and back was red,
Apples 2017 Innovation new back color,
OMG why does everyone keep opening the PLUS why not just the iPhone 7 red,
Do you have a link for the red skin on the Black iPhone Thanks in advance,
mkbhd you didnt get it mate Having white instead of black top is a breakthrough madness,
IMO When IPhone 8 is releasedThis red colour should not be special edition for HIV Prevention but a normal colourBut this time with a black front,
im so sad that front is white ,
so beautiful but i live in Brazil  buy one is almost impossible,
whats that notebook on your desk when you unbox,
What u do with all these phones on ur channel,
I think they made the back Red and front White because it resembles the actual apple fruit innovation,
IPhone 7 red tube edition,
Apples logic Lets just make the back red only,
Also Apple did the same color with the refresh iPod trademarkrunsred,
I actually used the collocation red iPhone as a code for periods and now its real,
Apple Fans Be like Apple made another great phone android fans  ohhh wow a red iphone,
No red ear buds No red charging cable No red sticker No red SIM card ejector No red Touch ID ring No respect,
Helpp Red or Jet black,

yo Marques can I barrow an iPhone 7 or 6 anything,
I DO DAILY VIDEOS IN NYC,
It reminds me that Simpson episode where Lisa developed Lisa lion heart doll and it was crushed by te new Stacy Malibu which was the same doll with a new hat oh the people,
The white front is a deal breaker for me Hope the next installation the have a red and black combo,
can U really do any more apple related video when did U become such an isheep,

I hope the camera can do it justice Marques if your camera cant do it then NO camera can,
Finally my best c,
DUDES GOT A TESLA,
why cant apple make a black screen Gold with a white screen Red with a white screen MAKES ME SO MAD,
watch this after unbox therapy LOL,
I am more impressed by that RED 8K sensor zoom capability,
Oh well I already have the iPhone 7 in rose gold but the new red color looks very nice,
Would be pretty cool if the earbuds the charger and adapter were red too,
This guy has more subs than view here,
give me that phone please  you have to much iphone ,
wow he managed to advertise dbrand on this video,
The Will Smith army will get you,
HTC did it 3 years ago with the One M8,
The black would be amazing and stylish,
thanks for the unboxingthinking of buying it,
Here after watching you in casey neistats video,
FINALLY THE APPLE IS RED,
I came over from casey neistat video to see his new red iphone,
450 min video for a new color D,
That intro was sick that music and the way you walked into it just oooooooooh so juicy,
heeey Marques could you please talk about the New Ipad from apple and give us some more information about it  thats would be awesome piece,
Apple used 10years to do a product like an apple,
Watched this video after watching unbox therapys iPhone red review This video is now hilarious to me,
He says you need two iPhones to make a proper mkbhd edition but the doctor says you need at least one kidney,
Let me guess It will cost 100200 dollars more than the regular one because the synthetic chemistry involved in producing an hexapolymetarizedionblending configuration required gazillion of resource in research and developmenthere we go,
its so cool,
hi sir I really love watching your videos  I need a iPhone can you give me a iPhone please,
U can put a gold apple and screen to make it an IRON MAN PHONE,
I love when thay combine White with this Matte Red Dont need the black display,
Now theyre doing black front  D,
Nice video Also like the fact that you rotate it so we can see all all sides Have a sub and a like my good man,
Yea Iphone should be red its an apple duh nice really,
Should definitely have black front bezels would be so clean and crispy,
Would have been great if the ring around the home bottom was red like brain C said and the earbuds along with the charger equipment was red,
wow new innovation change colors Im surprised,
Its just a red phone nothing special Unbox therapy had the same reaction as me,
amazing review  i like the Red Iphone always wish to have one,
the black front does look way better,
Do I get red iphone smaller size s8 or keep rocking 6plus for now Im baffled,
I would change my galaxy for one of does just for the color Wow,
Or add a red skin to your phone Whatever works I guess,
Hey Marques do you prefer iOS or Android Which do you think is better for every day tasks  And whats your daily driver,
I cant understand why they made home button ring silver  Wth,
 shot with a RED camera,
The RED iPhone indeed looks beautiful and youre correct when you say the front should have been red as well The white front does look out of place Anyways always enjoy your videos and reviewThanks man keep it up,
I like to buy a skin from that website Is it sure ,
a phone to match your red Cameralls,
Just looks like a huge iPod Touch,
Would be nice if the front was red too Or maybe black with red trim on the front,
go to unbox therapy and learn your lesson,
its Fine im gonna buy rose gold,
I just got this yesterday Its so nice after upgrading from a 5c,
This IS the official MKBHD edition Red and White is exactly the same as the profile photo Btw redblack  powerful dynamic  aggresive think loud explosive speakers a powerful ferrari with black tinted windows or Beats logo etc redwhite  pure sincere  clean just as youd expect when it comes to healthcare as you can see on almost anything related to it like the red crescent logo hospital symbol or ambulances etc I think it just suits the purpose of this new phone which is a Product Red edition and it feels more like Apple being clean and calm as you can see theyre not as aggressive as other companies when it comes to adopting new technologies Its all psychology and colors OnePlus used red and black in order to break into the market and to appear as a bold and powerful brand Samsung used blue to tell that theyre reliable and stable Apple is all white to show they are clean and simple straightforward and have products that are very easy to use so as to appeal to the average consumer But anyway those are just my own thoughts and in my own words Im sure there are others who can explain what I mean much better than me as English isnt my first language,
I found your channel through Casey neistat,
i want a red iphone 7,
Apple is red Samsung is blue Both are cool So are you,
Hint its just a red iPhone,
joke of the monthpoor use of space,
Beautiful if you look at from the back LMAO,

The box looks amazing but the phone nah,
Should have RED Airpods charger and everything Cmon,

white and red just perfect,
I love the white screen actually Also the headphone jack jokes are getting old Android users are always so bitter lol,
efficient behavior commission insight black impose gather motivate versus,
Apple wireless is the future but theres no wireless charging,

Tbh you can just put a red iPhone cover,
My Honor 8 is still one of the most photogenic,
not a deal breaker is a deal breaker for me,
and that just normal iphone 7 with red color,
No HEADPHONE JACK,
Dude Youre videos are ,
Its all great until you flip the front of the phone like YOU HAD ONE JOB APPLE ,
I think I wouldve enjoyed it more if it was a glossy finish like the jet black iphone 7,
I just got this iPhone and in person its amazing Saw it in the store and it was love at first sight,
Finally they made a product what apple should look like,
You are so fine,
Can you put a link for where you got the shirt from,
Not an Apple fan but this does look really nice,
Y they didnt do the front too full Red that would be nice,
*google*  we are working on quantum computer *microsoft* we are trying to make a single OS on mobile as well as pc *apple*  lets make a *red* iphonetrue innovation,
I cant believe I just watched a video for a review of a colour,
i 7 red but black front is the best,
Hey Marques I just stopped by to say that is very important to youtubers  mostly the tech ones  to acknowledge a meaning on these RED products It may be ironical because Apple its an utterly capitalist company but even so cares about raising awareness and funds to HIVAIDS in poor Africa countries which is very important Thanks to use your influence to show nice contents and keep doing this great job,
Is this apple trying to soften the coming blow of the s8,
WoW Looks_Gr8 Lucky if i get a chance 2 see 1 of them,
They should make the apple sign on the back blue,
Holly shit thats a beautifully red,
Red pffff Mines invisible,
They should have done this sooner I mean an apple is red,
want one been waiting for a red iphone gonna break my back just to get my hands on one,
I think the red and black would look good on the Google Pixel,
harga jaBerpa hp di jamin ga mas bule,
This Video Is Crispy AF,
Weve reached a point where the thing that Apple makes people excited about is a new colour What a shame,
Red with black nice dreamz,
Damn He yoinked that box at 150,
For me the most beautiful iphone ,
I prefer rose gold Ngl,
Why does Apple have to make all the colored iPhones with a white front panel Dont they know that red and black is the best color combination,
SamsungWith our overpowering tech how do you think you can beat us AppleNow our phones comes in red,
Look at all these hiveminded comments doesnt ANYONE think for themselves any more Come up with some original thoughts process and analyse them for stupidity and humility THEN post them Doh,
Nice,
Whats the music in the intro,
Wow What a great idea by Apple as always trying to push the limits of design and bringing the user the best experience possible Good job Apple you never disappoint sponsored comment,
i think we all can agree apple should have made the white front black smh,
it took them 10 yrs to make the colour of appleswow,
Marques whats your awesome notebook in this video,
Hey U know Im not even into iphones I only watch your videos for those crazy shots and that astonishing quality I get excited every time a new video comes up keep up with the awesome work,
apple will find a way to tell people they created the colour red,
so if I put my condom on it I cant see the red anymore what a good idea,
Those are some really cinematic shots like 2 and a half minutes in,
I was actually surprised how good the skin looked in the video like if you think so too,
Is this limited edition or out forever,
saw the amazing red on back wow saw the white on front why,
The Apple logo should be red,
wow apple introduced a new colorthat has never been done before,
Its too bad the red isnt on the front instead of white I hope Apple starts making phonesipods full colors,
that is such an innovation apple is leading on innovation great work apple boring technology products ,
i wish it was in red and black  call it DEADPOOL edition,
I still have an ophone 4,
What if they made a green iPhone Like really theres a red type of apple and green type of apple,
If a Tesla gets stolen is it called a Edison,
I hope Microsoft doesnt make an electric car the updates would be hell,
One year later Hubble Space Telescope first impressions,
Tesla and Porsche had a baby,
its like a computer on wheels more like Stephen Hawking,
This boi talked to Elon personally and is very casual about it Damn,
I believe that they should have added a HUD infront of the driver seat because it will still be abit distracting to look on the right all the time to see the speed,
so basically if something goes wrong with the touchscreenyoure fcked,
Still want a screen that shows speed in front of me,
Cant wait to buy an used model 3 for 13 the price,
It feels like a Tesla it drives like a Tesla it looks like a Tesla Is it a Tesla by any chance,
Minimalist Electric Vegan Sold,
I love Tesla they start cheap and charge you for every option 5k lol,
Does it have a quantum carburetor,
Should be minimalist in a VW Beetle way but ends up being minimal in an Apple way which is kinda sad,
so what was that bird doing,
Me and my dad where driving around space X in Hawthorne we saw a red tesla model 3 with a black model X following it my dad said the model X was security and he thinks that the red tesla could have been elon musk,
Thanks for not showing driving impressions We dont need those,
Model S Model 3 Model X S3X,
Your reviews are amazing Im pissed i havent seen your channel sooner Keep up the good work,
That was a lot of information but my favorite was  What is that bird doing,
Nothing beats a big fat AMG v8 D,
Next thing you know people will be paying to have ads displayed on the screen,
Why would you want to see your leftright indicator control lights anyway I think we can do without Its good that tesla throws conventions out the window But indeed it is important to optimize the design to the user So perhaps it would be better if some vital data is projected in front of the driver eg on the windscreen or the dash like speed And fine tune some of the controls wrt ease of use vs simplicity I mean moving everything to software is an interesting development opening up new possibilities and is probably cheaper in production  but it should not get in the way of the ease of use What if there is sn emergency and you need to get something from your glove compartment in a splitvsecond under a lot of stress You dont want to be forced to navigate through some computer screens then So as always a design must be clever  thinking of all use cases,
You can even play your Nintendo Switch on the way to work,
Can you do voice demands Like Ok Tesla open glove compartment,
Shout out to Elon Musk,
Make a nintendo switch review,
we cant wait for our model 3  nice video but when are you gonna drive one and review the drive experience,
Did you get a Iwannatakeovertheworld vibe when talking with Elon,
Model 3 look more modern and better design look,
Thanks for the review YES I hope to get a Tesla some day,
whats the point of doing a car review when you dont drive the car,
So practically you cant drive the car if the screen gets some complaint,
Why am I watching this I cant even afford the tyres of this car,
Its still way too expensive dude,
I got a BMW ad before this,
Save us Elon,
Im getting it for sure ,
what is that bird doing,
tesla 3 cest super on attend tesla pickup,
Technology is awesome Cant wait to see what the future holds,
I hate how cars pollute the planet I hate how Tesla is becoming car worlds apple Premium ecars for premium polluter who simply dont care Take a bike,
Thank you for creating such a good informative video Your views and subscribers speak to how clearly you present your info I also appreciated the bird ADD moment,
WHAT WAS THAT BIRD DOING MARQUES,
Great info love your style man thanks as always,
Hi officer I know you need to see my license and registration but unfortunately I have to press a button on my screen to open up the glove department and my monitor stop working,
any sort of technology is hackable best cars are who works manually and have buttons,
As always great video man thanks for the upload,
Thank you for your simple test without a ride,
A beautiful car Im excited to see if it really can become the future of the automobile Great video,
A 60000 car is affordable in Silicon Valley perhaps,
Just realised Henry Ford  Model T Elon Musk  Model 3 Sound very similar probably to draw comparisons,
Somebody at Tesla please get Marques a Tesla 3 to show us all,
thank god he used the word clout,
Tesla sport model in the works Ideally mass production of EV more affordable Informative clip Mr Marques,
Marques Im five minutes into your first impressions video and youre still reciting specs and previously announced information When will I get to hear your actual impressions from driving the dang thing,
Wtf  get global Feet Mph Range in miles Go Metric ,
Does it come with a headphone Jack,
Dope Vid Thanx 4 your knowledge,
Bro less talking and more showing its 2017 We dont have time to waste,
That bird was like OMG new Tesla car i must poop on it  ,
I like it it looks promising but are we sure we arent just interpreting minimalism as marketing spin for lack of features I get why but dont act like not having basic features is a feature,
Yes I really hope I get to buy a Tesla some day,
Good job something we have wondered about keep it up,
This was a very excellent and informative review Ive been going back and forth on whether to put down my deposit Great job man,
Reason to get rich 1 BUY THE BEST MODEL OF TESLA CAR,
The hydrogen one video tease on Snapchat Cant wait,
nice video bro very informative  can you please do a Video on The Tesla SemiTruck,
Wait a minute doesnt this guy sell android phones,
Move to Norway  cheap Teslas,
Well done Marques Thanks for sharing your insights,
Who else thought he was in Model 3,
Solution for the always looking to the right for info issue Attach your phone just beyond the steering wheel and run a speedometer app while driving,
Any word on pricing for the premium package,
I cant believe how affordable these actually are,
minimal yes what if the screen gets damaged  lol,
If casey neistat was there his video would have been like THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT I AM NOT BEING PAID BY TESLA at every 5 mins of the videos,
maybe if the glovebox opened with a voice command that would be easier,
next is  thermonuclear hoovering starship first impressions,
I love that the model 3 has simplicity  Now can we expect voice control at some future date,
Thanks for your thoughts I really enjoyed the video but as some not from the US I have to say that imperial units drive me crazy,
So if the touchscreen breaks are you fu*ed,
Dont forget you get a 10k rebate So if you get the 44k its really 34k and then u can slap on 10k worth of options and get everything you want for 44k so pretty much for about 45k you are gonna get the top of the line model 3 Mind you aint no gas baby Free charge Omg people pay 30000 a month on gas alone for a sedan type car Your putting 30000 a month back in your pocket Saving 3k a month add that times 5 years On a 5yr finance youll save 15k in 5yrs,
Correct me if Im wrong but theres no LIDAR in any Teslas They use radar ultrasonic and cameras,
Dude love you bro keep up the great work ,
Dhank you really marques i love u though,
When its in self drive would you have to use of pedal to acceleratebrake ,
Yo mkbhdI have a model 3 you can drive in SF in sept My husband is an employee,
Those touch screens are dangerous because you have to take your eyes off the road to use it At least with dials and buttons you can feel yourself around,
Its great to see this review on the Model 3 Great job,
This car makes no sense For 45k get a 2017 mercedes cclass 300 or eclass,
Great preview Subscribed Good to hear impressions from EV fan and Tesla owner ,
you forgot to say that the main reason concept is that is made with the idea of car sharing Tesla Network and also fully autonomos as you mentioned so any buttons like clovebox could be things that people that share your car could brake or wear from extensive use And having a button for a glovebox means people could access it you might not want that And the car also have a cabin facing camera to eventually monitor the people inside when shared when you look at it that way the design makes more sense,
I can get my M3 as early as January if i get the upgraded battery but ill wait to Q2 2018 and get the base model its still a beautiful car,
Basically I would just want the glass hood and full self driving capabilities so the price would be 50k almost seems like I should just buy a model s instead,
if I lived in ATLANTA I would consider it for sure But Augusta isnt as busyneeded,
I just reviewed this car and its truly amazing I really want one now  ,
Excellent clear update Regards from the UK,
What is that bird doing,
You were a celebrity at the event All of the other channels were trying to sneak you in their shot Congrats on winning,
You should play the piano with those hands,
If Apple had a car would it have windows,
Wow you just sold the Tesla Model 3 tothose that thought theyll never purchase a Tesla myself included,
The Tesla car is a modern day version of the Packard PierceArrow Duesenberg Hudson and Vector,
Its a sign of time when tech geeks are excited about ars instead of gadgets Electric cars are going to take over fast Maybe one vehicle lifetime cycle Maybe 15 cycles,
That bird will poop on yar tesla,
Please make review on model 3 broii,
Great details Very articulate and concise review Well done Mr Brownlee,
Tesla evangelist,
Everything is simple Needs software to open the glove compartment,
Ill be reading your responses and replying below he said yeah right,
Considering the gas and oil and pollution Count me in TESLA,
GREAT review man  I think Ill buy a used or preowned Model S for around the same price as the Model 3 And the Model S is grandfathered in for Unlimited Free Charging,
waiting for powering the engine but he is still talking D,
Tesla and mkbhd delicious,
what happens to your Model S problem encountered Dec last year  How did Tesla solve it for you ,
I like the Concept of the two screens like the X AND S has and not a single and i hope they keep it when the new gen SX comes up as a Premium Model,
I think I might get a Model 3 after I pay off my current car I want to see them iron out the problems with the early models first plus Id like to save more for a decent down payment But I really like the idea of electric vehicles and the way I commute to work using almost an extra 4050 a week on Gas Id be saving money in the long run,
Thats the best overview of the model three that Ive seen Very excited getting ours Q4,
Who would buy Model 3  I would ,
*T E S L A I S L I F E*,
WHAT WAS THE BIRD DOING MARQUES,
What is that bird doing *Nice car you have there would be a shame if someone were to shit on it*,
im not a fan of the speedometer not in front of you,
Was that intro j Cole change,
Is the center console adjustable to driving angle,
Soooo its the DJI spark equivalent,
I get to help build it Tesla is amazing,
But Can it run Civilizaton IV,
I am definitely going to buy this in my dreams,
What if combustion engines make a comeback maybe some new technology like say duke engines,
Brother doing big things Keep it up,
MKBHD can you do something with the porch mission e Its a brand new electric car concept that will make it into the market by 2020 Just wanted it to get some attention,
WHAT WAS THE BIRD DOING MARQUES,
Halo Like if you felt the memories flowing after seeing that thumbnail,
This is the ultimate antidriver car,
Tesla Model 3 is the iPhone XR of Tesla,
After having a Model S for 2 years and now a Model X for a month If Elon Musk makes it it is worth the money Never felt so happy with a vehicle,
Besides having no instrument panel I like it My next car will certainly be electric and the self driving features are awesome,
35k tesla car is not affordable,
Sells you autonomous car You gotta pay for the 10000 DLC or its gonna be an awkward experience,
Excellent information and very well presented Thanks,
Cant wait to see Tesla Model S 3 X on the road  ,
So Tesla will update the 3 wo cost Why would some one need dual motors You were very informative on your video so Much Thanks,
The interior reminds me of something from the 50s or 60s very simple and almost no buttons Exept bench seats and a thin steering wheel its very similar,
Marques you have awesome reviews I must say thanks for the laugh about the bird I was rolling about your expression about the bird I shared with my wife and she laughed as well thanks for your great reviews again,
voice command would be a great plus for that screen,
Do i need a tempered glass screen protector for the display,
This sounds pretty cool bro,
Halo logo font for the 3 in the thumbnail ,
i got a model 3 yesterday,
Great review Marques Its nice to hear your thoughts being a model S owner Cant wait for the 3,
Cheers for this  have been desperate to learn about the series 3  sounds brilliant,
aye that j cole intro,
Lovin the tesla videos Solid review,
The future of transportation is electrick,
The autopilot will come with software updates Likely after 2020 It may require a hardware upgrade,
Love the change instrumental in the beginning,
The preordre can be canceled with 100 money back no question asked,
Why not 2030 Spacex announces its personalised warp drive It comes with a mobile app that uses open ai The speed is so ridiculous that its not even a point,
Dont let this video make you forget that MKBHD has a working RED Camera phone prototype thats bout to be made a video of,
I love how he subtly brings in the word clout,
Is that a sample from JCole  Change in the intro,
In this game of tech and its hype Africa is close enough but yet so far away,
If its meant for autonomous driving then why doesnt it come standard,
By far the coolest American car company full stop,
So a welloptioned model 3 is going to 50k Ya no thanks thats not interior of even a 35k40k car,
Loling when you cant charge your new Tesla because of Nuclear War,
Great videoinfo Marques I gotta order my 3 asap,
Rear wheel drive car isnt feasible in states that have snow or ice,
What do you call a stolen Tesla An Edison,
Seen loads of Teslas in my small town already but theres not many places to charge in the UK ,
Sounds like a lot of people are mad that hes got the inside scoop with Tesla and got his shit together Got to meet Elon and everything hell yeah that was good info as well Super impressive,
A very very sober and honest review Thank you for sharing,
a zero emissions car that runs on electric from coal burning power plants,
bro you gonna drive the car or just jibber jabber about it,
Nice clean review thanks for being concise and precise My question would be could I be getting Jiggy with my booty call while in Auto Pilot,
Bottom line Best yo take a course on how to drive this car before going out on your own Sound terrific,
Thats insane The car is too simple Nissan Leaf is a fullon electric car at a very affordable price too and it doesnt skip on basic luxuries people expect in a car,
WHAT WAS THAT BIRD DOING I wanna know,
What if someone breaks out your Window And they take the control tablet screen,
Nice job Thanks for this video Go Tesla,
I love how the front of the car looks like the former Porsche Cayman and Boxster Back still has to convince me tho,
is that the halo 3 3 in the thumbnail,
i wouldnt say that he model X is affordable xD,
Marques Brownlee Is the sourcegeneration of electricity to power the Teslas justify using these cars  Along that line add The recycling life of the batteries in the long run  and does that all justify these cars being Ecofriendly and less biofuel hungry ,
can you add closed captions for people who are hearing disabled please,
You talk too much Why dont you show the car,
The lack of a display directly in front on the driver might be a deal breaker for me I dont like the idea of looking off to the side for my speed and directions,
Love how often I hear or see J Cole stuff on this channel lol,
Wasted DONT TALK ABOUT IT SHOW IT,
the lack of a display behind the steering wheel is a deal breaker for me I rely on knowing how fast Im going via a split second glance at the speedometer,
Time for Tesla to build a 30000 P100D,
Can it run crysis 3 tho,
heres a funny joke saleen makes a bodykit for the tesla model s,
Do u wanna help me with changing the edu like to revolutionize them like to teach the middle school students that ICE came from Christiaans invention of guns,
I dont really like the idea of everything being on a single screen sounds odd,
The perfect Tesla would be the Model S with the following improvements  Better sound insulation  Softer suspension  Higher quality interior Thats it spaceship complete,
Stick it to the oil companies They killed the GM electric car 40 years ago,
Nice review You could show us the accelerating of the car in the video,
UGGGHHHH ELON Y u do dis to meeee Now i want one even morrrre,
Why is there no walk aroundinterior footage Just 3rd party photovideo references Youre in the actual car,
Please get to the car details Tooo much talk thts not car related,
Great review  love your presentation style,
I actually dont think the model 3 has LIDAR,
And then most importantly no paying for gas,
Remember when Nokia and Blackberry users bitched about iPhones not having buttons blah blah People dont seem to realize that the UI is optimized strictly for the car Its not like a glued on iPad trying to do 1000 things the functions are very specific,
I gonna order my tesla model 3 next year still waiting to know what price it will sell over here in switzerland and we prob wont get any till 2019,
Saw a tesla x in the UK Gorgeous car,
how is that screen not a crash issue,
You can pay a little bit extra and make it a more expensive car  Understatement of the year,
So you dont have the full car when you buy it you also have to buy DLCs,
Hey man how tall are you cause Im 193cm and generally have to lower my head whenever Im driving Would I be able to sit comfortable in the back as well,
Theyre definitely going to add a voice assistant AI like Siri or Alexa to do most of the work instead of the touchscreen stuff,
Nice presentation Last summer i had the pure pleasure of riding in a Tesla S Damn I understood what owners were going through Man o man So smooth powerful Truly stat of the art,
Driving wont be driving anymore,
Its because you MKBHD are an influencer,
why am i seeing condom ads on your channel before every video ,
I love the fact that near the end of the video a bird totally distracted Marques,
I love EV cars i only travel 150 miles per week 7 days on a single full charge,
The model 3 is basically a DJI Spark,
I wish the screen was more into the car not like popping out Also a speedometer behind the wheel would have been nice thats all is wrong with this car in my opinion,
What is that bird doing lol,
Great Video Man very informative,
This guy thinks hes so smart as if he was part of the design n engineering team,
Rely great reviewI enjoyed itand what was up with that bird,
Im beginning to think Elon musk is actually an AI sent from the future to help guide us,
You will never convince a blind person that you are not a white dude,
lol I missed this yet I live in the same city that the event was held,
From what Ive saw XD,
Would I buy it Yes But ONLY for the powertrain and power storage Currently it is the best you can get Otherwise give me a conventional looking car with great handling refinement and perhaps less technological hubris on the dashboard,
I love what Tesla is doing but my god I like having levers and shit to open the glove box What if the screen goes out,
I love tesla but i still think the Touch screen in the model 3 is a bit  out of place I may get used to it but thats just what i think,
I am sure there will be a Tesla van one day I would buy one,
According to Teslas website dual motor deliveries are suppose to start in Nov 18 I believe If you have a reservation you can check it out,
No LIDAR in the Model 3,
Sounds like something apple would do,
Ironman Mach 3 Armor Initiative,
Love you man,
Got rid of a gmc truck for prius hopefully soon santa will talk Elon i need a Tesla ,
Best review Ive heard yet Answered those little questions like when will we see two motors and what its like to have all the controls shifted to the right,
you talked to elon musk,
I Love it The way you explained the simplicity of not having to many options and variance is what will make the car more affordable and more profitable for the company for example when I go to In out burger their menu is the most straightforward menu of any fast food restaurant If I go to Burger King I am overwhelmed with the different combos and variations of a flame grilled burger,
Im getting mine 1st quarter of 2018,
what about headsup display,
Cheap electric cars are getting good and good electric cars are getting cheap,
Tesla are way ahead of the rest of the field with their electric vehicles,
I like a nice front grill Alfa Romeos have always had a nice one Teslas dont,
Would be interesting to know how the range of the car drops over timeso after three years do you only get half the range Do you get any warrantee on rangebattery life Can you replace batteries without gutting the thing Parked in the sun itll get to 140 degrees in there that lcd screen might melt in the sun placed up there like that Can you read it in the sun Sure is a beautiful design,
I am not ready to buy a car that has its design focused on eliminating the driving experience and the driver,
The exterior looks cool While the interior mainly that dash looks weird like some poorly conceived futuristic golf cart,
Hey Marques anymore Apollo videos coming up Long term use impressions etc,
Center screen is BIG mistake,
what is that bird doing,
Thanks for the runtrhough Im on the list for the Model 3 and have yet to choose options and was wondering what they were exactly so this was very interesting,
I just watched a mkbhd video in 360p,
that guy is wrong about the roof by saying that the basic model versus the premium package is a metal roofin fact every model 3 comes with glass roof an premium package the roof is tinted,
Lol Model S as an affordable car is a joke 100K is an expensive car,
For over 50k I will just buy a used Model S,
well now Im considering to deal with my depression sort shit out become sucessfull and get this car,
How much trust they have in the company Are you kidding me its the same thing as when Apple releases a new phone they dont care they just buy whatever shit that certain companies release These people are not car lovers These are people just following the stream Tesla costs premium money but is still not a premium built car,
I reserved a 3 early last year but sadly it seems because I live in Canada I wont be getting it until the end of 2018,
You doing car reviews now Or just Tesla,
No flux capacitor ,
That monitor goes out for any reason I mean its a single point of failure Doesnt seem safe at all I could be wrong Please tell me Im wrong,
Nice video Thank you man,
No dual motor with Launch mode  Im canceling my reservation,
Waiting on the jeep or truck version,
thats not affordable i can buy a Volkswagen R With massive 300 HP with just extra 5000 _,
Tesla should have given headsup display on the front,
When the touchscreen is broken no AC Why is everything with the touchscreen Also more motors to replace hen they wear out,
310 mile range for the long range No thanks,
I really want to get a Model 3 but Im six foot five and not a slender man I dont fit in a Model S and Im concerned I wont fit in a Model 3,
i drive an oldschool 76 c 10 with a 379 diesel and get more than 35 mpg but i look forward to these inventions,
Marques Brownlee Good video as alwaysBut one small correctionthe Full autonomy option is 3000 morenot for 5000 more  Cheers,
nice looking car but i prefer VEYRON BUGATTI lets start racing hehehe,
The question is can it drift,
I wonder how adding electric motors and touchscreen controls for the aircon vents could possibly be cheaper than just having manual knobsswitches I want to get this car but living in Australia its likely going to be a while and well no doubt have our Australian surcharge stacked onto the purchase price fault of our Government not Tesla,
I still cant call the model 3 affordable Sure its less expensive than the S but considering that autopilot costs 5k self driving costs 3k a color other than black costs 1k actually good looking wheels 15k and good interior 5k the car can get very expensive 35k is already above the average a person spends on a car and if you get a Tesla theres no way youd get it without autopilot,
Yes I plan to get a T 3,
Since Im trying to scale down my car purchases money wise Id start with the base model It sounds like a car I can afford and handle Glad its simple Thanks for the update I would love to test drive it,
I love the vision that Elon Musk to better everyone quality of life Thanks Mr Musk,
If you drive this while its raining will it still work,
So since pretty much everything is done in the touch screen if that screen fizzles and crashes youre basically screwed lol Not a fan of that,
Im looking at this vs the kia stinger still undecided,
Touchscreen to open a fricking glove box,
An affordable car is 510k,
At least it has a headphone jack,
If I want the battery upgrade and the full autopilot functionality will be 45000,
*did you just say rwd hello drift season*,
Everything on a touchscreen is a deal breaker for me,
the hype is real lol i cant wait for full reviews after owning the car for one year ,
I cant wait to buy this in 20 years when I have money,
CUP HOLDERS ,
Marques yo you gotta talk to your boy Elon about this SEC situation Crazy,
Wow Model 3 Amazing,
Producer drum play friend district arena suspicion snake,
A young bro bro in a Tesla Thats wusup Thank you for sharing your video,
ELIO PUSH SCOOTER my price point for new  but hey  extra cupholders  I can go with that,
Oh look Facial recognition *AND* a fingerprint scanner Glares at Apple,
Rainbowing Yes Thats how we all like to use our phones  from the side to catch the rainbow Dont we No And do we care Nah In fact for half the price of an iPhone X the rainbow looks pretty good from here,
Looks like a decent phone Nice alternative for those not interested in either Apple or Samsungs 1000 phones,
1Dont ever CHANGERemove your Dash Charge Headphone Jack Performance Ceramic FP scanner Price,
449 for a snapdragon 835 makes you wonder what kind of margins samsung and the other expensive phones are rocking,
*Im glad oneplus is not ditching the headphone jack*,
Headphone jack Alright Im sold It already sounded pretty good but if Im gonna put my money where my mouth is,
Returned my iPhone X got this 5t So glad I did,
I would buy this phone over any other phone on the market any day,
that face unlock is fast its basically saying dont fall asleep when youre with your girl SHE can unlock it instantly and ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOSE,
I was considering this but as soon as I saw the headphone jack *Instabuy*,
Its a amazing phone And its my favorite phone because it was cheaper than Samsung Note 8 and IPhone X I would say 5t is best,
And the most Ironic part is that Apple X costs just the same ie the price Apple is paying for each phone is around 300400  even less maybe I am using OnePlus 3T and it has never let me down Although I wont be upgrading anytime soon to OnePlus 5 because i am not financially ineptNeedless to say I will be buying a Oneplus 78 Cheerio Apple  you useless overpriced piece of shit who hasnt innovated since Job Died,
it does a weird rainbow effect seriously do you look at your phone like that No I seriously think people are so foolish with money and wasting it on needless junk,
The head phone jack is definitely a win,
not bad considering its cheaper than iPhone back glass panel,
It looks like a great phone not only because of its specs but also because of its price point I believe more Android user should consider buying it In that way we can discourage big companies to go beyond some crazy prices for their flag ships and support companies who are ready to provide good mobile gadgets for a reasonable price I hope 1 will consider investing in a phone in Samsung Note territory Then it will become a must buy to me,
A minute silent for those already bought one plus 5 earlier with the same price,
Who can help me to solve this equation 15tX,
I got the phone The fingerprint scanner is so fast that i had to check twice if it was enabled Amazing,
5 awesome feature of OnePlus5T 1 He 2 Ad 3 Pho 4 Ne 5 jack,
Looks like the lg v30 with a 7 plus back,
Why buy iPhone X when you can buy two 1 5T for you and your love one,
I still dont understand why they wont add OIS,
Hey Marques could do a One plus 5t Vs iPhone 8 Plus Thanks in advance,
_2 min Silence for those who bought one plus 5 recently_,
Watching on my brand new OnePlus 5T xP,
best phone ever made honestly,
You have allmost the same amount of subs Than people in my country,
Hey MKBHD This is the best phone I will buy it  awesome video  But can you tell me the name of the wallpaper so can apply it,
Wallpaper name Painted Town,
Hi marques Can you please provide a full review of 5T,
When you uploading OnePlus 5T review,
OnePlus 5T *500 iPhone X 1000 *totally makes sense*,
The 5T feels like a true followup to the One 3 and 3T It gets a 1 from me,
Brought just yesterday Everything what I expected for nearly perfect phone for me,
Wow that face recognition is super fast I wonder if this can also be fooled by using a mask Great video as always MKBHD ,
Can you compare it with Pixel 2 One Plus 5T or Google Pixel 2 which is better,
Camt decidw between this the pixel 2 or the s8,
RIP My Buddy who bought OnePlus 5 last week,
Watching this on OnePlus 5 A beautiful phone Battery Performance feel and other things make this phone so nice,
oh boy if i had 500 i would get this and drop my iphoneor sell it honestly this phone just looks better is bigger and refreshing compared to iphones also thanks to apples slowing down my iphone id rather get a new one that isnt being slowed down by updates,
Watching this on my OnePlus 5t,
How to get that wallpaper,
I feel bad for the folks who bought the 5 a few months earlier LOL,
you wouldnt like this though it isnt Oled Well yeah because its AMOLED which is better why wouldnt I like better,
OnePlus 5T is my phone of the year  2017,
I saw the price dropped quite a bit so now it is time to buy my 1plus collection notify me for used ones that are in mint condition,
please do a full review on onePlus 5 T,
This phone deserves a lot more attention and praise for its price Well done,
There is no longer Room for The fingerprint redder on The front watching this on a OnePlus 6T,
When will 5T get front cam portrait mode,
waiting for your full review ob oneplus 5t hope you upload it soon,
One plus with nokia pureview technology,
My only problem with the OnePlus 5T is that it doesnt support USB PD like all of my other tech does,
1080p doesnt look bad come on MKBHD 1080p is glorious,
it is the best phone of 2017 but i think oneplus should release another model with ip68,
for people watching this in 2019 and thinking of buying this phone Android Pie Day 1 performance Battery life Im still getting 56 hours SOT Average cam but just download Gcam Apk and it should slightly be better still a great buy,
Rip Iphone x Face thingy,
It just like Vivo V7 plus 90 same,
i frickin love you dude youre most likely the only damn person on this planet who says 21 instead of 189,
My OnePlus 5 went through a washing machine and survived,
hey brother plz do comparison video between oneplus 5t vs sony experia xz premium oreo version  which is better need suggestion,

OnePlus 5T is seriously awesome,
Thank you so much for the Backdrops app I discovered some amazing wallpapers,
Yes and that makes my LG G2 bezels 2017 as well The phone that never get old,
OnePlus5 features an AMOLED screen hence MKBHD is incorrect in his statement,
5t or pixel 2xl i absolutely cannot choose,
Dude Your videos are great to watch and very informative Can you tell me where to get that wallpaper you are using in this video,
*Atleast they didnt went apple by removing the finger print sensor*,
One plus and Motorola have always been the low cost flagship killers owned one of both phones Amazing bang for your buck super fast and fairly cheap,

Will you be doing a full review,
Just bought it everything I wanted and more This phone is AMAZING,
oneplus forever,
Giant killer Smart too for keeping the headphone jack,
Coming from a 3t user and loving it I am sure this 5t rocks,
I love my oneplus 5T its a great phone for its price Especially the fast dash charging,
Wait 6k comments already I thought I was early,
Very interesting thing with a affordable price or flagman We could buy 2 thing or Galaxy note 8,
mkbhd and oneplus 1080 is okay mkbhd and apple OMG 1080 IN 2017 WTFF,
super pixel tech from nokia 808 they call it over sampling or something,
Watching this on my One Plus 5t 333,
got this phone looks good so far,
I dropped my Oneplus 5t in a hot tub for 15 seconds It was fine I dried it off and kept using it Perfectly fine,
LewisUnboxTherapy daily driver is OnePlus 5t,
Shouldnt 5T be the little brother since it came later,
One Plus 6 will probably be released next week The 6T the week after that,
Is it worth buying 5t if I already have oneplus 5,
Watching on one plus 5t,
100 one plus 5t giveaway Like one plus 3t,
Flagship killer,
How is June 2017 until November 2017 just a couple of months old its more than that man,
Plzz do a full review,
I need a phone for my wifewas thinking about this phone  the elephone S8 Which is better for the   why,
I am buying oneplus 5T just because of the audio jack,
anyone tilted their phone,
Liking it it so far Off subject it would be hella sweet if you got the Tesla Roadster BRO,
Wish they had used their logo as a finger print that would be awsome,
daamn the way you made this video and how you talk about the product great work Its very satisfying to watch and you keep it interesting I will definitely keep watching your videos btw I think this was the first video of you that I watched which actually makes me wonder because your content is fya,
Should stick with 169 display,
Hi bro can you tell me the wallpaper name ,
Facial recognition on 3 3T 5 was already available,
The dream smartphone 2017 Video is highly required Marques,
Hey marques which is better the razor or this oneplus 5t stuck between both thankyou,
In your face Apple Literally,
The 5t has a amoled screen wich has idividually lighten up pixels,
Full review of OnePlus 5t,
Is the jelly effect permanently fixed,

Sounds very promising although I will wait for the full review,
Wait you have a lisp How come over never noticed,

J quero um One plus 5T,
Hey mkbhd please make a review on this OP5T I trusts your reviews and i cant wait anymore,
LG V30 REVIEW PLEASE you did say you would,
Marques how to connect multiple Bluetooth device in OP5T,
Thank you for watching Talk to you later Peace Something about that Phrase was weirdly unsatisfying,
Loved When you said  it Resembles its little brother,
can u do a full reveiw on one plus 5t,
499 Well say goodbye to the essential phone,
So a friend takes your phone usually its locked with a code or fingerprint Now they can just point the phone towards your face and they are in,
Apple spent millions of dollars into RD for Face ID where as they could just find a way to put a fingerprint sensor on the back and use a face unlock feature like OnePlus,
Just the Apple logo is worth the extra 400500 In my humble opinion,
Writing this from Oneplus 1 Still charming,
They need to work on their presentation skills That live event was boring af Nonetheless cant wait till I get the phone,
After 3 admirable years with the Galaxy Note 4 i feel i really made a great choice to replace it Loving the OnePlus 5T so far,
The face Id is way more secure then the one plus 5 is,
Turing cadenza vs One Plus 5t,
only downside no SD card slot and Mono speaker apart from that i give the phone 8510,
This is what 5 should have been,
Still waiting the Face recognition review HELLO Marques,
when are you gonna upload the full review,
Now this is value for money,
OnePlus 5t vs Google pixel 2,
name of the wallpaper in backdrop pls,
Oreo just got released yesterday for the 3T so it should also be ready for the 5T,
Bazel less design First phone of one plus,
Apple and one plus be like  Are Ramesh are Suresh sasta suresh,
I thought the title would be *Oneplus 5t Impressions*,
So excited My 5T is on the way and im upgrading from an oneplus one ,
Plz do full review ,
Hey MKBHD Did you get a skincase for this phone I usually go with your recommendations when it comes to skinscases,
The snappy Beast,
Which one is better Note 8 or oneplus 5T,
Yeah yeah Pixels is so smart Note8 has the best screen Oneplus is a budget phoneblah blah blah At the end of the day Android is android and trash is trash,
stop saying its 2017its cringe,
what about review of 5t,
Im waiting for a showdown between this and the V30,
I actually like the rainbowing effect ,
I like it Interested to see a comparison with the LGV30 great video as always,
Hows it sennheiser cx 180 earphone for op5t,
I was expecting them to bump it up to 600 or at least 550 Half the price of the iPhone X and Note 8 Thats actually impressive,
Please make a detail review of OnePlus 5T,
microscopy has been using binning for low light images 2x2 for decades lol,
will op5t buyed in india works with australian networkplz suggest,
Nice video bro,
OnePlus 5T OnePlus 5 Users 55T Price,
Waiting for the full review,
Excellent Review  Thank you,
16 Megabixel That was pretty funny,
Finally watching from OP5T,
one plus 5 is the best smartphone,
iPhone6s,
Onplus is the best D,
Can you make a review on moto x4,
Great I bought the One Plus 5 like last month ,
when u love that background but u have an iPhone,
2019 still using this phone with no prob,
hey marques when will you upload the full review of this phone thanks,
Try this out oneplus owners Go to calculator Type 1   See what happens,
Definately one of the best phones for the price out there,
When watching videos can you pinch to fill screen,
Those who love stock android phones Oneplus 5T is the best Its really fast and have interesting features,
Busted out the Pixel so we could see the speed of the facial recognition time Details like that make Marques reviews the best,
iPhone X killer which literally cost half the price well done one plus ,
This is an amazing phone Convinced my girlfriend to get this from gearbest to move on from her iphone 6s But I got the s9 just because I like it more,
FYI the merging pixel data for the camera in low light is called supersampling The Lumia 1020 used it,
Not every phone is perfect Oneplus are at their best,
Facial recognition There is not a whole information about thisHOBOBO,
seems nice I guess I just wish smartphone makers would make phones fully waterproof like take a swim waterproof,
Watching on OnePlus 5t,
give me that wallpaper plz,
I would seriously want a phone to be fire proof,
Your best video ever,
That facial recognition is insanely fast Not a fan of facial reck but its cool to see another company try to oneup no pun intended Apple,
Got a SD835 and Adreno 540 Flagship for 350 new Thats a flagship killer Its a Xiami Mi6,
Oneplus 5 8gb ram or Oneplus 5t 6gb ram,
I only wish one more thing from Oneplus ie WaterProof ,
Watching on my OnePlus One looks like time to switch,
Im watching it on a OnePlus 5,
I believe this phone is better that the iphone 7 MY OPINION NO HATE its a big and decent and fast phone,
Marques please reply how can I buy it in Jordan ,
Sounds brilliant if I was not an iPhone user this would be my phone for Android,
Hey man Any follow up to the face unlock testing,
Never Settle means never settle financially and buy a new one plus device every 6 months,
Best smartphone budget 2017,
RAzer was a huge letdown for my beastly phone this yr so leaning towards 5T,
thank you for wallpaper app,
I have one and its great Never looked back,
Oh i love this guy Peace,
Work s with freedom mobile Yes,
Such a good and awesome 2017 phone to date for the price point 499  I wont think to get same price here Maybe,
That lava Red one plus 5t comes out tomorrow it looks good check it out sir,
This phone is the best value for the money For real,
when are you doing a full review,
Coloca a legenda em portugus,
HiI would like to know what is your favorite dbrand skin for him Tnx for the video it was great,
really amazing OnePlus 5T  And Interesting video   ,
WoW WoW WoW Great phone Specially design face unlocking feature   display,
If u just want to check notifications on lock screen How do u do it,
Can you connect to hdmi via mhl,
So yes this proves touch ID and face ID can be in a single device Btw marques  u totally rocked as usual,
I thought youd review this phone as you usually do instead of highlighting the features,
I love how OnePlus can pull off such a great flagship killer at THAT PRICE,
Hey what wallpapers are you using ,
Marques try Smartisan jianguo pro2 best designed Android phone in 2017,
LG V30 REVIEW,
Sir plz upload the expected release month design  specifications of Apple IPhone SE 2,
Hey his headphone in backround is moving wire,

Another Beast With a 2017 like Design and with under budget,
Love it From 15T phone,
Hey there i just confused is it having the FACE ID FEATURE while in ur trolling video u didnt shown whether it unlocked by face id or backside sensor,
449 with 10 student discount seems like a steal to me ,
But iphonex still got talking donkeysEMOJI which oneplus5t doesnt havehaaa,
Are you going to do a full review for this phone,
Oneplus 5t seems great I am still using their first phone Still going strong though having backdating features wanna use this beast but ,
u can change the way facial recognition work in settings,
nice price with mega speed good one plus salooot respect,
Can someone please give me a plausible reason why viewing angles matter when ever have you looked at a phone other than from square on Some reviews penalise a phone because of viewing angles but its completely absurd Viewing angles cause absolutely no issue in real day to day usage,
I have a OP 3T and that also has facial recognition Its also insanely fast so im not sure what all the hype is about,
Oneplus 5T vs samsung note 8 speed test and camera comparison please,
Should I wait for one plus 6 or should I just buy one plus 5t,
Whats the name of that wallpaper Im not able to find it in backdrop,
Just wish they rounded the corners of the screen,
As someone who owns the original OnePlus 5 I like the 5T but Im not going to go out of my way to get the 5T  mainly BC I like having an actual home button to some degree,
Should I get the oneplus 5t or mate 10,
OnePlus 5T or S8,
hey man  what is besy for me i like gaming a lot  whta should i choose  one plus 5t or s7edge  does the 1 has any issue,
Still waiting for One plus to take over the market,
Why didnt you do a full review,
Oneplus 5 Or 5t ,
best phone in the market im using the oneplus 5,
Is this phone available on Verizon,
So many tech youtubers Many post about this But the first vid is always yours Cuzz u done it best,
Please make a video on oneplus 5t cases Need to know if default TPU case is good enough or any extra case need to be purchased,
Thanks for ruining the happiness as I didnt observe the rainbow when it is seen from sideI saw it now,
Face recognition works very fast but it costs you a portion of battery life,
Nooo the fingerprint reader,
1 5t  I dont know what does t equal,
MKBHT please let us know if you have any comparison in 5t vs Nokia 8,

Do you already know when the full review will come,
Stereo front facing speakers missing,
I was going to get the Pixel2 XL but every reason I wanted it this phone does better for cheaper woops Sorry google I think your phone just got killed P,
Ive ordered one plus 6t and Im here watching every one plus review ever,
love your videos respect your opinions and thoughts on videos but you should definitely get a better pop filter for your mic please keep up all your videos,
It definitely has a OLED Display,
Almost forgot the OnePlus 5 even existed,

*Im scrolling through the comments because I am scared*,
Likepewdiepie CommentTseries PEWDIEPIE RULESSS Edit Thx for those likes,
Ahhhh the good old times before Tgay,
I learned two things today 1 I learned what trypophobia is 2 I learned that I have trypophobia,
Like PewDiePie Comment TSeries Of course i liked,
I am watching in 2019 and now I remember why 2018 was such a strange year,
Video was legit hard to watch it made me so damn uncomfortable for those of you who are not affected by this great I really wish I wasnt either,
He wasnt kidding when he siad do not watch,
I have trypophobia too And I am officially about to vomit,
This isnt how to cure trypophobia its just giving me a panic attack,
Im not trypophobic I love Spongebob,
You just gave your weakness Now TSeries is gonna hunt you,
_hes not even wearing gloves_ *cant relate more*,
I went through the entire video with you pewds you do not walk alone,
Holes are okay as long it is not a living thing not on a human body part and nothing comes out of these holes XD,
Tryphopobia actually needs to die,
I have this phobia too But curiosity has took the best in me but now Im scared,
I mean u did warn us but * FUK NU *,
Whenever I see small holes I just want to rip through all of them with a knife so they can become one hole,
412 Thats in British Columbia you silly holeburger,
I have trypophobia No wonder why I kept shaking through the entire video _,
I never was so thankful that something was censored,
Ahhhhhh Am I alone who was watching this while eating WARNINGDO NOT TRY IT,
I WAS OKAY UNTIL THE DOG FUR ONE,
I have Trypophobia to dont worry I screamed loud and it echoed in my room then I hit my heat on my bed frame,
249 when your mom call u while playing fortnite,
I dont know but for me this is so satisfying to watch *sorry for the people out there with trypophobia* Edited except the dog part aw I love dogs I feel sad to see him suffer,
I was always afraid of small holes but I never knew it was a phobia,
i dont even have trypophobia but this was disgusting,
Omg we both have the same phobia,
I remember seeing this two years ago and died inside why am I back here suffering myself again,
531 Me in the morning ladies 534 Mom walks in,
See I never listen to the warnings and I always end up regretting it,
If your trypophobic *YOUR AFRAID OF SPONGEBOB*,
I wanna see the too much for YouTube,
I get the chills when I see holes,
I was wearing headphones my poor ears,
I have no trypophobia I just kept on laughing on every reaction of Pewdiepie,
Its not the holes that creep me out its what is inside,
Why does it look like popcorn ,
Im immune to trypophobia Wish Pewds was at the beginning too,
Whats scary about this Lol,
Plz watch this video want to know what your reactionto the ocean is deeper than u think,
*I just got chills all over my body*,
Omg Jag spydde nr jag kollade p hunden,
Command to let him get million subscribe,
PewdiepieI just hate holes what can I say *Sees many holes in a arm maggots coming out* Meyou got karma pewds EditIts at 207,
I waited for 5 days to build up the courage to watch this video,
I didnt know what is was first now i have it Edit An hour after it i was thinking about some of it and i threw up was sick for the restof the week,
Did anyone thought about the pain gone through for the editors while editing this video,
I searched satisfying videosand this came out FUDGEEE,
i know thisbis weird but i literally HATE an Armadillos shell it just HDJSSJSHSJDNSB AAHAHAAHHHH,
This is why we have flame throwers XD,
I know your secret  Felix,
Bruh this is so disturbing,
My talbet dont have mouse 2019,
Watching this video made me realize that I have trypophobia,
I still cant get over this,
I have holes in my bodyThey are called nostrils,
When you have the disease when your scared of little holes WTF,
252 Its a type of maggot that infects animals Its actually good to be afraid of them tbh,
I litterally had to work up actual courage to watch this,
347 alkhab Bomb If your fear is tryphobiea and if its Gray Like to Undo Read more,
It gives me goosebumps,
I hate everything about this Everything Every Good Goddamn Thing My stomach is in my throat My skin is crawling away from my body and I am screaming internally In conclusion NO,
Are you really man,
I think Im more afraid of the stuff coming out of the holes than the actual holes themselves,
I thought it was a fear of trying,
After watching this i think i have developed trypophobia,
pew wore hearts pantsu in this video im sorry my english is bad 322,
Moi aussi jai la trupophobie jai eu des frissons pendant toute la vido jai failli rejet mon dner,
*Trypophobia has entered the chat*,
if i see this again i will slap you with a fish and flush myself 50 times for 3 likes,
dude so loud but your still cool and famous,
I was just sitting here drinking my Pucko and now Im in the bathroom puking,
Im glad I dont have trypophobia,
I dont even have trypophobia and this scared me,
I dont have this phobia,
My friends just faped to this Is he weird ,
Why am I watching this in 2019,

I have no problamo shlamo volcano with this,
Look at how good the editing used to be,
Im so sorry I have the same damn fear,
Looks like macaroni holes,
I dont like to see a lots of hole like that,
Watching this made my whole head itch for some reason,
247 1 like 1 chance to dog saves,
Anjirr mau muntah aku,
I miss the intro so much,
Best intro,
i didnt know i had tyrpiphobia but now i do,
What the heck i didnnt know he cussed,
As I was watching this video my body got hot I got itchy and goosebumpshives appeared on my arms,

I genuinely love your videos like this just uncut and playing the game I think you said before you didnt like putting them out because they arent the quality you want as far as editing and planning you felt like you were just pumping out these videos with no effort But I really do enjoy watching you just play the games as normal its refreshing I think thats what everyone means by the old pewdiepie too Not the screaming and playing things you didnt enjoy to keep people happy but you just playing whatever and however you want At the end of the day people came back to watch your videos because of your true personality I just think these videos show that a lot so its really nice to see you doing them again,

Keith legit just got brother zoned,
Hello class i am your subisitube teacher MrJackson,
To those of you that claim this isnt smosh allow me to explain 1 smosh is a group founded by Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla as time went on they branched off into smosh games smosh cartoons and have also begun working with different people such as Mari Olivia Joven sohinki and wes these are all now members of smosh and thus all content made by them is smosh content 2 for those of you who say in the beginning it was only Ian and Anthony you are far from correct as in countless videos from the Pokemon videos the assassins creed rap to even the first food battle they had extras camera crew and side characters such as Ians mom Stevie and so on and the every blank ever videos are most likely heavily produced and directed by the founders just because the founders arent in EVERY video they make doesnt mean it isnt their content when was the last time you even heard the name Fusajiro Yamauchi for those who dont know Fusajiro Yamauchi is the founder of Nintendo and yet modern games such as smash bros 4 Pokemon x and y and hyrule warriors dont seem to have his face plastered everywhere i guess it isnt his content then i think you see my point,
I wish i had a teacher like mr jackson,

Thats a disaster but remember only one thing dont ever return to all of your exes either if they beg or ask you back dont listen to them explaining about this that etc its only fair they belong in the past so dont pull them back and give them the opportunity to emotionally drain you set your standards right and love your self whats broken will never be revive remember that we are born only once and all of us only have a once and a life time not twice forgiveness is OK to give but its not for second chances,
School electioneer,

TIMMY WHY ARE YOU EATING A CRAYON Dope,
243 I think this is why we just dont do the pledge of allegiance anymore Because the US government created lice and still force us to pledge allegiance Also because Japanese children were forced to say it even while interned in camps far away from their homes that theyll never see again because all their belongings and their homes were sold to banks and wealthy corporate families But hey New Deal Everyones getting jobs,
The way they say Elementary school,
I the same thing happens in my school if you get sick but they beat you up with a stick,

WHAT DO WE GOT people SOUL other guy CREDIT CARD DEBT,
SMOSH may have gotten shut down but I still love watching their videos,
To all the haters of this videobecause all I can see is hate or I want Ian and Anthony back If you are the type of people saying that Ian and Anthony are never there or that Smosh only features Every Blank Ever than you are wrongIan and Anthony still writeproduce and star in every Friday sketch video like they always did if one of them is missing its probably because he is sickThe series Every Blank Ever is the smosh squads serie and always wasIf Ian and Anthony were in it it was because they had helped write the video or they had timeYou guys need to think about Ian and Anthonys personal lifes and that yes smosh is their jobs but they do have other things to worry aboutThey dont live together anymore so things changeIan and Anthony also work on other things like making moviesmaking new shows for us to enjoygoing on interviews to give us information and most importantly they dedicate their lives to usThey have to fly from LA to Sacramentoget together to film smosh is bored and friday videos and other shows when they could be spending time with their families and girlfriendsThe smosh squad are youngermeaning they can take more time off to film a video than Ian and Anthony who may have other things to do in lifeAnd Ian and Anthony still continue to do what they do to make us happy and enjoy their content but when all of you just dont appreciate itit must hurt their feelingseven Ian said that to a fan Hopefully you guys will get the message and truly appreciate what smosh is doingbecause they are only growing and getting more successful Sincerely a true smosher,

I dont know what was more interesting Shane outing the things in the bag Or Shanes story,
You all are complaining about missing Anthony but him and Ian were never in any EBEs Its just the squad So when it comes to this series nothing is going to change,
Sure are a lot of Riley Emersons,
047 I was eating lucky charms,
The credit card part killed me,

Theyre magically okay,
Instead of bitchin about missing Ian and Anthony in smosh vids I do love them Im going to give this video a compliment because I enjoyed it Funny video Every Blank Ever is one of my favorite series from Smosh You guys have to understand that Smosh has changed and if you dont like it you are certainly not obligated to watch it I cant wait to see the replies to this lmao,

415 and 425 how did he switch skin colour,
I got a supermarket ad before this,

Why was the titanic in the back in 1776 at 227,
The politics one killed me,
When in the course of human events it becomes nessacary for a battle to commence,
In America we fry everything including candy Not literally dont take offense to that and dont be rude about it,
Americans if youre going to be in America then speak English Americans *goes to other countries and expect others to speak English*,
I feel weird watching this Im British,
Since civilised debate is the foundation of our great nation Are your sure that Cabinet Battle 1 and Cabinet Battle 2 from Hamilton are fit to be deemed as civilised,
Politics in 1776 why is there the titanic there,
243 LMFAOOO So acCuraTe,

I think some people in the comments need to get something straight 1 definition of racism prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race This means that it doesnt matter what race you are racism against whites is a thing there is not such thing as Reverse Racism 2 All humans are pieces of fucking trash not just whites or other races 3No one fucking cares about you or your family its over,

Whoever wrote the Politics then and now has never seen Hamilton Its basically a giant twitter fight,
310 not enough shotguns Cant be American without a shotgun,

050 is the best,
This just in World peace achieved because nobody showed up,
when anthony said smiley face i laughed out loud,
at 228 you can see the montage machine on the desk surrounded by crap,
Isnt it weird that theyre talking about China about blocking them even if you have no access to those platforms there,
012 the background noise sounds like the notification of a airdrop in h1z1,
Im a teen and if I ruled he world the national anthem would be master of puppets feat Megadeth m,
Wait they are going Tom become adults,
AWWWW is the first time I heard Olivia speakes Chinese 3,
Smosh is my favourite YouTube channel,
what if for the shipping part it would be Ashley X Cole then they could either choose Coshle or Ashole,
As a teenager I can confirm this is 100 true,
Wow they managed to find world peace by just not showing up lol,
the anthem was lit tho,
Im Canadian so No It was Canada Me were Canadian we cant walk into a wall without saying Sorry there bud I didnt see ya there eh,
World peace achieved because no one showed up Fuuuuck yea,
*Breaking News* *World peace achieved because no one showed up*,
I feel like it would be awesome if smosh was a tv show,

Us Canadians would never TP China but I would Tp you,
*myspace *,
Omg I want to hear the whole song the National anthem in Dubstep is the most beautiful thing Ive ever heard it made me cry inside with tears of joy,
If teens ruled the world it would be a Netflix series 1,
Since Im in 2018 what about Tic Toc,
when Shayne said world peace achieved he sounded and looked like detective Cole Phelps badge 1247 LAPD 1947 LA Noire,
Did Smosh just predicted the trade war,
press 3 for prancis,
Yea blame everything on canada,
No one showed up to battle Nic4,
Anthony,
So what youre saying is The world would be a better place,
still better than todays world running,
See this is sponsorship done CORRECTLY,
Nr1 thing to say on my wedding Yeah dude,
That mandarin was way longer than the subtitles whered they get the voice clip,
If teens ruled the world Everywhere is russia,
That first scene is wrongso f***ing wrong No ACTUAL teen would be awake before 830 AT LEAST,
if Ian is still a teen that means he went through puberty *FAST*,
This is the best channel,
World peace achieved because no one showed up Seems legit,
if teens rule the world north Korea lol whats new,
This is a sequel to if adults acted like children,
you mean if MILLENIALS ruled the world,
Definitely 2017 today,
The transition music keeps getting faster lol,
They already do,
No OGs that remember Myspace,
Have they never heard of Instagram before,
OYE HOW DARE U Dont blame it on Canada Weve only ever TPd Russia and Mexico,
Ive been subscribed for 3 years I think,
China Did you TP us America No that was Canada Canada Damn it america *Canada goes to war against America* And so that is how World war 3 occured,
Both of you to assume teens wouldnt just choose a pop song for the national anthem,
I saw you pretending to be Anthony Keith You cant fool me,
IM FROM CANADA AND U BLAME IT ON UD,
Your going away for longer than 10 seconds Your going away for 11seconds,
This was better than the last couple of videos I hope they go back to making them how they did in 20182013,
I love u guys so much been watching for a long time,
Awesome video bro,
As a teen who hates social media obsession I approve 100,
I TOTALLY SHIP MATILDITCH,
Do a part 2,
Im happy to be bilingual and watch this video XD,
Yo I took Mandarin class in elementary school and kind of understood that without the subtitles,
send me the full national teen anthem song,
Did anyone notice the part where Anthony is firing Ian the montage machine is on the desk,
Ok I accidentally clicked the dislike button and it switched from 39k to 4K wow,
1619 Ruling Age,
Did They block you on Discord,
I am a teenager and I find this very offending Because its so true,
I dont mean to brag but sometimes I can balance the light switch between the on and off position,
I love it If teens ruled the worldand Ian is in it,
The shipping one killed me,
that would be the Apocalypse,

030 That picture isnt even their family,
Ha ha great,
Anthony I love your toilet paper flail,
FFFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLL THE BBBBBBBBEEE3EEEEEEEERRRRRRNNNN,
And now we will visit Sarah and James who moved into a spacious cereal bowl,
poporn,
Why does Anthony look better then me as a girl,
Claustrophobic Hell,
313 hes so beautiful,
   Selfie MADAFAKAS ,
Sell stuff you dont need P,
Ians character made me happy,
If it has WiFi and charger spots Suits me,
Oh God that ceiling,
Finally someone made fun of this tiny house fad,
Wait they are the SAME GHOSTS FROM PEOPLE VS GHOSTS,
I miss the old days where Anthony was in Smosh,
I got this deal on groupon a titanium sword and said to me pls kill jack,
This is more entertaining than the actual tiny homes show on TV,
I know its obvious but I gotta ask Does jack have a mental problem,
i bet smosh wont pin this,
I want to see the microwave house no I need to,
oh my actual god I was looking at actual tiny house videos and I stopped scrolling because I was like wtf that looks like Anthony,
Am I the only one who thinks this video is pretty funny  Just this one video tho,
That tp vale,
At the end That was MESSED UP,
This video makes real tiny houses look huge I was getting claustrophobic just looking at it,
smosh make a reaction video and react to its everyday bro plz,
So I did the math and Jack is only about 139 pounds,
Whats the smallest house Dog house,
this is gonna be hard for me to live in this house because im ywo tall,
SMOSH KEEP DOING THIS PLS,
As much as I like the Smosh cast its nice to see an episode with majority or it just being Ian and Anthony,
I can live there because Im 8,
Ian looks so sad when he says *sweet heart no,
Did you guys saw the picture of a baby on 031 Like,
Wheres the spacious microwave house video now,
Somethigg about your girl that makes my head wanna twirlll,
id rather live outside to be honest,
Tiny house are so cute though in real life Im gonna do it,
living in a tiny house would be more expensive how you ask well it would cost more because of its  unusual appearance,
all fanfictions have come true,
235 I think you meant to say FEEL THE BERN,
Groupon Ruins Your Life,
STEVIE WHERE ARE YOU DID YOU TURN INTO WALLEY,
Say voldemort 5 times clap 3 times and dont talk till you repost this,
PLS DO ANOTHER 0,
That must be one Full House,
He will be only 35 lb XD,
They should be on extreme cheapskates,
I like how Shayne barely has to bend down,
They should make this a series called *TC*,
2018 anyone Ive been looking for when they move in the microwave cant find it,
Imagine the neck pain of living in that house,
I think i get it why people say they want just 2 of them like this,
Ive been binge watching old Amish videos for the past week,

Smosh can you do again part two please,
I am eating POPCORN WHILE WATCHING,

I love smosh smoshforlife,
XDDDD IT WAS A VAN ALL ALONG XDDDD,
I want more videos with Jack and Susan ,
This video needs more protein,
They keep changing all the thumbnails,
89k was me,
031 the baby in the picture is probably Robby from the divorce court video,
Still waiting for Roger and Kim Klombottom in the microwave,
this is so true all these new tiny house things are ridiculous,
I need more of this couple lol,
Susan is such a cheapskate,
How about sell some popcorn get more money,
Big things come in small packages,
If we got to be real this isnt funny,

I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL SMOSH,

Smosh gay confirm,
100 thats actually really creepy,
I Could Fit There ,
That dude is gonna be me,
tinyhouse,
The smallest house in uk is in Conwy wales,
i ship jack and susan so much,
Anthony destroyed the popcorns at 310 Do you know what can we do with it  if u didnt destroyed it  We could make necklaces and also eat those popcorns ,
i did know this was a real show,
sill waiting for them to move out in a microwave,
so how did you make the setting,
This kind of reminded me of Sims,
My name is Susan so it is officially famous,
Did anyone notice that Jack and Susan have been in Um 3 videos including this one,
This connects to ghosts vs humans,
I could feel the powder being coughed on my face,
Omg lol 345 shanes scream was Hilarious,
The worlds smallest house would probably be my ants house,
Real smosh without the smosh squad,
U guys pay for rubbish pickup in America thats sad,
Actually MAKE A SERIES ON DIS,
I wish I can get a odd amount of likes,
you know how they said at the end of the video they will make another video tiny house in a microwave which is space list so I hope you Smosh people make the video about in the microwave because I really want to see the microwave on video so even Anthony I hope you make the microwave video because it said at the end of the video of this video is said to come back for a space with microwave so please make the video I want to see it so bad,

Im still waiting for part 2,
All time fav Smosh vid,

So mutch popcorn wasted ,
I live in a 2500sqft In the US,
i wish you would suffer death,
Susan said that jack lost one pound on the treadmill and he is going to get skinnier but did u guys see when jack ate the popcorn,
Dont keep this comment at an even number of likes,
If they cant get out then how did they get in,
I can only imagine what that house must smell like,
Shaynes face when he screams at the end I love that,
Ian husband and Anthony wife Every fanfictions dream,
346 that face whit that blonde girl cant remember name sry,
anthony looks cute in the thumbnail tbh lol,
026 I couldnt stop laughing tbh,
This video encouraged me to make popcorn,
Thats how Jack and Susan became ghosts,
Hayden Brock your right,
Old smosh Ian Anthony New smosh Olivia Keith Noah Ian AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS I DONT WANNA BOTHER WRITING,
if they really need money they could just sell the stuff he bought since he got it at a cheap price,
Remember when smosh was funny,
Click bait Snail shells are the smallest houses ever,
So the small house was a van this WHOLE TIME,
You gay then even though you do see Anthony as a girl when he wears the wig,
FIRE HAHAHA LOL,
I miss 201213 Smosh ,
it felt like a small part of me died when she knocked over all that popcorn XD,
Id lie down there and both my feet and my head would touch the walls,
this video was hilarious,

How bored do you have to be to volunteer for something like this,
Half of my life I grew up in a homeless shelter and when they were talking about the what the sleep on thats practically what you have to sleep on there But you get blankets and pillows ect But also there is a lottttt of fights there and drugs The best i can describe it is its like a jail but a little bit less bad,
the chief is quite clever He is actually the major smuggler and when the federals where onto the prison he knew it was just a matter of time till they do something to uncover Thus he creates a scenario where he exposes and uncovers others to make himself look innocent There u go another hollywood movie pay me my money,
335first they all go to jail bootcamp 416jail vs Afganistn 720i came home a better personI dont judge grateful for life awesome vision for myself and my family I am so open to everyone now Im kind I am not as opinionated as I used to be I am all here,

Welcome to the USA enjoy your mandatory stay at the 60 Days Inn,
expose corruption you really believe that the show is for nothing more than ratings and money If every square inch of jail is covered with videosound surveillance whats the point of undercovers It all happens right in front of the cameras,
i thought in the beginning he said cowanker oh my god its coanchor,
Jail in South Africa is a place I never want to see not even for compensation on a voluntary basis,
I think you guys are confusing Jails with Prison This show is Jail with people waiting to be sentenced or serving their time typically up to one year Usually people in Jail have lesser crimes meanly misdemeanors Prison on the other hand is for people with Felonies murders 10 yrs to Lifers etc The most that you will see in Jail is a fight but usually nothing harsh Besides who would risk doing something crazy when youre serving a year or less,
We really need to rethink our jail prison system,
you know what life is going crazy for people lol good video can you send me your videos thanks,
I think Id request jail in Norway or Sweden,
I think every judge should have to go to jail for at least two weeks before they take their position so they know what its like before they give out these insane sentences,
111 This place is miserable Well its a prisonsooooo,
Lmao okay so put their faces on tv,
my jail experience keep to yourself be cool ride it out make a buddy or 2,

did he just say cowanker at the beginning,
Give me 100 million dollars I would volunteer for 90 days,
I agree with the female I know i defiantly got humbled after doing my time I used to think jail was a picnic and taxpayers are paying for it It really is not Yeah you get a TV but they dont tell you that its only one it hardly works and you can only watch it when your race dose There is just alot of things you see differently after doing time Still better not to break the law in the first place haha,
So they are both military which means they are both easily controlled They should do fine,
The guy that wants do be a DEA agent Its a good job,
David Hogg should volunteer bubba and the boys would pass him around like hands on a clock,
Zac I feel like this will give me a perspective that no other law enforcement officer has translation they all know who i am im dead soon,
Most toughest prison system i guess REPLY,
One of the volunteers getting punched in the face made me low key mad cause fighting back would blow his cover,

Now do 60 days at ADX Florence,
medication time is a threat to my i you are delugeing the problem with the war on drugs i wish jihad upon the prison system its satanic bloodlust with a purpose,
If I went to jail Id be abused endlessly,
This is real and the officers promote this They orchestrate killings of inmates I went to prison and I saw this with my own eyes,
He said night time wanker instead of worker,
You need to go to jail to realize thats miserable,
You cant take Barbra any where,

I think a government officials should spend 60 days in jail as a requirement for the job,
538 to drive between her eye brows would cost 750 in an uber,
That is a good question I have asked myself too if jail is so bad why do they keep going there and doing the something that will put them there and more years  Thats crazy show how much they love there self and there family,
420 thats ironic,
I really do not mind prisoners killing one another Really It saves a lot of tax dollars I think we should get all the inmates in any given institution a few hundred baseball bats and let them have it out in the yard Problem solved,
How are you going to find the real truth about prisons if you go in there with a reality TV show and huge cameras Not to mention all the editing Not seeing the true prison system just what the producers want you to see,
Here in Sweden you get free education and you get to play xbox in prison lmao,
Her neck is longer than my drug test results,
Okay but when you know youre getting out in 2 months thats just a vacation,
Man prison isnt pleasant this must change,
this is jail not prison not as bad,

Am I the only one who find that apartment nothing special for its price,
Im too poor to look at this,
Take the 20M travel the world 1st class for 10 years and come back truly inspired instead of living in a well decorated closet with a view,
and i cant even replace my phone charger,
It is not worth 20 million,
Well i live in India and with all that money i could buy the whole goverment,
as cool as the apartment is doesnt seem like it has a home feeling,
Move to Texas for that kind of money you can get a house twice the size 1000000 acres and all the steaks you can eat,
Can get a mansion worth that price,
The tallest fire engine ladder in the world goes to 13 stories thats just my two cents,

OVERRATED,
1 Pay 20 millon 2 Do the dishes,
What view concrete concrete and more concrete as far as the eye can eye How depressing knowing whats happening below And someone would actually waste money on it Ffs,
I just need a place to be clean sleep and make food like ramenand computer work,
I would probably close all the windows and spend the day on the phone,
Even if I was the richest person on earth Id still probably not buy that apartment With 20 million you could build a complex with all the amenities you ever dreamed of  completely custom to your own tastes and still have enough left over to pay all the staff to maintain it for a couple of decades Sure if you work in NYC it makes sense to buy an apartment there but you can probably get a very nice one for a tenth of that price and use the remaining 18 million to build the mansion of your dreams outside the city,
with 20 million I would NOT be living in New York,
I like Trumps penthouse better You walk into this apartment into a hallway No foyer for that price Views were great but I dont know if I would want to bathe in front of all that glass Too many telescopes around these days,
Not worth,
Man that crib is not worth it And it looks very plain and boring And also gay,
Eh too cheap for me,

New Amsterdam I mean New York is going to be the first place they do away with,
Shabbat Shalom and Greetings From The San Francisco Bay Area Richmond California,

He should have thrown someone out of a window after his a view to literally die for line,
I can never live there Im afraid of tall buildings What if there is an emergency You cant survive Also there is no privacy Everything is in clear view The bathroom bedroom You can fall from that window BECASUE it has no protection Like normal windows have I dont know why someone will pay 20 million to live there I will live in a small and nice apartment with smaller windows and more privacy On the 2nd floor Or they can cover the windows with blinds or curtains But how can you get out what if something happens The building is too tall Not a good idea,
20 mil talk about paying for location,
meanwhile what about our homeless problem ,
living in this apartment is great feeling for the first 6 months  then it will be just like any other living places,
If the elevator broke imagine having to walk up and down fifty flights of stairs,
You could not pay me to live in that city Ill take my own home and land with privacy fence a few miles from the beach with a good surf spot Wait I already have that,
Can get a way better mansion for that price with land,
lol Kendis is PUMPED,
I would buy 40 acres and build a mansion,
Talk about living in your ivory tower Looks lonely up there though honestly,
Should of had the real wanye brady do this ,
The whole thing is Gay including the realtor,
After a month youd hardly notice the views and then realise how small the rooms are big mistake brother lol,
Erm how can you have 45 bathrooms XD Do you just cut everything in a half XD,

I will never live up there is too riskyWhat happened if there is an earthquake,
That real estate guy looks like Amy Schumer,
Halfway through and they havent shown the apartment,
I thought apartments were paid in rent per month and condos were luxurious apartments that you could purchase to own waitthis isnt a 20 million dollar a month deal is it LOL,
wow only 3 million years worth of work for a t shirt maker in Bangladesh what a wonderful world we live in,
Do I even have 20 dollars in my pocket let me check,
The study is where u get sniped noscope 360 oooh,

Whats up everybody and welcome to MTV Cribs,
Too much it doesnt really worth it,
I hope i can afford this ,
Holy shit Im losing my mind right now this is actually an apartment oh my goodnessIm coming save it,
Kitchen is bigger than my entire home,
Should be 200k based on how it looks,
why is it only 20 million,
The Owner of that property could Donate 10 Million dollars towards building Property for those that lost their homes in the California fires  are not lucky enough to have Money to rebuild Nobody needs an Apartment that Fancy Too much money dont know what to do with it ,
anyone else sick of wealthy people and looking forward to a revolution,
To me it is worth like 100 grand,
The views are spectacular but Im not into the style of the apartment You walk through the door or come out of the lift and the first thing you see is a wall Plus The onsuite looks like a joke squeezed on the side of the bedroom Its still a decent price and very beautiful though Im sure it sold,
You can buy a house,
Worth 100k tops,
No blinds on the window in the bathroom Someone with a telescope might get the wrong full moon one day,
Even though nobody can see you in the bathId still feel exposed,
Just asking If you had 20 Million Would you spend it on a house or apartment,
I never understood why millionaires stay in cities and dont move to tropical paradises and live like kings of the sea,
Rent must be dew every 20 years,
Your paying 20 million for the view and location apartment is not worth that at all RIP off,
but can you open a window,
This apartment totally was worth 20 million dollars thats why I bought it check the public records,
20 million dollar apartment it has 4 bathrooms *sorry i meant 4 and a half* 117,
Nice location The interior however yikes,
LOL This is so laughable here in Canada The same apartment like this with a fullfloor and even a BETTER view with beaches oceans mountains sunset etc etc will cost you around 1000000 Also the fullfloor apartments would be bigger too But if you really wanted to you can get a mansion starting at 5000000 which is what I would go for,
Multiple dishwashers  lol wtf,
Rats included,
I would feel alone in such big apartment lol,
For 20 mil why is the master bedroom so small,
No Im happy on the ground,
4 and a half bathrooms117,
Its beautiful but price i think its too much,
I do have agoraphobia and I need to hug my dog in the closet I mean great view,
lol you people arent even considering the magical sexy view in the night time ,
why is my house featured on ABC,
Wont be the first time the dude had 7 dudes in the shower,
Kinda want them to do more videos togetherdynamicduo,
U can get mansions for less than that lol,
The jokes on whoever buys this crap because theyre not getting any actual land just a piece of a concrete slab Id rather own land any day A fool and their money are soon parted,
Thats was not so impressive tbh  definitly not worth 20m ,
I would rather buy an island in south east asia for 3 million with full staff included,
Better to buy a yatch I Dont pay 20 million to live in newyork,
206 Trust me,
Is that Perez Hilton,
Some rich people just dont know how to truly invest in themselves Its all about show,
The artwork was horribleit looked as if a blob hit it in grey,
1 million maximium,
with 20 milliion you could buy minimum 10 cool looking houses,
If you mute this and watch the footage this kid could be talking about winning the lottery,
smile during interview not interested in knowing what happened when he was little on phone call fingerprints on pinapple bowl knew how she died before autopsy results were in This guy mad sus,
DO A LIE DETECTOR TEST OMG,
He looks like a crazy boy with that smilelike a psychopath,
exactly my question why is he smiling,
can we at least agree that child beauty pageants are creepy as hell to start with,
Watch the interview when Burke was a child he is asked how he thinks she died He says maybe with a hammer and he swings his arm like hes hitting someone on the head Interesting Because this was before the autopsy results that confirmed she did indeed suffer blunt force trauma to the skull from an object Also I think Dr Phil should have confronted him on Patsys 911 call it was clear 2 other people were speaking in the background one a child and another adult male The whole I dunno nothin approach is pretty unbelievable His fingerprints were on the bowl of pineapple She ate the pineapple right before her death Screaming was heard from the house around 1am All the background voices on the 911 call Someone in that house knew something,
If Burke did it I just hope one day he confessed what he did Poor girl she deserves peace and rest Its been a long time,
Burke just CAN NOT look Dr Phil in the eyes as he said he did not kill his sister I saw all the police interviews when he was a child and he 100 killed her and his parents cover it up,
Hes smiling as if hes replaying sexually abusing his sister and killing her with the hammer he mentioned as a child,
Why is this guy smiling the whole time That kinda freaks me out,
I would wager my life Burke did it The parents were able to go on tv and honestly deny killing her because they didnt Also if one of the parents killed her they would not be covering for and supporting eachother The 911 call is the nail in the coffin You can hear Patsy asking someone what theyve done and the son responding something about getting arrested People need to understand the parents did whatever they could to not lose their only remaining child Most people would of done something similar If you compare Patsys hand writing sample to the ransom note you see its a 999 percent chance she wrote it If thats true she was covering for someone and that someone wouldnt be her husband She wouldnt protect that man after he murders her daughter The son however is a different story,
I really truly believe that they all the three of them know exactly what happened to jonbenet,
he murdered her  burke said he thought someone bashed her over the head BEFORE autopsy results came in he literally mimicked the way he murdered her  burke taking 5 minutes to identify pineapple in crime scene during interview acting very nervous and suspicious  his and his moms fingerprints on pineapple bowl  mom lied she didnt feed them pineapple  pineapple in bowl found at crime scene  pineapple found inside jon benet plus theres more evidence other than the pineapple but that was the big one for me,
No justice for JonBenet Ramsey thanks to the incompetent police and parents,
This whole family is dark,
Burke has anger issues He used to hit her sister a lot watch Jim clementes documentary,
I think the brother he probably never got any attention,
I mean come on even doctor Phil was a little weirded out look at his reaction in the beginning,
Detectives found a partial draft of the ransom note in the home and the legal pad on which the final ransom had been written on three of seven pages torn from the center of the padAnd although it may seem too obvious even to point out realize that unlike in the JonBenet Ramsey murder  a kidnapper doesnt write the ransom note in the house  a kidnapper doesnt write that herespectshis victims business  a kidnapper doesnt molest the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt kill the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt hang out writingand rewriting after the victim is dead  a kidnapper doesnt leave the victim behind in the house  a kidnapper doesnt forget to call to arrange to get the ransom money  a kidnapper doesnt break in on Christmas risking family stay overs  a kidnapper doesnt put oversized underwear found in the house on the victim  a kidnapper doesnt bring someone to the crime 3rd persons DNAon a stain and  a kidnapper certainly doesnt do ALL of the above A predator likewisedoesnt break in to molest a child inside her home and he sure doesnt stop to write a ransom note And if it helps to think through these observations replace the word kidnapper above with intruder,
that smile just screams mentally unstable,
she was so beautiful,
All I know is a mother and son have a very sick love I grew up the youngest of 4 children and the only girl My mother and her sons  my brothers had a very sick love where they could do no wrong I was abused physically on a regular basis by those brothers One broke my nose one gave me a concussion and one I spent the night in jail for trying to defend myself Then my mother picked me up from jail and made me go to school with no clean clothes no teeth brushing no hair brushed and no books I needed I was a freshman in high school Im 62 now my mother and father are dead I have absolutely no relationship with brothers and I do not wish them well,
What in the hell is so funny wow this guy is a creep,
Its funny they say the case will never be solved but Im sure it already has Im not sure which theory but one of them has to be right And most of the evidence points to the family Plus theyre wealthy so theres a good chance theyre covering it up,
The way he speaks about seeing his dead sister in her casketreally unsettling,
The girl is so beautiful They said this crime was unsolved but actually I think it already solved All the evidence are point to the family and especially the brother because his grandmother said before that there was one time when the brother get angry at jonbrnet he hit her with golf club so its possible that he is the one who kill Jobrnet by accident,
smiling an awful lot maybe its his nature or this is a hard topic but even when someone is nervous or hiding emotions this smile is scary,
Kill her in the house and nobody hear nothing  I always believe was the brother  And parents protect him,
Did you kill Jonhenet dadno momno did your son Ummmmm,
what intruder kills a child practices  writes a 2 12 page ransom letter from paper  pen he retrieves in the house of his victim then leaves the body in the basement It just does not make any sense never have  never will common sense says Patsey went to her grave with that cover up Her eternity is now between her  her maker,
The dad Hes a fake and a creep He may say words but it doesnt look like he means them,
If they been a black family or other minority like hispanic the case would have been solved by now and the family behind bars just like Madeleine McCann family,
My grandfather was 46 when Jon died He is still alive and is 60 and does believe the family is guilty,
One creepy conspiracy fact young Katy Perry looks like Jon Benet and her parents look like Jon Benets parents doppelgangers ,
700 thats just wrong Disgusting,
Burke is a psychopath Look at him smiling I believe he killed her by hitting her with a large flashlight on the head Parents covered for him There was no sexual abuse She had a cracked skull,
I wish Sherlock Holmes was real,
How did the dad know to go to the basement first wtf,
poor little girl didnt deserve to die,
Bro did u see the vid before this he basically explained how his sister was murdered he even said someone probably took her real quiet WTH,
Burke did itwithout questionThe same old storyJEALOUSY,
At 647 on this video Check out the broken window it would have been impossible for anyone to have crawled through that shattered glass opening,
Hes all smiles talking about the tragic murder of his sister theres a disconnect somewhere,
The smile is creepy asf,
Hes very quite and privet you mean anti social,
O its solved they did it common sense too much evidence idc I knew from the beginning and im not a detective this is straight bulshit poor Babygirl,
Poor girl still no justice,
I personally think it was his brothers doing and the parents cover it up,
He creeps me out,
*During the interview he was smiling like a freak*,
Dude hes smiling so big talking about a dead body,
Idk if anyone is gonna see this but this dude was innocent It was a 53 year old dude he confessed and got 20 yrs,
I would still be crying going crazy they just act like o I would do this and that bulshit they did it PERIOD,
They should do a lie detector test,
I saw his interview when he was a kid The theories might be right that he killed his sister,
Why is he smiling Is something wrong with him,
i dont think the brother did it I believe the dad did it and the mother wrote the note with the information from john in order to cover his tracks,
someone knows something am i think its so sad what they did,
beauty pageants for children should be banned sickening,
I think his ass did it and the father went and got her to cover the son I think the brother was jealous because she got all the attention But was question is who tf sexually assault her,
Who done it 907 really,
Burke reminds me of Elijah Wood in Sin City,
Unsolved murder 20 yrs now BS we have the technology to solve this but no one is coming forth to do it so it remains unsolved,
I think that guy is the killer of his own sister,
I pray the lord reveals this one day,
I think the brother did it That satanic smile just look at his eyes,
What dad would say Jonbenet is a phedophile s dream come true OMG,
The fact hes smilinng throughout the whole thing really freaks me out,
How is it he is smiling when talking about it Very strange I have wondered if he killed her and the entire coverup by his father and mother was to protect him,
I believe that evidence could point to Burke killing his sister out of rage and so his parents covered this up to protect their last remaining child him I watched a documentary on the case This is just what I think and I could be wrong,
What the HELLLLLL is he smiling  grimacing about I have now officially lost ALL RESPECT AND ADMIRATION for Phil,
no one finds it fishy that the parents were extremely wealthy and owned a mansionbut had no security cameras,
Burk is liyng becuse i know burk hit her in the Head with a flashlight,
THESE PEOPLE ARE STUPID IF THEY BLAMED THE FAMILY THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE COMPARED THE RANSOM LETTER TO ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS HANDWRITINGYOU COULD HAVE DONE 20 years ago,
Wow Burke guilty guilty guilty written all over your face ,
How come they called 911 said that she was kidnapped and gone and later that day she was found in basement like did someone took her killed her and put back in house through that window or PARENTS DIDNT SEARCH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE TO FIND HER They were playing in that basement and they didnt remember to look if she is maybe there and no one think that is suspicious,
Burke Ramseys smile reminds me of Norman Bates at the end of Psycho,
Look around the house shit the police somebody was paid good money this makes me sick common sense come on now im furious,
It was him I believe why is he smiling hes acting veryyyy strange,
Theres a lot about this case that is not discussed for some reasonstrange connections in the familiesevidence that has been deleted missing pages from reports etclot of rabbit holes,
She wasnt abused IDK why media keep repeating that without solid evidence when 5 of the best forensic in the word concluded that she wasnt sexually abused its well explained in the docu series,
*Posso esta enganadamas pode ser elee ele conseguiupq os pais sempre foram apontadose nunca eleo famoso mimadinho com problemas mentaisque so ve filmes de violncia e os resolve reproduzir na vida realisso novo nos EUA*,
Her brother is murdered Hesmiled and didnt sadThis guy isnt a human anymore,
Hes smiling because hes nervous I do the exact same thing when Im nervous or I laugh its just nerves,
This guy killed his sister and the parents covered it up,
Burke should not have done that interview,
Why is he smiling,
His correct place in Asylum,
I have an awkward smile  it always comes out at the worst time,
Why he kept on smiling  That dude looks super guilty or he may have know something He looks like a psychopath enjoying his interview He showed no remorse,
pretty obvious the brother killed her and the parents covered it up with the goofy kidnapping story,
This guy has a definite creep factor,
and it will never be solved uhhhhhh gee thanks Im so glad JonBenet can rest easy with this type of attitude,
Hes smiling while talking about the murder of his sister,
I Suspect Their Family As the Killer Of that Little Girl ,
my theory the brother killed her by accident and the family covered it up for no trouble,
Hes so creepyI thing he killed her I guess,
The reason you never get this interview or get this information soon is because there had to be a cover up in order to hide evidence but in order for that to fade away you have to wait a long time like 20 years later xD,
I WAAAAAANT THEM TO DO A LIE DETECTOR TEST AND I WANNA SEE,
It is a GARROTE Pronunciation rt,
There is something creepy in that family,
Never be solved because the family doesnt want it to be solved Your son has a very troubled mind,
Psychopath  That girl was so beautiful and she was alive she would have been so beautiful  Shes definitely in heaven and these lot will go hell,
When I look at him I remember about a sociopath mom who killed her older daughter and attempted to kill two more She was like that smiling and have no remorse,
i honestly dont think burke did it i think he knows who did it but it isnt him i believe patsy murdered her daughter and john helped cover it up burke might of seen it or the parents told him what happened and was told that he may not tell anyone,
the parents never mentioned their son and his innocence they always said THEY didnt do it,
BURKE RAMSEY GOT AWAY WITH MURDER  PROFIT SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THE EXPENSE OF JONBENET I HOPE HE GOES TO HELL,
So Burke is a software engineer How can he be unstable Yet smile throughout the whole interview speaking of his dead sister Macabre,
That whole family is involved in a b7nch of cult stuff Dad had a book about how to mind control with a stun gun and she had stun gun marks on her back Do the math,
My point of view The father is a psychopath There is no sign of sadness at all when mentioning the daughters death He manipulated the daughter to gain fame and fortune of money He created all facts to cover up the truth of story He killed the daughter for some reasons maybe the daughter knew sth he did not want her to know He manipulated the brother to lie where the brother was uncomfortable  anxious in the interviews through threats and abuse The brother does not seem to be having traits of psychopath he was not as calm and controlled like psychopath While the mother finally realise the reality she was stuck with a psychopath and lost her beautiful daughter she had serious psychological issues and died from cancer years after the incident,
When dr phill asked did you hit her on the head with a flashlight he said no but he didnt look dr phill in the eyes,
That smile omg,
Burke was 9 During the interview he was suffering from anxiety was nervouse and uncomfortableDNA was NOT his,
Why tf is he smiling when he should be sad Plus that smile looks creepy,
Burke Ramseypyschopath if this dude hasnt murder a hooker or 2 lock me up,
Why is the brother smiling so much,
Everything that airs on either Oprah or DrPhil should be heavily scrutinizedthey keep saying  theory while a team of experts concluded based on evidence,
How is he smiling,
this man looks awful,
WTF Why John bennet brother smile Always always and always smile,
this is creepy,
His smiling is creepy  devil,
WAIT WAIT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT DIDNT THEY HAVE CAMERAS THAT HOUSE THAT BIG WITH NO CAMS WITH REPORTS BURGLARY LIKE COMEON,
Why not check the hand writing of the parents,
why is he smiling he looks nuts,
Something oddwrong about his stareeyes  Reminds me of sociopaths,
if im the victims fatheri would already find the killer on my own,
I still think that the brother did it by accident and as every parent would of done they decided to cover it uplesser of two evilsthey already lost one child they wont Sacrifice the other maybe even of their own doing favoring one over the otherwho knows all I know is this is very sad,
Why is the brother smiling so much wtf its weird The brother looks guilty af Anyone else think Children of the corn when you first see this ,
The family is definitely guilty of something,
Its OBVIOUS HE IS THE KILLER That said I am glad he DIDNT get caught Nor is in prison the parents lost one child it would have been unnecessary to punish them more by taking him away from them too He was very young  sick He needed help and clearly he got it and he didnt kill again,
I dont know man I think the family has to have done this,
I wonder what dr Phills real thought of him were,
To be fair to the brother he could be smiling due to nerves about being interviewed or it could even be a grimace I do however agree that the parents did cover for the killer,
We all know he did it,
Burke said on Dr Phil he snuck downstairs after everyone went to sleep to play with a toy This would have been around the time of JonBenets death,
Can people stop saying the brother did it I dont see anything suspicious about him They have DNA showing that it wasnt him and nothing linking him to her death Apart from the fact that he was in the house at the time And the way he is acting in the interview isnt weird you can tell he is very uncomfortable and anxious and thats why hes making that facial expression,
Boy did it He isnt natural He is trying to act like he doesnt know whats going on I feel horrid for the family The boy might have got angry and did some thing he wouldnt regret This case is horrifying,
Theres kinda likesomething off about the mother and the son,
Strange he smile during Dr Phil interview,
He did it and his parents covered it up to protect the child they had left watching interviews of him as a child and even this one he shows a complete lack of emotion towards his sisters death with no real interest in what happened to her,
if the note said dont say anything the only person to know if the parents said anything is burke because he was always in the house near them,
is he was black or spanish they woulda killed him already  sad but true,
118000 is a weird amount of money to ask for,
burke gives me bad vibes,
Extremely strange family Lou smit was bought in my opinion also the head of the DA,
I just hope whoever killed her comes out so she can rest in peace,
Why does he smile so much,
Burke is creepy AF,
Burke Ramsey murdered JonBenet Ramsey and the parents covered it up in my opinion,
839 laughing vanish,
Biggest cover up Ive ever seen John killed her and he wasnt alone,
JonBenets brother Burke looks silent crazy something is wrong with him ,
Then my dad told me she is dead you know *smiling widely* Yup totally normal,
Burke killed her Parents protected him,
Did you see his smug smile like what the heak EDIT OK my heart is to careing to blame the brother because I have a brother and I just cant,
Can we get someone who reads body language to analyze this dr phil ep,
Can someone in that house please just confess alreadyat least for Jonbenetsake,
I feel bad for JonBenet She had a beautiful future ahead of her,
WELL ALL I SEE IS SMILES AND SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED AND GOT AWAY WITH IT,
The brother talked for 1 minute in this interview ,
Why was the last statement so positive when he said  and it will never be solved,
But she doesnt say the brother did it,
He is not smiling he looks unstable insane and Psycho,
Why smile brother poor baby,
This guy is guiltyhe always had a smirk on his face,
He was out of sight for many years The thing I dont understand is how he made it through college at Purdue for four years graduated with a degree and it all went so smoothly He hashad no life otherwise and no social skills,
The smile is like covering up something,
Why is he smiling the entire time His demeanor comes off so offputting,
its true that in every lie theres a bit of truth,
I feel like Burke did it out of jealousy Jealously is the one thing that can start war between siblings,
Why the hell is he smiling,
I do believe that the family is guilty for the murder of JonBenett,
Is it creepy that the brother is smiling like that Creepy,
I think Burke did it most likely accidentally I think Burke is austic but who knows the only one that knows the truth is jonbent rip sweet baby,
We saw this months ago Get some new stuff,
CONFESS CONFESS South Park reference,
what a eerily smiling freak,
He was smiling throughout the interview,
That creepy nervous Smile  I Believe he did it and the parents covered it,
COMINSENCE TRUTH DECTECTOR,
There is something definitely wrong with him,
132 did you hit her with a flashlight absolutely not *LOOKS DOWN* thats a sign of LYING in body language 100 sure this creepy f*** killed her look at his eyes hes psychotic,
if someone claimed that i murdered my own child even though i didnt i wouldnt have stayed so calm i would get really mad,
Narcissist and Psychopaths everything they are saying is classic and suspicious,
In a recent video he did state that the killer stabbed her and said whoops so the theory that she was accidentally killed by her brother makes sense,
Very simple mother didnt want to lose both kids so she covered for him,
Poor baby deserves justice,
Bro why are you smiling,
The brother reminds me of ramsay bolton from game of thrones,
Its a cultreal deal cult that killed herbrother has been initiated as well,
Whywhy is he smiling while describing her casketthis seems so wrong,
Nope He WAS TOO SMILING,
Creepy biggest evidence that a family member did it is the fact that the mother wrote the letter A mother would only do that to protect her child At first I thought it was dad but after this interview he looks vacant,
Why can he not stop smiling,
Id love to crush this guys skull w a baseball bat,
I have the feeling little JonBenet was the only mentally sane person in that family,
He was smiling the whole time talking about his deceased sister,
The note was 3 pages long it was written on a notepad and pen the belonged to the Ramseys it took an estimated 2025 minutes to write the note that right there says someone in the family did it,
Nobody brings up that poor girl was sexually abused over time,
Why is he smiling,
their money kept this case cold,
He is a psyco thats for surelook at his colld chilling smile,
**EVERYTHING** points to the father ,
Most of the time when someone is lying they get really defensive when someone accuses them,
Everytime I would see pageant I would think it said pregnant,
psycho Stop smiling,
Que crueles pueden llegar a ser algunos seres humanos sacando conclusiones tan deliberadas,
I dont think hes smiling because he did it hes probably so traumatized from what happened and is using that personality to cover up and protect how he really is inside and how he feels,
Why does he keep smiling about his sisters death Its weird,
This is police corruption and the family did it one of them knows something,
why doesnt he stop smilingwtf,
He so did it The brother that it Watching the footage of him speaking as a kid when interviewed he clearly shows signs of narcissist boarder line personality and also is say sociopath,
I think her brother is just traumatized I mean he thought he killed his own sister and then he had to see how his parents killed her sister straggled thats because he is smiling Otherwise I cant explain it,
He broke no silence only continued the stone faced charade,
If there was a dog or a cat in the house they also have been suspected,
The brother killed the sister with a flashlight on purpose but he didnt know that it will instantly kill herThe family put up a fake act to avoid shame upon their name and the community,
Whats with the creepy smile through the entire interview,
I believe the brother has been abused and over sheltered Seems a bit simple minded,
Why is this smiling I dont understand why he is smiling talking about his sisters murder,
I think he did it and the parents did a coverup on it As for the unknown dna i call bullshit that lack of info alone got them away with it all,
They would have lost 2 kids if they turned him in,
Why must he smile like this Knowing he got away for murder,
Does anyone else find it creepy that he never stops smiling while discussing the death of his sister Just sayin,
Unless someone talks we will never know for sure,
Think about it if someone came inside from outside they would have taken her out that house Also there was no foot prints in the snow outside that belong to anyone before police got there,
I would wager that Burke killed his sister and the parents stayed up all night figuring out how to stage a fake breakinransom note to cover their sons tracks All the evidence points to this,
HE WAS LITERALLY SMILING THE WHOLE TIME What the heck is he talking about uncomfortable yea ok,
The Phase of Knowingya right,
My question is why is he smiling and why does he look like hes gonna laugh and why does he look so HAPPY I swear this boy is creepy like even the the other interviewer was like why is this man smiling Im like YES WHY This girl was only six so sad RIP angel,
And they treated it like a game They would boast about them thinking they won against the court,
Dr Phil looks stoned,
Brother killed her and family tried to cover it up and protect their murderer son Guilty guilty,
The mother did it She is the boss you can tell An evil boss,
OBVIOUSLY theyre guilty,
Hes a creep,
He smeared on her bed and even on her candy Something very wrong with this person,
there is something up with the brothernot sure what his involvement was but he knows more than he admitsI do not believe this case will ever be solved,
Has anyone dared to give the brother a polygraph Let me guessNo,
It gavemea headache when they said her skull was fractured,
okay in the time youre stressing about disappearing of your own child the stress and youre nervous you decide to go to the basement WTF why didnt he go there before police had come their daughter was disappeared and they didnt come to see if shes in the basement he knew she was there,
People always judge when their on TV being interviewed Hes not an actor so maybe thats his defense mechanism His face looks like a permanent smile,
i think burke killed her and the parents are covering for him,
I dont believe he did it The parents were involved in some deep satanic shit and this was probably a ritualsacrifice Sounds like both the kids were abused and MK ultra was practiced,
Who did it,
Idk if he was involved in the murder or not but he sure looks like he did Creepy af,
Time to research the DNA,
The investigators never brought up on how the murder could of escaped like through the basement window through the attic through the back door other windowsIt doesnt make any sense to me on why ppl would blame the parents for killing their own loved one and the brother is just very nervous and uncomfortable so thats how i know he didnt do it Theres only one thing the People missed and thats the escape i mean you never know,
Why the hell is this guy smiling He seems a bit off,
The smile is misleading Its a typical reaction to such a traumatic event psychologically speaking,
A psychosocio path father and brother and a narcissist mother,
I agree with the police force who tried to get them charged No question mama killed her and dad was a pedophile White best friend of dads was the first to be called on the phonenot the cops Right there guilty They set up the crime scene just like Dr Henry Lee said initially,
And this had to be posted on my birthday,
Those who have ready big shovels need to go digging in the Ramsey and Pastys family backgrounds to find links within the community Both John and Pasty were sexually abused as children themselves This is where the thread of truth can be picked up and followed Pure conjecture Tho its all like writing on the wall to me,
He killed herHe is cain,
He looks just like Patsy RIP to Patsy and JonBenet,
Why is he smiling so much Its like this  she is dead like bro this is a sad moment,
I dont see a smile wth hes a tool,
After seeing this program I have no doubt Burke either did it or knows who did,
It was John Andrew Ramseynot the momdad or Burke,
I havd been so interested in this case N d only way I can conclude is dat Burke hit his sister with d flashlight and his parents staged the entire thing to cover up his crime From d start till the last of you see every evidence it just points towards the family,
That dupers grin tells me a lot about the brother,
The ransom note was long long long winded Definitely it was a pedophile who did this brutal murder So why would the parents write a long note REMEMBER movie Baby Jane Its a movie about sibling rivalry,
Trace or touch DNA can be found on brand new clothes from the people who make or ship it It is erroneous to clear or charge anyone based on it JonBenet ate pineapples the night she died it was found in her small intestine There was a bowl of pineapples with Patsy and Burkes finger prints on it at the scene but not JonBenets Burke was clearly eating pineapples that night which contradicts their testimony that he was in his bedroom the whole night There also was a large flashlight in the kitchen that if used as a weapon is consistent with the head trauma she suffered The marks on her neck are consistent with being poked by Burkes model train set tracks perhaps to try to wake her up Burke had anger issues he had hit JonBenet previously with a golf club in the face He also pooped in her bed and on her Christmas presents that night When a psychologist interviews Burke and shows him a photo of the bowl of pineapples Burke gets very fidgety and cannot identify what it is he acts as though he does not know what a bowl of pineapple is even though in the same interview he earlier said pineapples was one of his favorite fruits So we know JonBenet ate one of his pineapples likely grabbing it out of the bowl and that he had hit her before How would a kid with anger issues react to his little sister stealing his favorite fruit It appears Burke accidentally killed his little sister and then the parents staged it to look like a foreign faction did it It explains all the inconsistencies like why she was both struck dead and tied up and choked and sexually abused they wanted to make it look like a violent intruder or the extremely long and confusing note which includes multiple paraphrased movie quotes The basement of their house had movie posters hanging in it Patsy was ambidextrous and her handwriting was tested for her dominant hand but she easily could have used her other hand to make it look different Additionally John Ramsey said he had broke the glass in the window some weeks earlier and used it to get in the house when he had locked himself out it wasnt broken that night In the 911 call the muddled audio at the end can now be heard of the three of them talking in the kitchen before the call hangs up It appears to include John saying we are not talking to you  John and Patsy are not talking to Burke Then Patsy saying what did you do Help me Jesus asking Burke what he did Then a young boys voice clearly Burke saying what did you find This contradicts the familys testimony that Burke was in his room the whole night The parents had discovered that their older child struck and killed their younger child and in a panic decided to make it look like he hadnt done it to not lose both their children in a single night Lastly in 2013 a judge unsealed some grand jury documents related to the investigation Despite the District Attorney deciding to not bring charges it shows that the grand jury had voted to bring charges against the parents but not for murder The grand jury saw all the evidence and voted to indict John and Patsy on two counts endangering JonBenet and being accessories to a murderhiding evidence This is completely consistent with the grand jury charging the parents for allowing JonBenet to be near Burke who was a very troubled kid and for covering it up Yet the politicized DA who was friends with the Ramseys did nothing Theres little mystery left in this caseIn fact there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,
After watching his interviews back when he was still around 10 or 11 I believe he is the one who killed his sister Maybe its not in his intention to kill but he is still the person responsible for what happened to the poor girl The family is very famous and their image of a happy family is something that they must protect at all cost so thats why the parents covered up for him The reason why he is not remorseful is because I bet his parents keep on telling him that its not his fault and that it was an accident but he must not tell the truth because he didnt mean to hurt his sister Burke is jealous of his sister One of their neighbors told the investigators that Burke once hit his sister on the face and that Burke never really played with other children in the neighborhood esp when JanBenett is around,
I dont think he was smiling I agree it looks like an uncomfortable facial feature instead,
Hes parents covered him up,
Hes smiling talking about seeing her corpse,
burke 100 killed his little sister and we all know it after years of jealousy jonbenet stealing some pineapple from his bowl finally made him snap and he smashed her over the head with the flashlight that he knew was in the kitchen drawer his parents tried to cover it all up so they wouldnt be known as the ones with the murderous psycho kid its disgusting to see him sit there smiling like that makes me sick,
this is the creepiest interview ever,
Burke is an evil creepy devil,
They stayed focused They screwed up big time,
I honestly think Burke did it Nobody else besides family members were in the house The sad thing is this little girl knows exactly what happened to her and well never know Rip sweetheart,
it angers me so much that this obvious killer is sitting here making money on his kill while he only got aways because of his parents money incredible,
PizzaGate FranklinScandal CookingSpirit *Connect the dots*,
Fella sure creep smiles a lot,
Burke 100 killed her and his parents covered it over up because they didnt want to lose both children,
That smile is spine chilling,
You need to watch The Case Of Jonbenet Ramsey parts 12 I think their theory is spot on Jonbenet gets woken up to go to the toilet Afterwards she comes downstairs She takes a piece of pineapple from her brothers bowl He freaks out and hits her with a torch Unfortunately she dies and then his parents help cover it all up Theyre wealthy so they just pay the DA to keep quiet and to make it look like it was an intruder,
Its not a smile it is an insane psycho smile,
he looks nervous and guilty,
what if the identified males dna in her underpants is her bothers,
Sussssssssssssssssss,
Burke looked down when he answered with Absolutely not,
My bf and I fight a lot about my mocking or being dismissiveI smile and sometimes laugh when I am uncomfortable and its very triggering to ppls The brother looks so uncomfortable to me hes nervous,
Homicide Hunter Lt Joe Kenda should have been brought in to solve this case,
Hes hiding his pain by smiling,
I believe that the brother did it and the family covering for it ,
never look at the mouth or at a smile look at the EYES,
Cant they do a lie detector test Also if you want more information about the case I highly suggest the case of jonbent ramsey you find out a lot more about everything,
They paid this guy to defend him  I dont see a smile as much as I see an uncomfortableblah blah You yourself dont believe that Since youre a professional your insight influences others So they paid you to defend him and paint him as an shy guy when its clear he is sketchy af,
202 someone probably paid him to smile  thats my opinion Maybe its not even the real Burke ,
his eyes and smile creeps me out,
I hope I live long enough to know who did it,
This is Just Sad  You can tell when someone is Guilty or have been up to no good They Cant look you in the Eye or are really Awkward to be around  And if the Ramseys did do it I ask how could you hit your own child or stage that someone broke into the house   For the Sake of God if You Loved your child like they Claim they Did then why did they if proven guilty kill her Its Soo Wrong  I believe Burke was jealous but I Do believe He Loved her I feel like her Father put her on a pedistool and Burke couldnt cope with it and So Patsy saw this and Completely Pampered him  And tried making him number one or Noticeable ,
To be honest from day one I always felt like he did it It just best fits the evidence and parents behavior after I think it was sibling abuse that was going on awhile due to jealousy and that night it went too far The parents had to save the kid they had left So they staged the ligature and note She went willingly down there with whoever it was,
the same blow of the skull laughing the hollow of his toy in the back he does not care the end of the call and the daddy the violo the mom could hit the cranium practicing and the mom scolded her and the mom got angry and hit her in the skull and the brother hated her and had her envy,
They overlooked a broken window Excelent police work,
I think Burke killed JonBenet Burke woke up hungry he went downstairs to get pineapple and milk JonBenet then woke up probably to use the bathroom or she woke up because she Peed on herself She saw a light on downstairs went downstairs to see what was going on She then saw her brother in the kitchen eating pineapple Then she went over grabbed it with her fingers and ate a piece Burke then got mad at JonBenet for eating his pineapple JonBenet then ran downstairs to the basement Burke went chasing after her grabbed the flashlight from the kitchen and ran downstairs Burke soon caught up with JonBenet then hit her with the flashlight on her head Burke then realized what he had done He then grabbed JonBenet and dragged her to the other room He then ran back upstairs went back in his room and pretended to fall asleep Patsy and her husband both woke up to the noise and checked the house and the rooms They both saw Burke in his bed sleeping and went to check JonBenets room and found her missing so they went to check around the house for her They then went down to the basement and checked the rooms and then found JonBenets body on the ground Patsy then screamed and Bourke got out of his bed and ran to the basement Then thats when they had their conversation what did you do Patsy were not talking to you John oh Jesus oh Jesus Patsy what did you findBurke Burke thought he was slick trying to play it off When he probably killed his sister Then the parents wanted to cover it up by strangling her even though she was already dead or slowly dying Or Burke could have done all of that to her then went upstairs I dont know I just want this solved Its very sad its taking over 20 years to solve this case,
Trumps win is probably the biggest underdog story in history The media ripped him Hollywood ripped him the Democrats ripped him professors ripped and even his own party the Republicans ripped him a lot of the time And he still won Think whatever you want about him but you cant deny it was historic,
A year later Trump is hated by Degenerate rappers Hollywood rapists and pedophiles Elitist Celebrities Cop hating NFL and NBA players Establishment Republicans Democrats it makes me proud that I voted for him and confident I made the right choice,
Donald Trump the man who gave up his lavish and luxurious lifestyle and endured being ridiculed and smeared by the media to save America,
Lets do this again in 2020,
First they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win Mahatma Gandhi,
I remember crying tears of happiness when DT won Still very happy to this day,
i am the biggest fan of trumplove from india,
That night almost two years ago I joined a bunch of Deplorable groups on Facebook and met the woman of my dreams We both consider Donald Trump as the one who brought us together I love this man,
that was probably one of the best openings to a victory speech sorry to keep you waiting complicated business,
One of the greatest nights in American history The night we started the process of getting our country back,
I get all teared up thinking about that magnificent night that President Trump won I love you Donald Trump Love from Australia,
One of the few nights I have ever cried from happiness,
Many people fell to their knees this night thanking God for this win,

Air Force One 1997 soundtrack President Trump saving USA and the World,
Sorry to keep you waiting complicated business,
Can someone explain to me how is Donald Trump a racist 1 He wants to build a wall makes sense because they cant take in illegal immigrants not knowing their background and sending them back or putting them in jail etc will costs USA money and going further in debt 2 He wants to stop bringing in muslims temporarily until they can they can find a solution to Islamic Extremists issue also makes sense since Islamic Extremists is targeting USA Most of the people who are angry with Donald Trump probably cant think straight and being brainwashed by mainstream medias with fake stories about Trump and didnt read what he actually said,
This is 2020 election results  Go Trumpster,
Greatest day of my life,
I have seen it live on german TV I was so happy at this moment this was not just a victory for Trump supporters or the americans it was a victory for all patriots all over the world thank you Donald Trump and thank you voters,

I bet when hillary called trump he let it ring a couple times before answering just to make her wait,
Its been one year Damntime goes by so fast,
Magical scenes The little people voted against the corrupt establishment just like we voted brexit in the UK,
Just as epic as the Braveheart Freedom scene absolutely FANTASTIC,
i watched this victory speech like everyday since he won,
The most epic night in our history We the American citizens said we have had enough We will take our country back and we did it And after a year we still feel we made the right decision Hes keeping promises we thought were lost This man was not a politician but a businessman and the difference is politicians work for their own party and a businessman works for the entire business And this United States is his business He represents us all not just his party Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,
1 year later still amazing,
I love that he used the song from the movie Air force one with Harrison Ford MAGA,
Did you notice the Like to Dislike ratio,
When Trump enters with his family is it just me or doesnt he have the sweetest expression on his face Actually humbled He looks like he really cares,
Its coming towards the end of october 2017 and im still watching this video and being so greatful that we have such a great man for a president and so happy that im an American,
This was by far one of the best moments of my life thus far ,

TRUMPPENCE 2020,
Interesting song to have after you Walk off stage I think that was addressed to Hillary Clinton and his way of mocking her when you see her interview where she said that if she is president they will attack Iran but didnt say anything about the Iran nuclear deal to them it would have just sounded like another democrat making promises that they wouldnt live up to,
what a man would be fun to watch him one more time in 2020 to give his victory speech AGAIN ,
GOODNESS IN THIS WORLD ALWAYS PREVAILS,
he was so humble during all of this its great,
As a Hillary supporter I am not bitter nor do I hold any sort of grudge I am 26 years old tomorrow and I realize that Ive got a lot of experiences to have in my life before I can really understand what the Trump supporters believed in Honestly Im excited anyway Sure Hillary lost but you know what This is a democracy we vote and the majority rules so hey That being said I wish Trump the best of luck and congratulate him on uniting the vast majority of the United States rather than dividing it So heres to you Donald J Trump you won it fair and square and the stage is yours you talk a mighty big game with America and what we can do with it I just hope you walk an even bigger walk Dont fuck us on this buddy,
This moment will forever go down in history and the most monumental day in modern history,

Mr President welcome aboard sir,
While I enjoy watching this video every time I also feel for poor Barron tostay up all night If I was 10 I just wud hvgone tobed buthe seem to hv handled itwell,
Trump 2020,
Baron is so cute trying to stay awake I hate it when leftists try to say that hes bored or hates his dad,
I was a liberal for 30 years god I was wrong and destroyed by these liberals corrupted people This was as a Canadian the best day of my life,
what an epic night i will never forget it Mr President Donald J Trump,
I waspraying he would pronounce hillary was officially imprisoned,
Bad Decade for Liberals Change Constitution and Make them go to Siberian Labour Camps,
Please be careful mrpresident  there has Never been such a concerted effort to attack the potus and the American way of life as is going on now,
As a Hillary supporter I am not bitter nor do I hold any sort of grudge I am 26 years old tomorrow and I realize that Ive got a lot of experiences to have in my life before I can really understand what the Trump supporters believed in Honestly Im excited anyway Sure Hillary lost but you know what This is a democracy we vote and the majority rules so hey That being said I wish Trump the best of luck and congratulate him on uniting the vast majority of the United States rather than dividing it So heres to you Donald J Trump you won it fair and square and the stage is yours you talk a mighty big game with America and what we can do with it I just hope you walk an even bigger walk Ive realized that when you dont personally know the other side its a lot easier to vilify them I used to think all Trump supporters were fuckin assholes but then I really talked to a few and had a moment of enlightenment Both sides have complete puckered assholes Theres assholes everywhere but theyre not the majority At the end of the day we all want the same thing dont we We all want our country to prosper and lead the rest of the world by example We all want economic growth and happy citizens dont we Ive met some Hillary supporters that were some real tools fingersintheears tools Hell I even found a few Bernie people who I considered to be stupid fucks for choosing to not vote just because he lost out to Clinton Thats dumb We focused on the wrong things hesaidshesaid stupid trivial shit that divided us and pinned us against oneanother So I just kind said Fuck it Were all here we all want to same thing lets go get it REGARDLESS of who is at the helm,
Hispanics for Trump,
Trumph is best thing happen to US n the world,

Trump seems so moved its so great,
Way to go Mr trump  Think your a great man  All the best wishes from Canada ,
Thats my man,
That was a great day,
I will say that if Trump had made speeches like this during his campaign I wouldve been on board with him and probably voted for him I still have a very hard time taking him seriously But only time will tell if Im right or not,
That day found me sobbing like Napoleon for happy times with royalty,
God bless US and EU,

Rainbow Six El Chapos Seige,
The guy in the red jacket Im assuming team leader is like a one man army Throwing grenades giving himself cover fire storming the front lol What a badass,
For those making jokes this is some real action not just die and respawn and not blood on the screen You get shot once youll be in critical condition or can die Respect to the Mexican Marines,
worst neighbors ever,
*Fact Noone wants to be the guy that has to look under the bed or be the first one on the ladder up to the attic*,
Ladies and gentlemen We got em,
Didnt dissapoint  im sure there was more gruesome scenes but knowing how YouTube is ,
I dont need to watch Netflix Please do more of these,
Guy in the red is savage and his kit is 1010,
it would be funny if the gopro channel posted this,
Narcos Mexico Season 2 or 3 Spoilers,
When theres someone camping in the corner and you call your whole squad to kill him,
Grenade guy Now this is where you bend over *throws grenades and storms in a la Rambo*,
I look at the walls I look at the smoke I look at the toxic communication One thing comes to my mind *Rainbow Six  Siege*,
The new Mexican Rainbow Six DLC looks pretty great,
Watching this on April 26 2018 and its STILL bad ass Being Military myself I can always appreciate footage like this,
Excelente intervencion de las fuerzas especiales de la marina armada d mexico,
The Mexican police Just as deserving of respect as all servicemen are,
Who else thought that grenade blew up in his hand,
When is this game comming out,
NO FULL AUTO IN BULDING ,
Rush B in Spanish,
*FROM THE DIRECTORS THAT BROUGHT YOU CLOVERFIELD*,
fun fact they were looking for a different guy at first they never knew el chapo was there until they found him,
FBI OPEN UP Wait a minute,
This video isnt complete they cut a lot of parts look the whole complete video and you can see the part where a marine gets shot and when they show the dead Hitman of El Chapo and when the Marines throw Granadas,
Crazy how its literally a war zone in one house,
They didnt have that Jaeger device from Rainbow Six for those grenades,
They found the secret boss fight,
In Mxico when the sicarios Hitman see those gray color Cars Mxico marinesthey running they know marines are no jokethe Guy un red jacket was outside as civilian just watching that house and he decide to go inside with the teamcold bloodyou guys should see this full video,
Es lo mejor que ha podido grabar un Gopro,
*Who wears a red jacket on a raid*,
Sick graphics Almost real world like,
Call of duty should add this instead of capture the flag it could be capture el chapo,
respect,
last operator standing,
As always my favorite GRANADA 112,
*Hucks Grenade in building* Lights still work,
When you and the squad look for the guy thats been camping all game,
In rainbow six siege my dudes be rushing here they casually walk,
on every swat video i go there always must be some person who talks about rainbow six siege,
watching this while listening to *The Game  Skrillex  El Chapo*,
Im here just to listen what fortnite gamers have to say,
add a corrido song and you have your self a music video,
This was pretty damn sick,
114 come out NEVER Lmao,
Amazing graphics gun play is really smooth All round amazing game 1010 would recommend,
I remember watching this Live on Tv Damm crazy Shit,
Counter terrorist win,
boy if you dont get that got dam gernade unpinned,
Unless you were physically there or in charge of these men you do NOT tell them how to do their job They hit the target and completed the mission,
There is no capture in the video Lol he escape again in the toilets tunnel lmao,
Damn Rainbow six Vegas 3 looks badassjk,
I love Mexicans,
Man does that shit looks stressful Kudos,
Rainbow Six Siege Mexico DLC Coming Soon in 2020,
Long live Pablo Escobar Ooo wait,
Nice Teamwork  Communication skills are Pree good,
Its quite nice to have so many ex navy sealmilitary experts in the comment section,
Amazing Not a single set of balls yet they are still there for the fight VivaElChapo ,
legend say they are still throwing grenades into the building,
Damn Netflix shouldve used this footage for El Chapo series,
Rainbow six siege,
Is the helmet cam defect or is player 2 just lagging,
This happened in my city Los Mochis Sinaloa not so far from my house,
Just imagine how you just looking in window and see bunch of FBI next to your door,
This is the trailer for the next new game of Arma Arma 4,
GOPRO BE A HERO,
Getting all hypes from new SWAT game Ready or Not and youtube recommended this video to me Well you guys sometimes know what I need,
*yo digo que tocemos y digamos que es la pizzajpg xdxd*,
My question is wen the hell there military started useing M4A1s and G36Cs,
MW5 4k 60fps full ultra Nvidia Titan,
I like to see them take down my crazy ex girlfriend next,
I heard some rumors about this taid that there were actual US Navy SEALS in this raid Even if it is confirmed that they were there they will say they were never there and they dont know what youre talking about,
Capture the hostage Rainbow six siege,
Was he under the bed in that last room sounded like his wife or something,
Translation Yeah Gustavo just keep chucking nades mate,
Wonderful job from the Mexican Spec Ops Theyre professional and can be considered the nations elite,
*S T O P S H A K I N G T H E C A M E R A*,
The new map for rss looks awesome 1010 but fix spawn peaks,
Since when did rainbow six siege become a real thing,
in the end i thought it was flashbang haha,
The first guy have lag S,
This Hollywood movie is 5 rating,
wouldnt a smaller SMG be better in these circumstances instead of an assault rifle seems like it would be easier to maneuver around the building with it Are they using ARs because of the bigger round size so they can pierce body armor maybe,
Red jacket  camouflage ,
this game has good graphics and sound quality,
gotta love these Mexican marinesonce in Tijuana when the sinaloa cartel was just getting around to take over the Arellano cartel I saw 5 MARINES beat the living hell out of a Jr for trying to bribe them these guys are young n tuff Like any other MARINE,
That looked like about 50 lbs of gear on the one guys back For a CQB mission What the heck did he need that much of,
Is this a new netflix release,
*Bro THERES NO FULL AUTO IN THE BUILDING*,
Im a simple man when I see POV I click,
What i saw wasnt chaos I saw complete control NO risks situation every corner locked down Nothing random here guns are drawn and aimed precisely where targets can appear everyone has there own spot to watch covering each others back pop shots just to make sure no ones in that exact spot and if they were they be dead aiming at a doorway is much more than what it sounds enemies can appear near the bottom middle or top they can blind fire sticking there gun around the corner or they can be far away from the door but also have there sights on it ready to shoot And thats JUST the simplicity of it There is just so many variables people dont recognize even in the littlest of situations that for the life of me i couldnt explain and thats just a door they went through a whole house windows counters corners hallways that bend closets tables stairs closed doors slightly opened doors possibly not dead people blankets couches ect ect ect and those all have their own story on how to approach it loving the tacticalness these people delivered amazing how they stayed calm and textbook,
One of them has their aimlock screwing up the screen just shakes constantly,
Guy in the red jacket looks after the grenade bad move,
Im gonna ask you a Question WTF are you firin at,
And thats how Angels fighting for our lives but we dont see,
When youre drinking vodka while squatting and your boss calls you to capture El Chapo,
FBI OPEN UP,
Capitao from BOPE is meeting with Caveira,
Solo vs squad,
RAINBOW SIX SIEGE GETTING TOO REAL,
This is a BOSS fight,
They captured this bastard nicely Good job guys,
Why does he have a 203 on his rifle if its a cqb situation,
You can stop worrying about grenades now,
They should make a whole video game called King Joaquin,
Call of Duty live action,
Guys this is not a police or an army Actually this a Mexican marines,
043 lol Dalte Vuelta Chaparro Tranquilo Chaparro Hope hes okay,
El Chapo should of just left the game before he lost smh,
R6 be like,
I remember that morning the Federalies were passing us on the road when they had caught him Im glad we drove back from mexico What a dope coincidence,
Amazing Was those sounds of grenades or the sound of the balls of the Mexican marines clanging together,
If the defenders had a Rook it would have been ezy dub,
The only sort of Mexican protection service I support these men have the balls just like any other marines in the US,
Ghost Recon Wildlands 2 looks awesome,
Respect these mans,
Cmon even my airsoft GoPro cam is less shaky,
Counterterrorists win,
Rainbow Six Siege looks great on high settings,
The Gopro helmet is helping troops aim for the enemy,
Thought i was watching the new season for Rainbow Six Seige,
Fun fact El Chapo escaped from prison Escobar built his own prison,
CSGO Mexico Edition,
I dint see chapo any where faulty footage,
Chaparo Im dead,
Sick graphics very good game,
waiting for the cyber navy seals that know exactly how to do a perfect raid D,
Jesus  Ive seen airsoft team clear rooms faster ,
This is a drug war that we cant win,
So awesome to see ex and current keyboard warriors here keep defending ur virginity guys,
Amazing Mexican soldiers my respect,
Wellel chapo is smart,
wow reminds me of ghost recon wild lands,
lmaooooo im sure the lights still work after all them flashbangs n shit ahahhahahah,
14K Sinaloa cartel people have disliked this video,
I didnt know George Lopez was in the Mexican army,
Wow awesome job In another life I guess ,
the new r6 update looks fantastic,
in Soviet Russia grenade throws you,
At of all of this I thought what a nice kitchen,
I love the launcher just casually strapped on the back,
Rip their eardrums bro,
You shouldve seen how the gringos and the Colombian government took down Escobar,
050 Send this guy back His shaking for his life He aint ready,
The go pro dude giving orders but aint doing nothing ,
that one dude was washing his uniform so he brought his tracksuit jacket instead,
We need this kind of graphics and gameplay and story in games,
Waiting for new Rainbow 6 Siege Update,
Imagine this being on rainbow six siege it will be so cool,
Thats me in PUBG storming in a house in pochinki during endgame,
You can tell they didnt plan on taking prisoners alive,
Because it takes badass Mexicans to catch another badass Mexican,
FBI OPEN UP,
el policia came in 49 grenades tf deep b,
F B I  ,
our 18 yr old marines make these guys look like the airsoft brigade,
like for these soldiers bravery,
Reminds me of Zero Dark 30 but more intense,
RAINBOW SIX SEIGE AM I RIGHT GUYS XXXDDDD,
Lmaooooo they made Rainbow Six Siege into a real thing,
The new modern warfare 4 looks super dope,
Saw pov got really excited then realized this isnt pornhub,
These roblox game are getting Crazy,
Now show them how he escaped from prison LOL,
They needed to drone the room first and then ash would rush behind a montagne,
8 marines vs 20 drug dealers and just one marine got shot wow,
Hell respect to these men,
they forgot to pick blitz,
Everything is a video game now a days,
I Think one of them Guys Has a 1000 ping rn,
Were they throwing actual grenades not flashbangs Oh shyt,
El Chapo should release this DLC great graphics *Waits for keyboard warriors*,
The new rainbow six siege dlc is fire,
Is this the trailer for the new Battlefield game Looks epic,
Ether this is real or someone is the best editor ever,
*WIN WIN CHICKEN DINNER *,
FBI OPEN UP,
Imagine playing a game like this in vr,
When stealth is optional to complete this mission lol 010 032,
Why didnt they drone it out first,
I dont know what wrong with me but i feel like im an el chapo fan,
Rainbow six siege  operation  El chapo,
virtual reality rainbow six seige edition,
Holy crap what video card are you running to capture this Siege footage,
Fookin laser sights,
not mentioning that most of this soldiers were training too it was there rookie traning just imajine the expert soldiers combat,
He has and had power for people to die for him,
Irl rainbow six siege,
247 looks like someones Netflix was interrupted,
Oh God I fear a wave of rainbow six fans criticism,
Some guards of chapo probably got killed in that house,
This is better than Ghost Recon Wildlands,
asi s kmo c xingaron al xapo jusmman xdxdxd,
No one can hide from the all seeing eye of technology Unless you were born in a forest,
Chapo escaped the raid and was later found a few miles a away in a small car,
Wow Im surprised the Mexican government has took charge of the operation,
PUBG game in the real Life,
One or two random frags and youve got yourself a team kill,
Man these soldiers are courageous and all respect,
yes I think that that the marines are slow and fools I bases my critics bexause Im level 55un Calle of Duty and that prof that I am a true and brave sildier,
They should have used montagne and fuze,
This new rainbow six siege DLC looks great,
This is gonna be a part of Narcos Mexico some day,
el Chapo be like Bro quit spamming grednades wtf 1v1 me rn,
In the next Black Ops i want this map multiplayer,
Como se llama este juego v,
When my squad vs a solo in fortnite,
258 I thought that was a flash bang,
Guy in the red shirt better know as spanish soap,
I salute these men trying to clean up their country out of the narco garbage thats destroyed their country Keep it up boys,
I cant even imagine gong into a house where people are shooting That takes some courage for sure,
Guzman is a legend,
This isnt US special operations at all Exactly why it went on for so long,
If i were there i would have been Glaz Easily get em,
Meanwhile on Ghost Recon Wildlands,
I legit got nervous when I saw 2 of them standing in the killzone,
Remember when the US Marines did house to house room to room like this in Fallujah Damn them boys are hard as hell,
when your mom comes home from work on a monday,
PUBG update looking lit tho,
Id love to see the armchair warriors dissing these Marines go down there and fight the Cartels head on They wouldnt last a day,
Footage from the up coming narcos season,
Fbi open up,
Is this a leak to new rainbow six siege operators,
My advice Store some grenades,
El Chapo made 105 acconts and disliked this,
Heroes,
How can you not add subtitles to a video like this,
Ey i just wa *BOOM BOOM BOOOOOM,
Awesome go pro skills A for effort,
Mexico is powerful,
muchos se equivocan la mujer del Chapoes de Uganda fricaAll fue que yo la conoc Cuando yo estaba casando LEONAS,
When you type por,
The guy in back keeps telling the ones in front to advance into the fire The ones in front are somewhat less enthusiastic about that prospect,
Im the king of da trap El Chapo,
Comments saying this video is fake coming in 321,
Not only do they need balls to get into a strategic gun fight but they need the balls to just be the good guys in Mexico as well Awesome,
I want to never get raid ever,
Those bandits were firing back at the SWAT team El Locos,
At 300 I thought flash bang pops up xD,
Call of dity mexican,
Andale andale  Arriba arriba epa epa YeeHah  Speedy Gonzalez,
For those that are confused this is the Mexican navy and marines They were not police,
Who else felt bad for the injured soldado,
Damn Sicario 3 looks intense,
After all these gun shots grenades the light and switch still works,
Great respect to Mexican Marines from India,
Real footage of a shootout vs movie shootout scene Big difference,
the guy with the sweater though,
I give you respect and understand why you are shooting,
This the last level in a COD game Final achievement,
Too bad it wasnt the real thing The production was tho,
Counter Terrorists Win,
that was quite the messy raid,
daaang most intense rainbow six seige game i hav ever seen,
Finds nothing Leader oh maybe it was room 204,
Rainbow Six Siege in a nutshell by the way Mexican operators confirmed this is inspiring me to be a real life Rainbow Six Siege operator my destiny is to be the operator Blackbeard,
shit was lit 1010,
Re call of duty jajajajaj,
Thats how FBI find lolicon and attack them,
WellidkIm not a soldieror an officerbut that seemed really unprofessional,
Shouldve asked Sledge to open a wall and Blitz to rush on to the objective Luckily there werent any Gu mines on the way,
The Mexican werent messing around They cleared house Badass,
FBI open the door,
Ghost recon real life,
Tell those men in thank you for your service,
Narcos Season 4,
Why didnt they do the same when they captured Bin Laden,
They need to watch out for the Kapkan traps,
feels like scarface,
Playing PUBG with VR,
Csgo realistic graphic setting,
I heard the Mexican Marines in that gun battle killed 5 cartels and didnt suffer neither casualties nor injuries on the side of the law Its amazing that no Marines were injured el chapos bodyguards were using 50 caliber rifles on the marines,
Should have used the Chankla,
FBI OPEN UP,
They couldnt find El Sueno,
243 the guys making sure theres no traps on the roof before walking in,
Respect from France,
wtf  Special forces dont work like this ,
Wasnt delta force also part of this operation,
all el chapo had was a level 3 helmet and a frying pan,
Mis respetos personal que no tiene la distincin de medalla de honor y merecen medalla ms valiosa al servicio en tiempo real,
mexican marine they are not the best in the world but they do their job and I respect them,
Nice raid of this base,
The dude in red is the sweeper or sanitizer His nonchalance and calmness makes the situation look like a training video,
El chapo never existed is a lie from the cells,
where is blitz or montagne,
Mexicans do raids a lot differently than most they werent necessarily there to take him or anyone in that house alive They were tossing frag grenades into that front room not concussion or flash grenades Look at the shrapnel marks on that entire first room lol,
Rip headphone users,
This PUBG update seems pretty intense,
*warning this video is loud viewer discretion is advised*,
Rb6 when your whole squad pushes the same way,
I would have quickscoped off the building and hit a 720 trick shot,
That is battle ground  but theres a boss called EL CHAPO,
Plus SF units are made for these kind of operations,
Keeping them in prison for what Execute them how many innocents did this greasy pig kill but let me guess its cool right,
What a perfect cQb gun for an option,
Actually this raid was not intent to catch chapo Guzman it was a raid to catch el Cholo Ivan one of his main bodyguard s and ruthless killer but chapo was long gone before the military came in,
Battlefield hardline 2 looks dope,
So theyre gonna bash him because he didnt say what they wanted to hear Thats so typical,
cant believe this stoner is smarter than half the country wow,
I agree with Wayne They scream Black lives matter but then kill each other Hes offended by her question because shes pushing a different answer on him,
A white cop saved Waynes life when he was 12,
If it wasnt for Wayne it wouldnt be,
MY LIFE MATTER ESPECIALLY TO MY BITCHES  Lil Wayne,
Like if The Carter V is,
Look at the end of the day black people dont like to be criticized because theyre black and white people dont like to criticized just because theyre white Its a persons character that matters not their race,
I am a 48 years old white woman I listen to classic rock I dont listen to his music and cant even name one song he sings but that last superfluous comment made by that news anchor was totally unprofessional classless and childish Lil Wayne was a guest on your show He didnt flip over his chair in anger or assault or threaten the woman interviewing her so whether you agree with him or not show some respect He is a guest in your home so have enough class to act like it You are not some late night talk show that talks about politics and uses satire and comedy writers for your show You are journalists and a media source that delivers a more serious newsmagazine show without comedy so you should stick to reporting news and remain impartial unbiased and neutral not say or do anything to sarcastically condescendingly and unnecessarily comment on how a guest you invited to your show behaved or responded to * *your* * questioning if Lil Waynes attitude could be perceived by anyone to be inappropriate the attitude displayed by your news anchor who spoke last was way worse than Lil Waynes attitude Its acceptable for Lil Wayne to express his opinion and objection to things Hello Thats what you are interviewing him for It is not however acceptable for your news anchor to express his displeasure or even disgust with how Lil Waynes expresses his opinion and objection to things WHEN THAT IS THE VERY OBJECTIVE OF CONDUCTING AN INTERVIEW AND WAS THE VERY REASON YOUR SHOW WAS INTERVIEWING HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE Just classless,
Typical leftist BS Lil Wayne doesnt agree with them so they insult him passive aggressively,
bald guy at the end is a tool,
Lil Wayne owned that interview  ABC Respect to him He has a strong mind  can not be brainwashed An intelligent guy who thinks for himself  wont be bullied by anyone,
Im a slave for your ear thats dope from an artist perspective,
god i hate the interviewer,
The Goat,
haha that guy at the ends comment was so dumb theyre mad because they cant get him to say what they want,
sooooo let me get thi straight poeple can be offended by waynes music but he cant be offended by a question He makes music that is for people who want to hear it if it offends you than dont listen so people being offended for listening to his offensive music need to figure out their own reasoning behind why they chose to be around his music to be offended just like really the thought process of some people just baffles me,
Whos here after Carter V,
I love his perspective,
Lmao he roasted her hardcore what a boss,
racebait garbage thrown right back in their face Good for you Lil Wayne,
This never gets old lol  That Lil Wayne Carter 5 is,
Lil Wayne says he aint about all that sh*t  Well said Playa Boy black folks show try to play that black victim card every time  Aint nobody got time fo dat,
LIL WAYNE  One of the few logical celebrities alive,
350 his hat still has the tag on it LMAO,
This made my day And Lil Wayne is the 1 Greatest Rapper Of All Time period,
its not even the full interview You cant help yourselves be FAKE NEWS In the actual full interview he explains how a white cop saved his life,
Decent Classic Wayne Im connected I aint no fckin politician,
DEVIL I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU,
Stop asking celebrities to give political statements They arent your token validation robots,
This dude voice like a head in drug addict cyborg,
Marylin Manson went through the same thing,
My Life Matters now thats a movement i can get behind,
Seen him live 2016 even with the huge crowd he still noticed me and gave me his shirt very humble guy,
My life matters especially to my bitches lmao killed me,
wayne got it down big respect,
They mad because he didnt say what they wanted him to He was offended that a black woman was the one trying to egg him on to think differently,
ITS GOD FAMILY MY KIDS MUSIC AND ITS ITS WEED,
What happened to the uncut version,
Im a 56yearold white copand I like Lil Wayne Let me say that again IM A 56YEAROLD WHITE COPAND I LIKE LIL WAYNE Ive never heard ONE single song hes ever sung Ive never read ONE single word of any lyric hes ever written If I had from what Ive heard about his music it would probably fall into my personal category of offensive But I still like Lil Wayne I like him for his honesty He doesnt see color He doesnt see political preference He doesnt see age He doesnt see occupation He sees PEOPLE Yeah he smokes pot And I arrest people who smoke pot So what Just because Im a cop and arrest people who smoke pot doesnt mean Ive arrested everyone I ever encountered smoking pot Or heroin Or coke Or meth So hes a pot smoker big deal Its a part of Americas culture His life doesnt interfere with my life His life is his life My life is my life doesnt interfere with his life He knows the risks He knows I have a job to do And if our paths crossed while I was on duty I know he would respect whatever action I took He says hes a gang banger Again so what Ive rendered first aid to gang bangers Ive given money to gang bangers Ive bought gang bangers kids Christmas presents Ive had deep conversations with gang bangers Ive had gang bangers come up to when Ive been alone on a call and tell me theyve got my back So Lil Wayne is a gang banger So what Thats part of the culture in which he was brought up If our lives were reversed I too would probably be a pot smoking gang banger and hed probably be a cop I often think about things like that I could easily be him I think of the person I amand I think Im a good person but I think of how my life would be if I grew up differently I think I could have easily taken a different path but still be a good person Its about who you are What you believe Whats in your heart Whats in your soul Its about how you treat yourself How you treat your family How you treat strangers Its not judging people and automatically putting them in certain little boxes because thats what society tells us to do Its about looking that person in his eyes and lending an ear to what he has to say and opening up your heart Thats what makes you who you are And thats what I see Lil Wayne doing I see Lil Wayne as a person Not as a black person just a person I look past his tattoos and piercings and I realize on the outside were complete opposites opposites in every imaginable way But I still like what I see I like Lil Wayne Im a 56yearold white cop and yes I like Lil Wayne,
Legend,

intelligent man  amazing rapper,
mad cause wayne aint gonna be your puppet lol,

floyd Mayweather said the same thing 10 years ago,
I feel like I completely understand his point everyone wants to judge he just does him like everyone else should do  He has simply told his story and he was successful at it Many people can judge so quick but the only thing is when u people pry at others to make everything look and seem negative dont mean it is and when u start with nothing and make yourself something hell to the yeah  ownyourself Much love to you lil Wayne ,
Im a gang banger maam Gang Banger but still polite lol,
He croaks and seems ever high wonder what kinda dad he be,

Wayne and your right but what ya supposed to think when ya have had pistol pulled out on ya with claim ION want no Ni3rs in my house I believe y Michael prolly harmed himself Lord I apologize if Im not telling truth but in my heart I swear its how I feel,

Fukking Fak madia Wayne is Boss for ever,
Hes so right lil Wayne for president,
This guy is wwwwaaayyy smarter than anyone would give him credit for I kinda think he likes playing it that way as well,
One of my favorite things hes ever said not sure of exact wording but he said black people can get rich in America Hes a badass Cool dude,
What about brown lives matter just playin,
abc news kept in his reactions and cut out most of the questions leading to those reactions and he still ends up looking far more level headed than them Great job fellows,
I dont feel connected to a damn thing got nuthing to do with me If you do you crazy as shit YOU Not the camera YOU That is it right there Golden baby,
Im not black or white Im American,
He should do ASMR W magazine,
I judged this man for years labeling him as not my cup of tea *UNTIL* i watched his interviews At that point i realized he IS my cup of tea bcuz this dude is a fricken GENIUS,
Of course youre going to turn an interview into a political trap The usual,
Much respect for Lil Wayne,
How dare lil Wayne have a personal opinion,
I love Lil Wayne God bless him always,
Straight up everyones lives matterEVERYONE,
The journalist admiting that the question had no depth at the end Splendind lil wayne is my hero,
How sad when many sheep separate themselves from the flock and wonder off Specially if its your duty for payment transitsright,
the black host got triggered at the end hahaha,
Lil Wayne voice is soooooo wierd he sound like the grudge,
Fool pulled that rag out like a damn magician,
BIG UP WEEZY FROM POLAND U SAID IT REALLY GOOD  NICE JOB MR CARTER,
The vocal fry is real,
Lil Wayne doesnt ordinarily give interviews but dateline is no ordinary broadcast You and me bro gravel lot after school,
Sounds like he has one of them electric voice boxes im his throat lol,
how raw was thisss LEGEND,
Literally a legend at his craft,
I love it when he said My life matters especially to my bitches Id have loved to have seen BLMs faces at that moment,
Lol what frigging weak b*tches So because they could not get the interview to go their way to race bait him they throw him under the bus Im not a fan of his music but this was the video that got me to respect this great man He has valid points stop the frigging division,
I love love love the way lil Wayne thinks  He might of felt them pressuring him to think a certain way This is how the media is disgusting ,
Im glad Wayne stood his ground,
Linsey Davis HE TOLD YOU KEEP UP THIS LOVE Lil Wayne,
inb4 liberals expect all black people to think the same,
He has crocodile voice,
Birdman jr look we finshed or we done,
Not a politician Hahaha interviewers REALLY,
Lil Wayne you are amazing keep up the good work,
Mr Little Wayne I respect you so much for not allowing idiots try to put words in your mouth You are a very beautiful person God bless you and your family,
*Spider loc and 40 glocc should have shot him* in LA,
LOL punk at the end butthurt Wayne wouldnt bend the knee to identity politics,
Atleast the vulgar rapper admits and acknowledges who he is unlike the lying wolves in suits at dateline Scum,
516 Waynes the man free spirit lololol,
Its ok for Wayne to give his opinion but not Kayne according to the media Did I miss something,
Everyone out here bashing him for having a different opion makes me like him more,
he said really you use language but offensive by and interview lol,
We finally got Carter V tho,
I dont think he got angry at the question I think he got angry at the fact that you didnt respect his opinion If he said Yes I am 100 BlackLivesMatter or Yeah America is racists no one would have ever asked him about it again respect his opinion and maybe look deeper into it rather than trying to convince him to change,
My life matter Especially to my bitches  Bruh I love Wayne,
I respect this guy for speaking the truth,
My life matters real talk i love it Go Wayne go,
Age brings its own wisdom not taught in schools,
He does not hate white people so therefore there is something wrong with him Way to go ABC no agenda there of course not,
He was offended by a ignorant question Wayne does get into all thus politics And thats why he is a genuis Best ever best now best evergoing to be,
He got pissed when you condescend to him and set up tricky controversial questions he aint gonna take part in your BS to push your agendas,
Basically because he wont agree the white man is the enemy he gets bashed makes you think who the racists really are,
614 wayne start geeking weed n syrup till i die,
He didnt want to get involve in the nonsense movement racism is a lie to divide and concur the working class,
the news is prolly the most dangerous thing for democracy high key,
Lol Wayne has the best reactions,
Oh yeah yeah,
typical media you better say what we wanna hear or else,
Reporters were offended by his answer because they want division Love lil Wayne all respect to him,
Lol that baldies tripping On that last statement I was like bruh wut,
Wayne truly seems to understand the need to separate politics from your profession cause it will destroy it every time,
So yall not gonna say nun bout him pullin out that flag like it was cool,
Lil wayne dont care he got 10 bathrooms and he can shit all day,
Lil Wayne is a goddamn legend,
This man is one smart man and unapologetic,
Exactly Hes a corny dude,
Show me some respek all yaw You done or you trew  Birdman,
The man forms his own opinions based on his own experiences and leaves the work of cultural segregation to the media Much respect for a man who says what he means rare in todays world Not in Waynes world,
This lady was acting rude and instigating a controversial response from Wayne that why she gets,
lil wayne knows exactly whats up,
I like Wayne but not pulling out the bloods bandana,
And he loves his mum good man,
awesome enlightening final words im not a fucking politician kinda rude to attempt to use a star to perpetuate a political agenda shame shame on ABC to insinuate hes was offended by a question and not the blatant manipulation of lil wayne disgusting fake news,
They found every picture they could of him smoking and drinking,
Lmfao this look like a damn interview from 2008 with the intro and then the questions and narration,
He blew her mind when he basically said Im a rich black man in America so that should tell you that America is not racist and when he mentioned having so many white fans,
Lil Wayne placed you exactly where you belong You wanted to create divisions but he too smart for you,
Id be angry too if the media and everyone else kept trying to get me to accept their narrative Hes said it over and over he doesnt see racism and hasnt experienced it People are so mad because he refuses to play their games,
after watching Waynes deposition Im certain this man is very clever lol,
This is a beautiful AMERICAN MAN,
Hell yeah Weezy,
Wayne doesnt care what we think Yeah because 99 of interviewers are ignorant stubborn biased nimrods,
ABC American brainwashing channel,
What a snarky selfserving quip at the end from an outlet that careful edits interviews to manufacture a message  and LW had the intelligence to see what they were trying to do to him and took the initiative to stop it He was cool before I saw this now that Ive seen this interview handled like master conducting an orchestra just tell me where I sign up for his army,
ABC got burned playing with fire,
LIL WAYNE U A REAL ONE,
Respect for Lil Wayne This is what a brave independent opinion looks like stop clapping when people tow the line,
The liberals are on the wrong side of history ,
Publicity Stunt after Publicity StuntI hope everyone realized that,
Have a lot of respect for this man,
What is your relationship with weed How do you self describe gangster GURL,
Weezy a legend he ahead of his mans hated him when this came out but now everybody praises him,
Red rag came outta nowhere,
And he loves God good man hes actually got his head screwed on the right way,
In the skate board scene he had a tag on his hat,
Why is it cut so awkwardly to complete different parts of the interview lol,
One of the GOATS,
Lil Wayne would be perfect for one of those smoking ads with the people that have that thing in there throat,
God bless you Lil Wayne,
Wow I actually gained a little Respect for Wayne on that one thanks ABC,
Thug life is real,
crafty and calculating OK Journalist is easily impressed,
all lives matter except for the ones that want to cause harm,
He only acted that way to not affect his sales and popularity Str8 up He dont even believe that crazy shit he just said And admitted to be a blood Really Man please,
Lil Wayne is the man,
tagline picture  he could probably trip out forever in this one photo  Joe  impractical  any ideas for nicks punishment ,
lil wayne is a genius,
simplehe doesnt impose ideology on anybody If you wanna get offended thats your problem,
His feelings were hurt guess he needed his safe place,
Keeps it  Plain and simple,
Yall tried to make him seem bad and failed lmao C5 was HUGE,
600 deally,
They skipped the questions that made him angry and just showed his reaction What a load of bollocks Wayne is a great guy Offended by a question the reporter said at the end Well please show us that question so we can make a judgement ourselves dont skip the question and just show us his reaction to a question no one has a clue about,
Good dude right there much respect,
ABC News just report it and leave out your rhetoric,
Sad how whenever a black guy wants to stand up and not play the victim other blacks want to tear him down Ostracize him and label him as uncletom or auntjemima for black women,
funny how bunch of thugs are able to inspire some people they couldnt find anyone better,
Lol he was going off Hes not racist He basically trying to say anyones life matters,
This is a man who forms his own opinions and not influenced by left wing politics,
I think he just told you people that he is no f****** politician,
LOVE this man,
Wayne so real and within my top 3 rappers,
I dont like Lil Wayne that much but I totally respect his answer in that interview If none of these knuckleheads understood his reaction theyre dumb as a doorknob,
Carter v out now,
Yeah but axe lil wang to change a tire or cook a meal Cant do it,
I know nothing about this guy but his attitude about humanity is pretty awesome and refreshing,
You can save your bulshit on yo memory card,
They forgot to use hes a credit to your race,
Dont let money change you he rapped it best and yet you can see the weed messed him up,
*im gonna marry him*,
LOLnot all black people have to buy into the racism of black lives mattersome black people want to put racial politics behind them and just live life as regular people without segregation by color,
Lil Wayne you are slowing down,
Every live matter but in reality does it really does it really is the papers and government playing us against each other,
Wayne forever solidified his place in humanity for this one Stand up for GOD and peace Wayne is no sellout,
Lil Waynes low cracking voice makes my throat hurt,
BLM IS BULL CRAP I AGREE WITH MY HOMIE LIL WAYNE 3,
Is it me or does this guys voice just sound robotic af,
They set him up for that last question,
I have a whole new level of respect lil Wayne,
LIL WAYNE IS WOKE FAM,
People always talking black lives matter but we out here killing each other Putting each other down and that why people feel separated So I agree with Wayne too,
2018 2019,
He sounds like he been kicked in the throat and forced to speak,
That guys pretty smartgood to see,
Notice he put that L across his chest for Lucifer 039,
He tried to reply properly she insulted his intelligence He is not rude just real And quiet try to understand him more instead of bashing him not that he cares,
The first Lil the real Lil ,
I thought he didnt remember his 8 months in prison,
The thing is he answered the questions the we he sees it as so he can only be commended for the way he answered the questions more power to him,
He has been making music for a while but not 25 years,
no lives matter,
Such a sexy voice,
His electric verse I dont know about that but his first solo album was VERY good he made it with VERY minimal cursing The New Wayne I cant really feel probably because im older now I like cash money in the late 90s But im from the NAS Redman Death Row No limit era,
Merci famille N Yeeeees,
This ABC upload REMOVES PART OF WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT THE CAMERA MAN that you see in other versions THEY HAVE DOCTORED THEIR YOUTUBE UPLOAD and took out points he made MISLEADING MEDIA,
Wheres Ja Get Ja on the phone we need to hear what he thinks about this,
Anyone who says they are humble are living moronsonoxy or whatever that word is,
Wayne THE GOAT,
I never had respect for Lil Wayne until I saw his reaction to that race baiting question on this video Now I comprehend why he is rich and successful I finally saw a glimpse of the Man behind the tattoosThe interviewer was clueless of who she was dealing withHe didnt look angry to meit looked more like defiance and disappointed Real recognizes Real Im 40 white successful male former SoldierThe first thing you learn when bullets are flying and your ass is on the line Race doesnt matter There are no racists in foxholes,
Lil Wayne reminds me of the 2007 when none of this race social justice and political correctness BS mattered,
BLMif your not all inyour blackness is questioned,
Id be pissed too if I they were saying my life didnt matter,
I finally get this guy I love Lil Wayne ,
I love Wayne but this is hella ignorant,
Why does he sound like a robot Did his autotune become a part of him LOL,
She got a moustache fam Its above her top lift if you wondering ,
He said i am a slave to your ear that have a lot of meaning for me who came from the ear of africa,
FIGURES IT TOOK LIL WAYNE TO SET THESE MFERS STRAIGHT,
Fair play to him The second he worked out it was an identity politics exercise he called it Yes he was offended You offended Lil Wayne,
Wayne sticking up for his own opinion lets gooo,
Personally i feel like black live matter is a government coverup,
Bro the milk dud at the end made me cringe,
its okHe just uses the LABELANONYMOUSLYit s not offensive IFHe uses the LABELS NONSPECIFICALLY BUT HE HAS A PROBLEM IF THE LABEL IS DIRECTED AT HIS*,
What Black lives matter  My life matter I laughed as a hell,
Aint no one care about this doodoo interview,
205 lmaoooo,
Greatest Rapper Alive,
I used to hate lil Wayne but now Hes my Idollol,
His voice makes my ears vibrate,
It got political thats why I understand why lil Wayne got upset,
My man,
That girl got a mustache lmao,
I love this guy,
I love his mind,
Ha he pulled that flag out Respect,
Lives matter The end,
Lil wayne just blasted all of you all Damn and ABC wanted and exspected him to be a coward and a sheep HA Nah bro Not Lil Wayne,
Sounds like he got a hole in his throat and needs those lil things to talk,
I KEEPS IT REAL,
He knows what color the people are that buy 90  of his product Wayne loves white folks,
*Im gonna marry him* Oh K then,
I see you edited out the part where the white cop saved his life and the black cops stepped over him while he had a bullet hole in his chest,
may God forgave Lil for his doing,
The elite class must keep the working class divided Hwen people are their perceptions are easier to manipulate Racism is a tool used by the elite class Wake up people,
disliked cause of that bald guy in the end,
The thumbnail summarizes the video,
Hes tired of being asked his political opinion when he holds no office Leave the man alone his political opinion is none of our damn business The bald Ahole is just pissed that he wont pick a side,
So sad to see I cant support foolishness,
I think after smoking 5 million blunts he would realise that your throat brain and overall health matters,
Respect,
0025 yooooooo someone keep an eye on that girl Im scared for Weezy,
I think he didnt want to be associated with any political movement and the fact that the person conducting the interview tried to push the envelope made him irritated Nightline was trying to force him to say something he didnt want to say I was never a huge LW fan but after seeing this I have a lot more respect for him and not as much respect for nightline,
Pretty sure ABC News if my thoughts dont perfectly allign with yours you have no interest in hearing them If ones agenda matters more than integrity and dignity somethings off,
he sounds like a gremlin,
Lil Wayne seems like a really cool dude to hang with He has your back if you have his,
Thank you lil Wayne,
Of course hes pissed he keeps telling you people he doesnt believe in racism so stop asking I respect him,
A true humble rebel,
Yeayya Love him even more now,
No Lives Matter how about that,
Weezy is a genius,
Oh she was mad when he didnt bow to black lives matter haha,
This is the voice of the jinn inside him,
Lmaoy nigga litt u MAM,
He did the right and thats my thought,
Really doubt hes only smoking weed,
I LIKE HIM EVEN MORE He knows whats up The MSN is OFFFF They fuel Hate and Divide They DONT HELP ANYONE EXCEPT THE RICH Shame on them all,
Cool its Whoopi Goldberg,
  _,
News walo loda choose lo tum,
I completely agree with Lil Wayne he is an artist and not a politician He came on the show to talk about his music and the interviewer tried to push the questions in a different opinion He actually talked about his own personal experiences about having connected with so many different people of so many different races that supported his music Saying how most of America actually isnt racist from what hes seen and the honest truth that he never encountered racism Thats what offends these reporters He is not a politician he is not supposed to have a politically correct response And I bet those reporters never encountered any racism in their life either they are just parroting an idea they believe makes them appear more likable to an audience without thinking for themselves I have respect for Lil Wayne after this interview Long comment for something no one is going to read lol but I had to say my piece,
Its a real shame that the media are such terrible people to try to bully someone They talk about freedom of speech and then when someone has their own FREE OPINION they shun him and make fun of him,
Yall cant just play back that azz up like that,
he sounds like a but i appreciate him,
Wayne a cool cat big fan here keep it up or retire he did great,
Lol libtard fails epic style,
Im not a huge fan of his music but I definitely agree with everything he has said,
Bias Little Mechanisms BLM,
Lil is music welkm to kenya,
I like lil Wayne but its seem as if he was high on drugs when he participated in this interview,
the presenters of this show are hush puppy 2018 nov Carter5,
BLM do no matter All lives Matter that should not be an organization but a moral code,
Leave Dwayne Michael Carter Jr alone he deserves some peace and quiet,
I cant stand the way he and birdman speaks,
This guy is sick,
that was a black on black interview and look how it ended,
Its just so sad when you see the media using a portion of your opinion to twist things around All he says was because hes successful and doing good for a black individual it shows to him that black lives do matter and he doesnt see a need to attach himself to the movement Hes calling himself a living testimony that black lives do matter cmon guys Everyone has their own perception and in life only God actually knows your heart,
Sounds grown up now,
A guy got 6 months for raping an unconscious girl behind a dumpster and this guy got 17 years for stealing a purse and he didnt even do it,
Im just confused on why they put him in jail for 17 years for theft,
No money can repay what hes been through he missed his daughters life that time was priceless,

I hope that my six other lookalikes dont lead me into trouble,

Are they just going to ignore the fact he got 17 plus years for supposedly stealing a fkn purse,
Eye witness should be put behind the bars,
This is bull but Im glad the students helped This man should be compensated,
17 years imagine knowing your innocent but you still have to do your time even though it wasnt you god bless him man for real,
And he didnt even steal the purse Sigh,
They should give you the amounts of money you can make by that time,
The students studying at the school of law are awesome for freeing the innocent man,

Well Praise God For Blessing This Man To Be Free We All Make Mistakes Congratulations Jesus Will Always Be On His Side,

17 years for stealing a purse,
OMG 17 fuckn years this poor man spent in prison The state should pay him for the time he spent in jail,
never judge a book by its coverIndeed,
so basically an innocent man went to prison for 17 years because he had the same complexion and cornrows as the actual perpetrator for stealing a purse at that,
They should give him 17 mil 1milliom for each year he lost of his life,
I heard stories but never knew two people can look alike same damn cant believe my eyes,
Some of my doppelgangers look like me and the others look like my look alikes Its a mixed bag which was stolen,

NOBODY should spend 17 years in prison for stealing a purse wtf,
The system is SO messed up Mainly for black people,
This happened to a friend of mine Michael VonAllmen He was innocent also and finally got released after his look a like was finally caught after he spent years in prison so sad,
wait they just thought his face looked same and just locked him up They didnt go through his identification or background checks facepalm,
OMGI see a Civil case here The authorities have to compensate this young man for those 17 years he was incarcerated,
Its so sick to watch how some people are treated on this earthhe needs to be awarded millions,
Poor guy he didnt deserve to be in jail for that long,
his profile mug shot looks exactly like SAN GARNIER,
In india stealing purse will never sentence you for prison Because our police are very friendly nature bribe,
My heart goes out to these men,
He better get money for this,
His government must pay him Of the 17 years that he lost on his life,
Can he be given compensation for lost of his precious life,
Wtf Steals a purse17 years Murder10 years Seriously like wtf,
Wait hold up 17 years for stealing a purse Man Child molesters get less edit  thank you for the likes and for agreeing with me and I know one of you said that he and I I quote he stole from a WOMAN I know he did but at the end of the day that is an everyday item that can be replaced but they ended up making up a whole commotion about it and putting an innocent man in jail for lack of evidence and for relying on the vision and memory of a woman who didnt even remember the face of the damn man But still the innocent man is out now but his life was wasted in a cell and jail for nothing,
Give that man 17k and the other 11k,
It pains me to think how many innocent peoples lives were destroyed by the CJ system,
17 years for attempting to steal a purse Isnt that a bit of an excessive punishment Wow,
OMG  Im married to another one of his doppelgangers cause him and my husband could be twins I wish I could post a pic on here,
I really hope this person sues,
Any compensation from the government for income lost during time incarcerated,
I dont get how the man found out about his doppelgnger while being in prison Im not a native speaker of English,
He needs to sue the court the judge the police and everyone responsible for losing 17 years of his lifeshame on them,
Sean Garnier is that you,
The line up had one light skinned guy and the rest were really dark,
The real criminal looks like R Kellys red bone brother,
a 17 years for stealing a purse b my dad went to jail for 7 weeks for violence,
049 omg the man in the right is a Michael jackson lookalike,
doppelganger thats crazy,
17 years for stealing a purse We need justice reform That was a waste of a life and a whole lot of public money,
Y is nobody talking about how grt this guy looks aftr 17yrs in jailU still av a lot of yrs ahead of u manthank God,
Yet people steal fortnite accounts and only get banned,
He held on strong to that look though,
He hasnt aged in 17 years Wow,
lol that no physical evidence got me  He better sue tf out of someone,
Boggest *L*of his life,
Wait he did 17 years for attempting to rob a purse Wow the American justice system really works,
Did he get some money though,
His lookalike  Colin Kaepernick Lock him up,
How sad knowing that you are innocent and not being able to get anybody to believe in you,
I hope he got compensation behind his state foolishness,
And tell me plz how can you give back this guy the time he wasted,
Crazy things happening to this worldsorry John,
The governent must pay this guy for stealing 17 years of FREEDOM of his life Gosh,
damnrespect for this man hanging on for so many years,
No one should be in jail for 17 YEARS for stealing a PURSE,
I feel so pissed for that guy I would want to kill the judge or atleast throw him in jail for ever,
The man or woman who put this guy in prison should receive the same sentence,
They shouldnt allow witness ids Too many wrongful convictions They dont allow lie detectors which I would trust more than a jury Do more detective work for the innocent then prove the guilt,
That so scary poor guy spent 17 years behind bars for the crime he never committed he deserves compensation,
What if this happened on a death penalty case Huh They might result to killing an innocent man,
Wtf with that lineup the other guys you can only see their eyes  no wonder,
Lookalike I dont think so more like half blood Need to take the dad in for questioning,
The state better give that man something for time lost,
Eyewitness is enough to put people in jail,
The judicial system in this country is so flawed I assume they received a large indemnity,
These two men dont even look a like Not even by their faces Truly they did a lot of damage sending an innocent man to prison,
Really17 years with no Evidence  Very sad,
I stole every girls heart Now Im in love lockdown and the warden is my babies mom,
Damn their resemblance is really shocking,
17 years for a robbery yet murders often walk away with less like WTF,
Youre talkin about 17 years ago and a doppelganger The witnesses saw who they saw this gentleman looked exactly like him,
When your realize this isnt the onion,
Time to for lawsuit And law students cant practice law and take cases,
So sad he cant ever get those 17 years of his life back They better pay him millions for that mistake smh,
You can spend 17 years in jail solely on one persons memory or perceived memory,
Imagine if he was killed in prison before finding out he was innocent,
It a sad reality that our justice system is broken The good thing is that he prayed and prayedGod is good all the time,
17 years in prison for stealing a purse In Germany you get 15 years maximum for murder,
so what did he get in return some sort of compensation n d justice system that unjustly kept him there True justiceonly God,
17 years for a purse Cartel members get less than that,
I sorry for you man but your story gives me hope I you can do after all those years then I can do it also,
Hope David Beckham doesnt commit any crimes cause he is my doppelgnger,
Double gangers are always DANGEROUS I was almost beaten up by a guy Thinking i am the Lady who abused HIM,
As Tupac said And even thou you innocent you still a n*gga so they figure Rather have you behind bars than triggers it aint easy,
The people that put away innocent never face any charges so this will continue,
17 years While parents who wrapped up their six year old son in chaines threw him into a closet starved him and smeared faeces in his face gets 4 and a half years and only serve 2 and a half Sigh what is wrong with the US justice system,
life is a trip carnel,
ITs my pet pieve when people are wrongfully convicted May he live a happy life by making good choices I see others feel like I do  being given 17 years for stealing a purse is insane,
whats happening in todays world it wasnt 17 years it was more he was only found not guilty after 17 years,
I believe it was Rick Fox who did it,
Who purse did he steal for 17 years,
Okay but 17 years for a purse and no evidence,
Jesus Christ was it a Gucci purse,
Dame bro 17 years make them pay man,
He got robbed 17 years of his life,
17 years for stealing a purse  10 years for sexual assault  Wow,
70 of wrongly convictions based on eye witnesses SMH Everyone is a suspect than,
Every state is different about punishment I think overall the left leaning states underpunishRt leaning go too far17 years is nuts,
17 years for stealing a purse,
Sue sue them all he deserves to be free in all areas now he should be able to walk in any store to get anything he wants for free I want him to be happy17 bloody years this is crazyyyy its not fairhe can never get those years back I hope he lives the rest of his life in happiness and peace,
17 years for stealing thats a long time even for the thief,
this is america,
If some guy stole my purse i wouldnt even want him to spend 17 years in prison lol Give him some community service and a month in jail He mustve had quite the record maybe even on parole,
Im glad the guy was set free Wish he was never wrongly convicted,
He deserves a settlement he lost 17 years of his life,
What 17 years in jail for stealing a purse No dnamatch no prove Justice for Richard,
Wow Just wow,
Thats why eye witness isnt enough for a conviction anymore if not back by evidence,
Oh whoops Sorry i accidentally locked you in a prison cell for 17 years Sorry,
these students were able to figure out his was innocent just by going to google the court was so incumbent they didnt care they just wanted man in Jail to use him as slave Lets sue the courts for millions,
Wait 17 years for attempting to steal a purse Hold up what state is that,
And ofcourse nobody made a mistake,
They should make a movie on this,
The judge is racist for sentencing him 17 years for that,
Was the purse worth 1million dollars Like seriously 17 yrs,
The funny thing is I know another dude that looks like both of them,
I think you need more than eyewitness statementsNose and eyebrows are differentHe is handsome though,
040 I literally said thats the same person lol lmao,
different nose different ears different jaw,
They should pay him some money for all the years he couldnt work and couldnt take care of his family,
The investor not doing the job well same with the judge they deserved also 17 years in jail thats fair justice,
 And they only gave him a miezaly 11 million dollars compensation If he were working those 15 or 17 years his salary comes to,
they put all dark ppl  1 light person in the line up,
This shows that the Clone Wars was not fake at all,
the crazy part of this story is he got 17 years for stealing a purse,
Damn they do look like twins tho,
Oh my god seriously,
This news tv is better than def news get it,
Who gets 17 years for stealing a purse Thats a disgraceful judicial system Plus the guy was innocent How can you get back 17 years of your life My goodness Hope he sues the hell out of the state even though it cannot compensate for what he lost,
17 years for a purse snatch meanwhile Zimmerman killed a kid and didnt serve a day,
I wanna punch them in the face real hard this just makes me mad,
US GOVERNMENT SHOULD PAY THIS MAN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
Ending line maybe the giveaway Doing it right this time,
Assuming it was true how can someone spend 17 years in Prison for stealing a purse This is inhuman,
His life was ruined they better at least pay him a lot of money for tbe time they took away from him,
That stupid eye witnessif its mei swear i can now come back for you,
17 years for stealing a purse,
Guilty until proven innocent,
There should be more evidence not just eye witnesses In any case,
Wow America owes this man tax free for life land a home a few million dollars,
He should sue the city and get some money if i was locked up for that long i better get at lease 1 million dollars,
Hold up what happened to his alibi  99 of Puerto Ricans love that goatee and thin wanna be beard look,
17yrs lost his life,
Boy finna get paid,
oh god  they look the same  thats crazy,
I wouldnt have Shit to say to herThis just me,
Do you all see that line up So wrong,
God answered his prayers and his family God bless him for faith unwavering and more than a conqueror Romans 8 2837,
Bad police work No one to blame but a terrible case and laziness to find the truth,
17 years for a stolen purse 17 damn years smh,
Theft has no bail 17 yrs for stealing a purse thats crazy,
Now that judge will sell his family to pay that man,
Kc from Kansas City Missouri,
I would just cry you can never take back those 17 years,
And at the time he was convicted everyone would have been screaming animal lock him up and throw away the key,
Lol wtf the witness said thin and tan so they put him in a lineup with all dark bro Of course the witness is gonna pick him he is the only tan looking one,
GOD IS GOING TO RESTORE THE 17 YEARS HE LOST BEHIND BARS HE SHOULD SUE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE REAL PERSON WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME GOT TO LIVE HIS LIFE ITS JUST NOT FAIR,
Even if guilty 20years is too much,
They wasted 17 years of his life,
A bizarre story about man wronguflly imprisoned turns into a feel good story about doppelgangers,
dang i would sue them a life time supply of money,
God Bless You Man,
This is so typical People doing jail time with no actual evidence just someone pointing a finger,
They better give him 17 million dollars for the 17 years he spent in jail,
You musta had a long rap sheet,
throw the whole system away,
can the judge the police and detectives go to prison too for not doing their job right give the man back his 17 years in prison,
i know money isnt the answer as far as what mightve happened to him in that time that he spent behind barswhat mightve happened to his psyche to him but he HIGHLY deserves monetary compensation from that deptfrom that citysomething ,
How do u get 17 years for taking a purse,
Shows how trash the US is thousands of wrongfully convictions and 17 years for a purse theft,
Kansas City is in Missouri,
I think its not mistakin look at his eyebrow almost the same from the wanted picture list its my opinion dont hate me,
I will keep an eye to my twin,
If you look closely they have different eyes lips and noses,
Eye witnesses testimonies should be a make pr break type of situation There is so much issues witht that,
tell this to brett kevanugh over there everyone jumped the gun,
He sound and kinda look like riff raff,
Justice system will throw you in right or wrong,
This is a pure example of how the law enforcement is not properly balanced A man stays behind bars for 17 years and is found innocent after For 17 years they rely on one eye witness but does not bother to investigate further Quite disappointing,
Can u help me find a lookalike haha,
How do prisoners wait along time,
17 years for purse theft I rather live in North Korea,
Acts 238 Bible to all God Bless,
17 YEARS FOR A PURSE JESUS CHRIST,
The prosecutor should go to jail Not only was there not shred of evidence the man in question clearly had a alibi He never should have been locked up in the first place,
I have twin in a distant cousin And while I was driving I saw myself walkingmy heart stopped I was likethat lady looks like me,
So scary that u can be put in jail for doing nothing,
That was the absolute worst mugshot line up He was the only person that you could clearly see,
Our justice system is guilty until proven innocent what a shame,
17 years for stealing a purse damn 69 got it easy,
But rapist can get away free or just 6 years behind bars Ok universe,
The cops sent me to jail just because im pale and im a straight white male and i look like that guy that looks like he committed fraud in the mail,
time to throw that witness in jail for 17 years and see how it feels,
Firstly 17 years behind bars for stealing a purse wtf  And secondly I hope he sues the state for wrongful conviction and is justly compensated,
Suddenly I dont wanna find my doppelganger,
God bless youu brah Yu my brother,
Man it no apologies that can give this man he lost a lot then the system dont believe them long they have someone then their fine,

I just found out people dont believe in evolution Crazy,
*IM SORRY BUT* *THE MIRROR FALLING ON THE KITTEN BROKE MY HEART*,
My body is my temple ancient and crumbling,
Ok but did someone help the cat,
Proof of evolution that you can find on your body *looks at entire body sees that I am not a single cell organism* Oh cool,
*A COMMON MISCONCEPTION is that evolution should lead to some particular trait* such as a large brain There is no goal to evolution not speed not strength not intelligence and certainly not humanity Evolution is about one thing survival Evolution occurs at the molecular level Mutations occur with every cell division and replication in every living species Those mutations are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms It is the then current environment which wields the pruning shears favoring those mutations that best suit the organism for that environment Apes that stayed in the forest became todays chimps bonobos orangs and gorillas They are very well suited for their environments One that opted for the savanna faced different evolutionary pressures that set it on a different evolutionary trajectory The modern human brain is about 2 of total body mass yet is requires fully 20 of total caloric consumption I think you can understand that for most animals it is a daily challenge to consume enough calories just to survive and a larger brain would be more of a burden than an asset It is also the case that the larger human brain requires that babies be born at a less advanced stage of neural development placing an additional burden primarily on the mother Japanese researchers have compared brain scans of baby macaques chimps and human children and found that brain volume for both chimp and human babies increase at three times the rate of infant macaques however during early childhood human brain expansion was twice that of chimpanzees due to rapid growth of connections between brain cells In the human infant fully 60 of caloric intake go into neuronal development For just about any other species the necessity for such a long childhood would place them at a survival disadvantage We are just now beginning to understand the environmental pressures that lead to a larger brain increasingly complex social networks the development of language that enabled a culture built around tool manufacture and use and cooperative hunting no doubt played a role The challenges of a rapidly changing climate may also have been a contributing factor But if it had not been for the development of language humanity would have had to continuously reinvent the Acheulian Hand Axe Two factors allowing human speech are the hyoid bone also present in Neanderthals to which the muscles of the tongue are attached and a particular variant of the FOXP2 gene found in other mammals that allows for complex speech Humans share this variant with both Neanderthal and Denisovans indicating that it was inherited from a common ancestor Neither chimps bonobos or other apes have that variation indicating that it arose sometime after the species diverged So yes the human evolutionary history is indeed complex but as Richard Feinman said Science is the joy of finding things out We are getting a lot of clues as to the expansion of the human brain from embryology and comparative genomics but we see a progression in brain size from early mammals to primates to monkeys to apes and to humans It may be of interest to you to know that while most mammal brains are smooth primate brains have convolutions which increase the surface area of the cortex we see increased convolutions from monkeys to apes and more in humans See Molecular evolution of FOXP2 a gene involved in speech and language Wolfgang Enard Molly Przeworski Simon E Fisher Cecilia S L Lai Victor Wiebe Takashi Kitano Anthony P Monaco Svante Pbo Nature 418 869  872 22 Aug 2002 httpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalv418n6900fullnature01025html,
WHATS UP WITH 231,
Some people cant believe evolution but believe a girl is made from a single rib,
Apparently some flatearthers still have tiny remnants of a brain,
**sound of crying creationists**,
BRO WE WAS ALL FURRIES,
Want proof of evolution look at your dog,
when it comes to religion and science i choose science because if science goes wrong it simply acknowledges it and corrects it but when religion goes wrong history books are written in the name of god eliminating those who have pointed the mistakes of religion,
If all humans came from Adam and eve doesnt that mean we are all incest,
That moment when you cant find the bad comments because all the comments are about the bad comments,
all i need to see is the thumbnail i thought more Italians would be offended here,
We are made of star stuff we are a way for the universe to know itself  Carl Sagan,
Okay not related but AYY ALL INDIAN SCIENTISTS AT 316 WOOHOO,
A puffy pigeon on a cold day literally made me laugh out loud,
I cant be the only one who came here just to see the religious arguments can I,
Anyone else have that muscle in one wrist but not the other,
Oof Im losing braincells as I read some of the comments,
I have the palmaris longus thingy on my right hand but not on the left When i press harder it shows up,
I used to reject evolution because of my religious beliefs But I stopped being in denial I lived ignorant but I didnt want to die that way,
Evolution is a lie Jesus is real I saw it in a movie,
I have that wrist tendon in the wrist of my right hand but it is missing for my left hand Odd but cool,
Im a christian and agree 100 with what science shows both arent mutually excludent So calm down 12 years old atheists,
This is fake we all know that we were created by shaggy when he seazed,
My ear will twitch whenever there is a sudden sound,
Puffy pigon Im calling all floofy birds puffy now,

I have both tendons The left one is more exposed though,
I havent got that first thing and i can move my ear,
Evolution cant melt steel beams,

*thE KITTEN W THE MIRROR LMAO WHY AM I LAUGHING*,
the like to dislike ratio though,
BruhI have a 2cm taildoes it mean in handicapped,
this comment section is drowning in butthurt christian tears *EDIT* I think the funniest part of reading the replies is that Im not even an atheist,
I Approve,
hol up i dont have that god damn muscle,
What about wisdom teeth,
my ancestor was named thanos I snapped a cat somewhere,
Bruh my friends used to be like yo flex your arm like this and you see a muscle and whenever I did it nothing happened they thought I wasnt doing it hard enough but now I know Im just more evolved haha,
Vestigial structures and behaviours  just another collection of just so stories for evolutionists When natural selection supposedly confirms a structure or behaviour it evolved but when natural selection fails to remove a structure or behaviour it also evolved and evolutionists call them vestigial Epic face palm,

Eventhough im a moslim i believed both evolution of human and adam eve stories,
Yeah but in a book I read all of this is wrong Checkmate atheists,
I have the palmaris longus in both my arms,
I have all of them I am more Animalistic than you,
I have the tendon thing on my left arm and not on my right,
Our tails are our butts lol JkI know they are not,
I love how evolutions evidence is in everyone face and the Christians still cant find that snake with vocal cords,
I have the arm muscle in both of my hands,

*HOW EVOLUTION WORKS* It is helpful to understand that evolution is a molecular process The random mutations that naturally occur during cell division and replication mitosis and meiosis are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms Mutations are ongoing and continuous for every living species Those mutations are subjected to a selection process that is performed by whatever environment the organisms find themselves In this respect evolution is an ongoing continuous set of experiments Those that work get perpetuated those that dont perish It is as if the environment acted as an umpire who says There are good mutations and there are bad mutations and there are neutral mutations but they aint nuthin until I the environment calls em That is Natural Selection Neutral mutations just go along for the ride without producing immediate benefit Genetic Drift The result of those selection processes is organisms best suited for their current environment Should that environment change it would put the population under stress If the population gene pool has sufficient genetic variation it increases the likelihood that at least some offspring should be able to survive and perpetuate the species albeit one of slightly different genetic makeup What you should understand is that genetic changes do not occur because of some need The mutations are RANDOM and get selected if they are USEFUL That is a process and it is anything BUT random Lets take the example of the Panda Bears in general are omnivores eating plant matter but with a marked preference for meat when available The preferred food of the Panda however is bamboo leaves which have such low nutritional value that they must eat almost continuously The Panda would certainly be able to extract more nutrition with a four chambered stomach as in ungulates and whales or something akin to a cecal valve but it has neither in its genetic toolbox In feeding themselves pandas are continuously stripping bamboo leaves from their stalks a process that could be facilitated if they had a thumb Bears however do not have thumbs nor do they have genes for them in their genetic toolbox Nor do new features simply spring into existence However if a slightly altered body component provides some benefit natural selection will perpetuate it Evolution results in incremental alterations to what is already there As an analogy imagine a robot gardener dragging a hose around various obstacles it encounters in a garden until it can go no further Now an intelligent gardener could simply retrace his steps and take a different path avoiding those obstacles The robot gardener evolution is not an intelligent force and cannot do that With a limited tool kit it can only figuratively add more hose to get the job done While a thumb would be quite useful to a panda for stripping leaves evolution cannot rewind to produce one Instead it has taken a piece of hose a wrist bone and enlarged it to act as a stand in for a thumb That is not an elegant solution and not a perfect one but it gets the job done Evolution is does not produce perfect solutions but tweaks here and there to get the job done THAT is how evolution operates Based in part on the fact that no tetrapods terrestrial vertebrates exist in the fossil record prior to about 370 million years ago the Theory of Evolution would predict that tetrpods evolved from fish If that were the case there should have existed at one time a fish with characteristics of both fish and tetrapods In other words a Transitional Species Until about 2005 there was little evidence for such a creature There were however a class of fish called Sarcopterygians or Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian seas What charracterized those lobe finned fishes was that those fins were supported by external bones and muscles Those bones a single bone connected to two bones conncted to smaller bones are analogous to the limb bones of all tetrapods including humans Most Sarcopterygian Fishes have long been extinct but they are survied today by two species of coelacnth and six species of lungfish Still what was missing was a fossil showing characteristics of fish AND tetrapods When Neil Shubin and his team decided to search for a fossil that filled the gap between the Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian Seas and the earliest tetrapod fossils represented by Ichtheostega and Acanthostega dated about 370 mya Since those fossils were found in geologic deposits indicating a freshwater environment and if the Theory of Evolution is correct in its hypothesis that tetrapods evolved from fish then transitional fossils should be found in similar deposits somewhat older in age The problem was that geologic deposits of that age are exposed at few places on the earths surface Fortunately a great deal of geologic exploration has been done throughout the world financed often times by oil and mining interests They selected an area in the Canadian Arctic Ellesmere Island as having the greatest likelihood of success It took 4 years of searching during the short summers of that hostile environment but succeeded returning in 2004 with 9 specimens of the fish they named Tiktaalik It was exactly what one would expect a transitional fishtetrapod to look like and was found in deposits dated 375 mya If this was not the direct ancestor of tetrapods it was something very much like itThis is a great example of using evolutionary theory as a predictive tool The genetic variation within a population is referred to as a gene pool Organisms can move freely within that population breeding with each other perpetuating any new mutations that work and eliminating those that are less than optimalEach offspring will most resemble its parents yet will vary slightly genetically because of unique mutations acquired during meiosis Thus the genetic makeup of a population will change ever so slightly with each successive generation Populations are not stable they expand and contract with changing conditions So long as there is sufficient genetic variation within a population there will be some members capable of surviving those conditions and perpetuating the species The alternative is extinction When populations expand and migrate to new territories some portions of it will become genetically isolated from each other and no longer share a common gene pool In such cases each such sub population will carry a subset of the parent population but subsequent mutations will be unique to each new population the genotype that will come to differentiate that population from others Genetic Drift To the extent that such populations encounter differing environmental conditions that environment will exert different evolutionary pressures on that population New mutations will have a much greater chance of coming to dominance within a smaller population than they would in the larger parent population where they would be one among the many Over thousands of generations genetic differences accumulate in the different gene pools making interbreeding ever more difficult until at some point speciation can be said to have occurred Because speciation is a process rather than an event it would be no more possible to pinpoint where speciation occurred than to identify where on the color spectrum orange becomes red,
Sometimes when its really quiet for a long time if theres a loud sound behind me I can feel my ear move slightly,
Excellent video thanks for posting much appreciated New sub  ,
Is that human infant gene grasping branches found in live birthed baby chameleon lizards,
so we just gone act like we aint just see a cat get crushed by a mirror,
I have the thing in the thumbnail goosebumps and I can move my left ear What about yall,
Can we have more video like this so amazing,
*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  The Predictive Ability of the Theory  Part I* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions Perhaps the greatest tests for any theory is their use as a predictive tool and the Theory of Evolution does that beautifully The first fossils were discovered quite by accident incidental to some other human activity There are still fossils discovered that way but no paleontologist will count on accidental discoveries Expeditions seeking particular fossils are planned meticulously Fifty years ago creationists could derisively point to the fact that science had no transitional whale fossils But then with the aid of geologic maps funded in part by oil and mineral companies and the Theory of Evolution predicting when in geologic time such fossils were likely to be found paleontologists were able to locate where in the world the proper marine sediments were exposed at the earths surface As each new discovery came to light they each showed a range of features from inherited to derived Each was consistent with what would be expected if the theory was correct There was no evidence of a derived feature returning to a more primitive form No derived feature occurring out of place in the geologic record When Neil Shubin and his team sought a fossil with transitional features between fish and tetrapod they knew that the earliest tetrapod fossils were found in fresh water sediments dated about 370 million years ago It was reasonable to assume that a transitional fossil if such existed would most likely be found in similar sediments somewhat older perhaps those dated at about 375 mya Geologic maps indicated that there are few places in the world where such layers are exposed at the earths surface but one they deemed to have the greatest probability of success was on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic Not exactly ones ideal summer vacation spot It took four expeditions in the very short Arctic summers but they returned in 2004 with nine fossil specimens of a fish they named Tiktaalik It was a fish but a fish like no other It had scales gills and a swimming tail but it also had lungs a sturdy rib cage and muscular fins ideal for pushing through weedy shallow marshes Those fins had the same arrangement of bones found in land based animals One bone humerus forelimb or femur hind limb Two bones ulna and radius forelimb or tibia and fibula hind limb followed by metacarpals and phalanges Even more interesting was the flattened head with eyes on top whose focus would have been at or above the waters surface and a neck that allowed it to move its head without having to move its whole body Here was a Devonian fish capable of breathing air watching at the waters surface most likely for the insects and other arthropods that millions of years earlier had followed plants in colonizing the land Recent research has revealed that eyes are very expensive tissue in terms of calorie consumption That is why cave dwelling organisms are quite often blind The limited food sources in those caves are the environmental pressure for the elimination of superfluous tissue Experiments have shown that larger eyes only marginally improve underwater vision but can increase air vision 100 fold While we cannot for certain determine the eye size of extinct organisms the size of the eye socket provides a pretty good approximation Tiktaaliks eye sockets were quite large indicating it was most likely searching for prey above the waters surface This is a fish at the margin of land and water with many features that would have suited it on land We cannot be certain that this fish or its progeny was the ancestor of all tetrapods but if not it was something very similar to it As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The Theory of Evolution pointed to where such a fossil would be found and indeed it was,
Imma let you finish but I came here just for joss fong,
That baby is a saiyan,
Woww so I guess my body hasnt evolved much cuz I can pretty much do all stuff mentioned above,
Wish humans had tails like saiyans,
You got your OPG xray upside down,
Great information thank you so much,
Its 2016 and we still feel a need to censor the human body Oi,
I have the palmaris longus on my right hand But that doesnt help me *Because Im left handed*,
So Ronand Wilkis can you explain me what are mutations and how they function,
I started getting another vain sticking out of my other hand even since i started working out thx vox you gave them another point by being physically unfit,
bro I think Im absent,
life after death is the same as life before you were born,
_Your body is a temple Dont make me knock it down_,
I love learning about evolution Btw I have the muscle,
I have ears like all living things it must true,
Yay I have that hand muscle,
hand in thumbnail shows if u possess italian heritage,
I have the palmerous longus idk how it spelt,
Maximum sunbathing might be the key for human evolution,
*looks at arm* YAY Im a mutant Now I want telepathy and an advanced healing factor,
lost it  229,
Creationist BBBUR I HAVE A BOOK,
LMFAO THAT CAT MAN RIP THAT GUY,
227 ok thanks but am I gonna fight the snowman,
Often when Im sitting quietly in my room and hear a noise behind me from someone else in the house I can feel one of my ears piviting a tiiny bit towards the soundI think its really fascinating,
I was expecting something on the appendix too a little surprised you chose to leave that one out,
I am surprised to see how many people reject evolution do you even have biology in your school What is happening We are at 21st century in a highly developed technological society and yet we dont accept a cornerstone of modern science  Evolution You dont believe in evolution its not a religion it is a process to describe life changes on Earth and proofs are everywhere look at your DNA its almost identical to other species with little tweaks here and there This is the biggest proof of evolution that you need,
I have that hand vein thing on one arm but not the other wtf,
More administer plead tvpnrq atmosphere Latin abandon prosecutor awful greatest big moon,
I got a synthial muscle in my left arm but I dont in my right arm Ha Im more special than others,
I am here for I am addicted to this channel,

RIP KITTEN hahaha evolution of the fittest,
Christians be like BLASPHEMY,
why are they blurring the toddlers genital how am i supposed to get off,
My palmaris longus doesnt come show a lot but I can still see it,
Heh Creationism or Evolutionism I believe were actually devolving and creationing,
In the Thumbnail picture my right hans cant do that but my left can,
Explain the Syrian war and can we really lick our elbows,
Im sorry that some theists are preachingbut not all of us are against evolution I believe in evolution but I also believe in God Please guys dont fight Tolerate D,

I dont have the muscle on my right hand but I have it on my left,
The hearing left or right I might possibly have it,
Science is rad Too bad the crazies will never appreciate it,
Wow reading the comment section i can realize the human stupidity has no limits,
I have one eardrum so I use the ability to move my ears a lot and it actually works woo,
ChristiansBuddhistsEct *Stop Violating me with your opinion* Edit Well the majority,
vox siding with facts and science wow,
Im both I have a long muscle in one arm none in the other,
Interesting video but after reading the comment section I feel like I lost IQ points,
That baby is gonna be rippeddoing pull ups at such a young age,
Well I believe in evolution but this video kinda unscientific,
*_Lemme just quickly Photoshop my wrists_*,
woss I read your messages sometimes partially from the notifications First you call me ignorant now you question my veracity Nice guy,
Why does this have dislikes,
Hey I have this arm bone,
What if iam able to move my own hairline with just my muscles,
Ok I love cats but I dont understand why people are so worried about a mirror falling on it They fall out of trees and 2 story buildings and live I think theyre fine if a mirror falls on them Just saying,
I have that tendon in only 1 arm,
1 Appendix vestigial organ we dont need 2 Adductor hallucis muscle in of foot Similar to the adductor pollicis and opponence pollicis muscle of the thumb great toe and thumb once had similar functions 3 Weakness of inguinal canal inguinal hernia Due to the fact that our bodies havent quite adopted to standing on two legs The more you know,
Another interesting evolutionary fact your ear bones evolved from gills,
I have it on my right but not on my left,
I can do that ear thing,
I dont have that muscle on my arm but my mom has it thanks evolution for the update,
their inner monkey,
hmm i have a vestigial muscle on my right hand but not my left,

we evolved to reject gluten or something lol humans have evolved,
*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  Vestigial Human Traits* Vestigial refers to an organ or part which is greatly reduced from the original ancestral form and is no longer functional or is of reduced or altered function They are not necessarily useless as some people assume Just as humans inherit characteristics of their nearest relatives each of us has characteristics inherited from more distant relatives In the inner corners of your eyes you have what is called a semilunar fold or plica semilunaris There is a muscle attached to it but it doesnt do anything in humans In many other animals sharks frogs birds your cat however that muscle controls a transparent nictitating membrane or third eyelid that can be drawn over the eye Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic You also have three sets of muscles attached to your ears In other animals those muscles turn the ears to focus on the direction of a sound This ability is found in monkeys most of which cannot turn their head horizontally Humans and the other apes can turn their heads vertically and the ability to move the ears is largely lost in those species Using sensitive electronic devices researches find that the human brain is still sending nerve impulses to those muscles in response to sounds but the most any human can do is a bit of a wiggle Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic Then there is the Plantaris Muscle which in other primates facilitates arboreal lifestyle allowing the feet to function much the same as hands in gripping branches The human foot has lost this ability rather early on it seems in the process of becoming bipedal The muscle however is still there It is a long pencil thin muscle and tendons running down the back of the calf that are extremely painful when ruptured and often misdiagnosed as a more serious injury This injury often called Tennis Leg occurs most frequently in athletes over 40 due to the tendon and attachments becoming more brittle With or without treatment the two ends of the rupture will shrivel and disappear within weeks with no loss of function in the leg It is indeed one of evolutions leftovers It is often harvested for reconstructive surgery elsewhere in the body That these muscles are still present in the human body indicates that the genetic instructions for them are still present in the human genome and active to some extent At some point the genes for these traits may be silenced by a mutation that disables a gene such as a premature STOP codon or frame shift making them a pseudo gene one which no longer produces a protein There is evidence that is already happening as this muscle is absent in one leg or both in about 10 of the population The same seems to be happening with wisdom teeth In the wild primate infants are capable of grasping and holding on to the mothers fur shortly after birth allowing the mother to pursue other activities Human infants because of the limited birth canal and large human brain must enter this world at a much earlier stage of physical and neuronal development Despite that the developing human embryo exhibits a grasping reflex in the uterus as early as 16 weeks Even at birth that reflex the Palmar Grip Reflex is incredibly strong as most parents of newborns will attest While it is capable of supporting the childs weight one must exercise caution as the child may suddenly let go This reflex may persist up to 6 months after birth As this is of no benefit to a human child it is vestigial All Great Apes including humans have an appendix In other apes the appendix is quite large and a repository for bacteria which help to digest the leaves that make up a large part of their diet In humans it is called the vermiform worm shaped appendix and is minuscule While some hypothesize that our appendix is a repository for good bacteria to replenish out gut biota following diarrhea the fact is that a hot appendix can kill you whereas those who have had it removed go on to lead normal lives The vomeronasal organ VNO is an organ located at the base of the dividing wall between right and left nostrils nasal septum It is present in most amphibia reptiles and mammals but absent in birds and adult Old World catarrhine monkeys which include apes and humans It enables the detection of pheromones via pheromone receptor VR genes that produce proteins sensitive to certain biochemical signals The VNO is clearly present in the human fetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults and is thus vestigial The VR genes plentiful in other species while present in the human genome are all or almost all disabled by mutations making them pseudogenes again vestigial remnants Pseudogenes are vestiges of previously active genes that have been disabled by some mutation and no longer produce a protein There are some 20000 of them n the human genome many of them remnants of Olfactory Receptor scent receptor genes While humans have lost an additional 30 of these genes since our ancestral lineage separated from that of chimps most of those pseudogenes are handmedowns from even more remote relatives but disabled by exactly the same mutations again evidence of common ancestry We see vestigial structures all through nature They remain in some cases because they have been adapted for other purposes in others they remain simply because there has been no evolutionary advantage to eliminating them They certainly do not support the idea of intelligent design They are however completely consistent with the Theory of Evolution,
I only have 1 on 1 arm,
Poor cat,
I am always saddened by the comments on these type of videos,
Left arm has this vestigeal muscle Right arm doesnt ,
awee when the cat got squashed bu the mirror,
Genuinely good evidence for macro evolution,
Not knowing the purpose doesnt mean there is no purpose A better question is how by chance all this intelligence existed,
Nno You guys are wrong This is  ALL WRONG We didnt evolve from Apes crocodiles or fish no no NO We evolved from Adam  Eve The earth is FLAT The moon is made of CHEESE and DrPhil is a REAL DOCTOR GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT,
Folks Catholic church does not deny evolution these days the concepts of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ are discussed like never before Church has already taken a complimentary stand,
Wait I can move my ears What,
 Andrew animations I lost the thread again lol Im hopeless Well yessirree you have me quoting the bible This will be good for your attention to detail,
that was all great till we had cold temperatures should be low temperatures,
DO NOT scroll down if you value your sanity I beg you,
Cant believe I got to this video by typing we dont draw on our bodies,
So a group of the earliest hunter gatherers were standing at the mouth of a cave watching a heavy thunderstorm Lightening struck a nearby tree and all but one man scrambled for shelter deeper into the cave Uhhg was a tad less frightened he had seen lightening strikes before In fact Uhhg approached the tree and picked up a branch that was aflame Soon the others found their courage and gathered around Uhhg They were praising the obvious courage he had displayed in not running for his life Uhhg was a smart feller He said that a voice had commanded him to remain when the others fled The voice told him that the fire was heaven sent and as long as it burnt Uhhgs people would prosper Uhhg said the voice had instructed him to keep the holy fire burning The voice also said the men would go on a hunt and that hunt would be successful The best of the meat was to be given to Uhhg to make an offering to the voice that only he could hear The men gathered wood for the holy fire They went on the hunt and left Uhhg to commune with the voice Thus was born religion As societies evolved so did religion Christians laugh at ancient Greek and Roman religions and insist they were based on myths Yet Christian beliefs hang upon a talking serpent a talking burning bush and a boat that held two of every species Religion was conceived to control the masses Nothing has changed except the numbers involved It is still all about wealth and power,
i am very hairy so i guess goosebumps actually r useful to me XD,
Oh yay I have my palmaris longus tendons so Im more monkey than some people,

oof that cat video tho,
just so you know if you ever need salt just go to this comment section,
159 looks like bella hadid,
Evolution truly is fascinating,
A cat was hurt in the making of this video,
I have always thought it was funny how babys can grip so strong,
*grabs popcorn and heads over to the comments section*,
I can imagine a prehistorical mother forbidding her child to move its ears considering it rude We arent animals she would say Well thank you prehistorical mother,
EVOLUTION,
Welp i guess i have one on each arm,
LAURIE WAS BORN WITH A TAIL,
Half of the comments are triggered Christians Nice,
Neh im just thicc so its visible,
OMG IS THE KITTY OKAY,
I remember when Eyes evolved into eyes tough times,
I have that thing in both arms,
Is it only me who moves their ears back when they hear an odd sound,
Bulatus I venture to guess e coli in reference to your common ancestry commentLol Again great job on initiating this conversation,
Palmar Grasp Relflex I still do this with my hand and feet Am I still a monkey,
*NOT*,
How does Evolution through natural selection explain fruits Why how and what is the story *not a joke but Im curious,
I laughed when the cat got smacked by the mirror,
Lady speaker is so my type hmu,
Well the last video reminded me of my sister When she was a baby she liked to grab anything in her reach One day my mum carried her in the yard and suddenly she grabbed the rackrod for laundry AND SHE DIDNT WANT TO LET GO Because its tiring to pull her my mum just let her go And incredibly she managed to hang on for a while until she cried,
the presenter is HOT all over,
Evolution is false video games prove that we spawned into existance change my mind,
gotta confuse our ancestors right babe,
Why did you say temple if your very stance is no god,
no one is gonna mention that we have some saiyans being born on earth with tails dont let them look at the moon lol,
Wow That narrator is hot,
All these examples are about losing information not gaining Therefor its no evidence our ancesters were another species,
I got all of them,
I am suprised seeing the cat got hit by the mirror hahahahahaa,
Does anyone remember that Taehyungs ears move on their own,
Did the cat die,
I like have one mussel on one of my hands,
Humans are apes,
Are people more prone to tennis elbow or golfers elbow or other injuries if they have the palmaris longus tendon,
i love it when joss fong commentate,
You all religious nuts really need to open a biology book for once in your life Ghh religions still the main ballast of humanity In bloody 2016,
So is Lucy the answer I dont think so,
So is it just the creationists that gave this a thumbs down,
Evolution is factual but there has never been proof of change of kind a bird might Grow a bigger beak but its still a bird,
I dont have palmaris longus what does that mean,
I think all Italians know then if they have *Palmaris longus*,
I can wiggle my two ears ,
Im just going to leave this here The definition of Science The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment,
SoI have all of those features in spades I dont think Im proud of this,
Idk if its because Im slightly fat or what but I cant see that tendon,
Puffy pigeon has made my day,
029 I can do both and I have the muscles in the middle,
Who needs to go on a foreign mission when you can just go on youtube,
May I just comment that its fantastic that so many of us agree to disagree I toast a salud health to all,
i want a tail,
321 has Goku finally arrived,
Who else did test his hand for polmaris longus ,
I just thought palmaris longus randomly and then I open YouTube and see this video,
030 when I put my hand like that it doesnt show but when I use force it does a little,
My original post seems to have been taken down for some reason who removes a post promoting peace Heres a repost I think some things should be cleared up Firstly evolution is not we evolved from apes That makes no sense and has no evidence Evolution of humans is to say that we evolved from an ancestor in common with apes over a very long period of time millions and millions of years In other words that common ancestor was one we had a very long time ago and not a species that is alive today and can be identified Also people often inaccurately characterize a theory as an idea that hasnt been proven yet which is also false A scientific theory is an explanation for something a scientific law which is what people assume to be a proven theory is a description of something we observe But people will believe what they believe by heart or mind by tradition or simply by the enormous number of world influences which have led us to stick to stable and unvarying opinions Ultimately all that matters is that we can agree to live by good moral principles and with common purpose So when atheists in this comments section for example tell theists to kill themselves they arent doing much good to justify their beliefs Or conversely when theists tell atheists they are superior to all other life and that atheists will suffer the wrath of God clearly they do not fully comprehend the advocacy for love and forgiveness by their own faith I implore both atheists and theists to leave an open mind to the others perspective because really we cannot yet prove who is correct on the creation of the universe beyond minor evidence and faith though it is a goal of humanity to solve this impossible question eventually To finish with a quote by Marcus Aurelius Live a good life If there are Gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by If there are Gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them If there are no Gods then you will be gone but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and I might add it is not divisiveness but togetherness which will in the end determine exactly how the human race perseveres and what direction we take in our final departure away from the pale blue dot Live with happiness and magnanimity overcome your red sorrows and embrace others even those you would otherwise consider to be enemies Then it does not matter who is right or wrong we will have transcended the greatest of moral barriers Ssschah,
When the mirror fell on that cat,
can anybody else move their ear or is it just me,
I have these lol no wonder I can climb so well and move my ears to nosie,
why does my right wrist have that muscle and my left arm does not have one,
OMG POOR CAT,
Ken Ham doesnt approve this video In the of jesus vanish,
So the tendon thing only shows up for me a little,
There are no visigal orgins are parts of are body this argument was debunked in the 1950s,
Whos the girl speaking,
so with a bit of bio hacking i could be a pony cool,
I can move me ear after watching my friend doing it and my other friend also can move his ear after watching me doing it Can somebody explain how this works,
woss OMG of course question about my neandrathal friend was a joke I think your skins on too tight my friend,
I can do all of these and i can move my ears too x3 i also climb walls in my housemaybe leaving a few holes,
Some Humans can evenextend and retract Their Bone Spurs for the Draft Board,
Oh man the comments section is a warfare Come with me I have cookies,
From the time of first YouTube video Comment section is going through evolution process I can see it,
But I cant see it actually change so that means it doesnt exist Anti evolutionists,
This narrators voice is soooo monotone,
230 awwww poor kitty,
I have had times where I felt my ears move on its own in response to listening or locating a noise,
for the first one i have those thing on both of my arms,
My ears sometimes lift up when I hear sudden noise that weird,
girl at 200 and 330  smokin hot,
One more example Brains flatearthers westboro baptist church members and these so called femenist not all the ones like the redhead They dont need it or use it but why do they have a brain,
Evolution is impsssble the bible saysdf sow Because people are slow on the internet this comment is a joke,
That baby was creepy at the end,
Ive Got Both Of Them,
Omg the mirror crushed the cat,
I have Palmaris longus only in the left had What,
Look at bacteria and virus you can observe evolution in your own lifetime,
Not it at allmaybe in a psiquiatric ward,
158 Awww damn Goosebumps,
257 the alligator tail has eyes,
like how water evolves when its too cold or too hot or cold food when put in the microwave evolves into hot food,
232 poor kitty XD AHAHHAHAH,
Pheobe should watch this video,
I can wiggle my ears ,
*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  Evolution Makes Testable Predictions* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions In the 1950s when it was discovered that humans had 23 pairs of chromosomes one from each parent whereas the other great apes chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans had 24 pairs creationists were ecstatic thinking they finally had evidence to counter common ancestry Chromosomes are packages of DNA that form during mitosis and meiosisThere are two sets one inherited from each parent Other Great Apes have 48 chromosomes 24 pairs 1n24 2n48 whereas humans have 46 chromosomes 23 pairs 1n23 2n46 Evolution made a testable prediction That somewhere in the human genome we should find evidence of cromosomal fusion In other words we should be able to find a human chromosome with the remnants of extra telomeres and centomeres Since the loss of all the genes in a chromosome would have been fatal to any species scientists reasoned that IF the Theory of Evolution was correct about common ancestry one of two things must have occurred Either two chromosomes had fused in humans evolutionary past OR chromosomes had split in the other apes Using Occams Razor or the law of parsimony which states that among competing hypotheses the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected Simply put it means that the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one the most likely event was chromosome fusion in humans Normal chromosomes have a centromere and ends capped with telomeres It was reasoned that IF two chromosomes had fused evidence for such an event would be found in a chromosome with two centromeres and teleomeres where they did not belong That is exactly what was found in human chromosome 2 chromosomes are numbered by length It was subsequently discovered that chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 for comparative purposes designated as 2A and 2B or 2p and 2q contained the same genes as human chromosome 2 and if placed end to end the positions of those genes matched those of the human chromosome Those chromosomes in the other apes also lined up in a similar fashion The fusion event has been confirmed In just the last few years science has gained largely complete genomes of two other human species those of Neanderthal and Denisovans We see that same chromosome fusion in their genomes as well indication that the fusion event took place in a common ancestor As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The greatest test of ANY scientific theory is in its usefulness as a predictive tool In this case as with others the Theory of Evolution has performed beautifully,
Theres WAY too much stupid to tackle in this comment section Shout out to Gary Bell and Woss At for wasting their time trying though Lmao,
I can wiggle my ears,
I can move my ears and the whole top of my head what does this mean,
Now I know why brother has a tail,
231 Mirror Evolved,
Santa is more realer than Evolution Evolution isnt even a person,
wowwww that made me moreee religious Now i get to knw how perfectly we are made by our Creator,
That goose tho 3,
the cat ,
I am a supah Saiyanjin,
15500 creationist are unhappy about this video,
freedom of speech,
Evolution is a highly intelligent inventor and can engineer all types complex sentient creatures with emotions and goals and makes ecosystems that are razor sharp precise to sustain the living things it even updates and makes modifications to a species that is struggling or kills off failed inventions and prototypes therefore lets all Praise the all powerful planner and builder evolution and may it bless me and my offspring with many useful mutations death to uneducated non believers they will all be extinct,
How does evolution work Nobody has explained that yet Is it just a random mutation and then that one being becomes the fittest to survive and thrive past the previous version,
*Italiano muscles*,
I actually didnt expect to see so many people in the comments deny evolution,
041 i still have it xdd,
I dont have the muscle,
Evidence of the same creator,
ahh i remember this from highschool,
All you evolution deniers can stay stuck in the 14th Century if you want but please dont brainwash your kids They will just be laughed at in Biology class,
Thumbnail shows just two italian hands no present no absent,
030 I dont have those on my arm ,
Can you bend your thumbs backwards Only one of mine can,
that host is so goddamn beautiful,
320 thats not a human thats a saiyan,
Vox should create a video on how sound affects a person watching a video or news report and how it stimulates the brain,
voxnot voicefoxantichrists tool over youtube christians beware,
This is fantastic information showing the evidence of evolution But why does this imperfection in us negate God and His greatnessIt is His will which is supreme and He Does as He PleasesWhat do you folks think,
Before posting a comment know that the word theory isnt the same as hypothesis,
Hey can you explain that can we a baby fetus looking at space,
I only have a Palmaris longus on my right arm oof,
25K angry Ken Hams disliked,
231 Mirrors evolved to defend themselves from kittens,
Water also evolves into gas or ice,
I dont have to polmoros longos or whatever it is in my arm,
340 why does the 1930s footage look creepy and yellow Like some Area 51 experiments,
Who loves being evolved,
Its missing on my two arms _,
Whats the name of the girl I need it for a science project,
Arabic caption for Odins sake,
I missing it in my left arm,
Palmar test obese people cant relate,
I laughed so hard at 233 LMAO,
how many sharks have to die before yall realize that maybe the best place for them is in their natural habitat,
Sleep deprivation is why the sharks are dying sharks sleep while still swimming its hard to do that in a circular glass tank Hence the bumping into the glass and the sores,
Heres an idea why not keep em in the biggest tank whats it called oh yeah THE OCEAN,
Just let them free no one wants to be in captivity,
Took in I think you mean kidnapped,
If I was in captivity Id lose the will to live too,
Human 1 *Puts shark in tank* Shark 1 *Dies* Human HMMMMMMMM *Puts shark 2 in bigger tank* Shark 2 *Dies* Human 2 What if we get a smaller one so it wont die as quickly Human 1 Sounds humane enough,
This is sick letting sharks die just to test out how to keep them in tanks for our viewing Even though they are scary doesnt mean they deserve this,
Goodness cant humans just keep them were they belong Sharks arent meant for show viewing and being kept in aquariums,
Imagine some other lifeform accidently catching us in their fishnet and then be like hey since youre allready in a net why not put you in a glass box for all the others to look at And if you die after some days its okey cause there are plenty of more humans to collect and to be put inside this great box I dont get why its different just because its a shark Poor creatures they need to be free not put on display for us humans,
almost like they arent meant to be in captivity,
Imagine someone took us from our home and put us in a box where animals would watch us ,
036 But arent we all in the process of dying With some taking loner than others,
Puts human in cage  Dies Puts human in slightly bigger cage  dies Puts baby in cage  dies Sharks hmm why are they dying,
Heres an idea How about you leave the great white sharks in the ocean and figure out a way of removing that floating island of plastic pollution That I would give money too,
We dont need bring these animals to us we need to go them create an underwater observatory directly in their natural habitat so that we can observe them without obstructing their lives,
What is it with this obsession with capturing animals just think about it what kind of sick twisted minds do we have,
So they stopped trying to capture sharks because its resource extensive I really expected them to say that they dont want any more sharks to die because of these attempts but they just care about the resources Pathetic,
That awesome animal died in just 3 days such a shame and waste,
I hate to see highly intelligent creatures in captivity A crab would eat its mother and doesnt care about anything as long as its kept well fed but highly intelligent and social animals in captivity break my heart Sea mammals dolphins for instance social and affectionate creatures used for entertainment purposes so that people can interact with them and take cute pictures that has to stop,
It wouldnt be surprising if they died of boredom considering how far the travel In the Ocean,
How is this justified,
mmh it seems like the sharks are dying if we catch them  LETS TRY AGAIN,
An adult male Orca is 5 times the size mass of a great white but can adapt to those paddle pools they put them in The instinctive shark can last 3 to 6 months but the adaptive Orca 20  30 years Those poor sharks keep bumping their nose until they die On the other hand the Orca indures 30 years of prison In its body and its mind There is a lot of crap out there from SeaWorld saying we care for our animals Im sure they do Buy key thing is  instinctive fish or adaptive whale evolution has produced two fine specimens that deserve to roam Why because that is how they evolved Like the dudes post before me get in a boat and go see them in the wild And if you cant afford that go to Imax And if thats not good enough Ask someone who knows about these animals and where they are Aussie SA USA NZ Canada Sri Lanka India I could keep going with the right guide u can see these animals anywhere,
ITS REALLY SIMPLE LEAVE THEM ALONE all living things deserve the right to be FREE not held behind glass for our own amusement which is usually why they are captured,
This is the first time I actually felt sorrow for a deadly shark Holding any animal outside their natural habitat is punishment,
Sharks and whales dont belong in tiny aquariums,
just stop catching them smh,
Eureka I have solve this issue Ready to hear it Vox Okay here it goes LEAVE THEM ALONE,
Me 20 years later And kids this is how the great whit shark went extinct,
So lets not put them in tanks Problem solved,
imprisoning living things for human entertainment is wrong on so many levels,
Yay Monterey bay aquarium I live in that area Woo Santa Cruz,
Consumers wanted to see a goliath You all knew that but killed many to settle for a 4 ft baby Wow,
Lets put humans in a cage and aquarium See how they feel Most belong in a zoo anyway,
A bit cruel aye,
When they released the shark it was still swimming in circles It probably forgot how to hunt and feed itself and mostly just swam in circles slowly dying Not cool tanking open ocean sharks is cruelty,
So sad  I really do hope theyre done trying to contain greatness,
How many people here complaining about the mistreatment of sharks are fine with cows being imprisoned and slaughtered because the dead cows taste is pleasing to them,
Lets say the truth here stress kills the sharks mentally,
*see title Me 2 words well tencicly 1 word and 1 letter NVM 2 words *JAWS 3*,
Keep them stay in the ocean,
Obligatory she C H O N K,
When they showed the pic of the sharks injured nose ,
Heres an idea Just leave them where they are and bring people to them,
Lady at the end was type cute,
Poor creatures it is so cruel to keep a beautiful fierce wild creature in a tank trapped alone and dying,
Im so glad that every one of these comments express outraged over this video Still Hope for humanity,
this made me so angry leave the sharks alone,
So basically they die from depression,
good stop f***in around with sharks you damn hoomans,
Ohhh well i have a great idea Why wont we store the sharks on their NATURAL HABITAT In the ocean,
I live 10 minutes away from the Monterey Bay Aquarium And I didnt know that,
The aquarium cannot contain its greatbess coz its great af,
Put some of my syrup in their water supply always makes me feel alive,
I think they should make a circle but the inside of the circle the people can see the shark Because a shark always has to move and a hollow circle can be great for always moving,
These aquarium people should be kept in captivity then only they will understand what its like to be in captivity Idiots,
The fact that it took multiple deaths for them to PROVE you could do it Absurd and disgusting,
Soul link,
Well need a bigger tank That tank is the ocean,
What would would we do without Vox,
It is impossible to keep a great white in captivity because of the sharks size and the fact they must keep moving due to their size and the way they sleep when they sleep its gliding through the water towards the bottom at an angle these sharks can grow to 23ft in length and the girth on these animals is phenomenal they may last in captivity anywhere from 35 days depending on the size and depth of aquarium these animals must remain in the open ocean to live not in a aquarium where their lifespan will be cut short these are magnificent animals and we can appreciate them better by leaving them where they are free in the ocean,
The plot to the meg looks so overly dramatic now A tank coulda solved everything,
those poor fish dying for nothing,
Wht about rosie the great white who was abandoned due to bankrupcy on Australia,
Hey heres an idea for aquariums dont hold wild animals captive,
I think theyre dying in fish tank because of lack of oxygen People need to change the water every hour and feed them every hour,
A relationship is like a shark it needs to keep moving forward or it dies And darling Im afraid what we have here is a dead shark Annie Hall,
Aquariums are disgustingly cruel on all species trapped there,
Answer DANGEROUS,
Fricken SeaWorld stop leave it alone,
Just leave them alone Never understood why youd want to hold one captive,
Vox you guys are a global youtube channel Isnt it time to start using metric system in your videos,
*systematic logical sequence of things*,
Pfft in Australia we dont need an aquarium We see them in beaches too often,
Voz could please use metrical system as well Thank you,
This is considered animal abuse,
Maybe its because they are supposed to live in the ocean,
Somehow the Thumbnail reminds me at SUPERORGANISM,
I hope every ppl that would try to store shark in an aquarium would be eaten by them,
Aquariums shoulnd even exist,
build a 3D torus tank it is boundaryless but finite in volume problem solved,
fake news what really happens is that the sharks fake their death and escape to Cuba,
Baby shark dodo dodo dodo,
So youre telling me that Dr Evils sharks were not real,
Guess im gonna be the first after a long time,
Its so intriguing how Sharks resist captivity,
scientists if you put sharks in aquariums they will die just dont do it sea world hold my beer,
Death is better than Bondage  Michael B Jordan,
I like how the comments are with sharks,
I know its offtopic but Dion is such a wonderful woman,

sooo not so great orcas are great,
theres White shark in Manila Ocean park,
why not just leave them alone ,
The guy sounds like Stephen hawking,
Wooooo Monterey Bay Aquarium coming in for the win for aquatic wildlife,
The video doesnt actually answer its own title statement It only states that the sharks die Although I hate the idea of a magnificent animal like this dying especially at the hands of man that almost seems preferable than to have more and more White Sharks being captured and put in captivity just for them to be a moneyspinning tourist attraction,
This is just the folly of human hubris Mother nature Hey so this shark is such a way that it needs to constantly roam long distances to stay healthy and productive Humanity Yeah but i want it in a tank comparable to an Olympic sized swimming pool Kids want to look at it Mother nature Well Im sorry but thats just not how things have worked out Humanity Yeah but I want it,
Great white *gets captured* I guess Ill just die instead,
We cant have a goblin shark in a tank,
Quick explanation They die just simply die,
We can say stop killing the sharks how ever long we want or protect our planet but deep down you know we would protest if Zoos or aquarium would be taken away Im just saying,
Thanks for the recommendation Nappy,
To sum up this video Humans take nature out of nature Nature dies Humans are baffledSo they keep trying,
seems like the sharks prefer death over bondage,
make a law for prohibated aquariums to not catch them and use as a income source,
with the oceans becoming warmer and quickly becoming more acidic we may one day only have captive sharks left,
thats crazy i was there and saw that baby white and thought to myself wow they really have a great white i was in six grade and we had a fieldtrip glad i went,
In Soviet Russia you dont cage sharks sharks cage you,
And of course DO NOT PUT MEGALODONS IN AQUARIUMS,
yo why do people get excited seeing a mf shark in a tank wtf,
I love how everyone in the comments is hating on the aquariums,
Humankind right here Lets take shark from their natural environment and put them in an aquarium To make benefits out of it of course,
Or you know you could just leave the sharks alone and not interfere,
for biodiversity like this video amazing illustrations wow,
This is why jet skis in gta 5 called seashark Not aquarium shark,
The most destructive and invasive animal on Earth is the human,
I want megalodon,
Lets kill more sharks so we can figure out how to keep them alive Great idea,
Why should you all bring the shark to the aquarium They belong to the nature Just keep them in their place,
Maybe they could make the aquarium a oneway mirror That way the shark would see its own reflection and stay away from the walls,
Actually theres this one place where I know we could safely fit thousands of sharks Its called the ocean Crazy right,
What a great video Perfectly segmented articulately formatted and time efficient Subbbbb,
WHY why why We do NOT need Great Whites in captivity if you wish to see them go see them in their natural habitat if you dare and they arent 20 long Humans are always interfering with Mother Nature and it is usually to the detriment of the species and often humans as well,
Why we shouldnt have orcas in aquariums too,
Sharks belong to the ocean you cant keep them in aquarium,
You Wasted Millions Just to Stare at a Fish  And it Still Died,
Wowgood facts im showing my friends this vid,
This was the first YouTube video to address this topic Many lame Johnny Come Lately videos on the same topic have followed,
When are humans going to learn that no matter what they build or create its never going to be a good idea to take a wild creature out of their natural environment Just leave em be thats all you greedy souls have to do It requires zero effort but we simply have to try to control dominate and profit off of everything and anything Greed and stupidity will end humanity sooner than we expect  Stephen Hawking,
The sharks lived in the massive ocean then they are put into a tank that is so much smaller than the ocean,
Why cant we just leave them in the ocean,
Im not sure but Im from Germany and I found 3 videos with the same name but in German,
One like Is 1 shark being saved from captivity,
This really begs the question Why Keep Trying,
Create more accessible Scuba diving possibilities,
i think we should just leave them in the ocean,
aquariums and zoos both shouldnt exist,
Monterey bay aquarium best of the best,
Eggshaped tanks Thats a cylinder What you are showing is a cylinder Where the heck are you buying your eggs Vox,
When I was a kid my family were going to an acuarium with sharks and I was very exited because I though there would be a great white shark but there wasnt and I got sad,
me and sharks have an agreement they stay out of my home I stay out of theirs its been working so far lol,
To hell with all these aquariums Thanks for the story,
Sea world Getting great white sharks into our locations is very hard and difficult and they wont last very long so for those reasons Im out,
Open ocean fish Key word there OPEN,
isnt the titel of the video wrong if there is an aquarium who hashad them,
100 i thought the video ended who else thought that,
Bigger Sharks follow open ocean Current lines They the worlds great travels These scientist are really dumb,
Just leave the damn sharks alone,

heres the solution make a robot shark boom instant increase in aquarium visitors,
Porque* e no por que no ttulo da verso em portugus,
Lets put aquarium executives in confinement and see how long they last,
Next stop Megalodon in an aquarium,
I believe in order for them to contain sharks is to literally remake the ocean in a aquarium with a wave maker and flow aswell as using the same water it was taken from,
Some ppl You should maybe leave sharks alone in their natural habitat and if you intend on studying one go observe it it in its natural habitat Other ppl But what about the kids THEY WANNA SEE REAL SHARKS Listen I wanna go out and see space but you dont see me complaining There are literally thousands of other sea creatures to see Seaworld reportedly has 24000 fish BORN throughout their parks And thats just the amount born Seriously Just go take your kids to look at the dolphins or something And if you wanna say THEY HAVE TO SEE A SHARK Most aquatic parks have other sharks to view Seriously Your kids will be fine they dont have to see one specific shark to grow up as a healthy adult,
Aquarium are just so evil Why cant they just limit themselfs on the things where they are actually usefull and not on the things where they are a part of the problem,
LEAVE THE SHARKS ALONE DAMMIT,
This video is false In San Diego they have several Great White Sharks on display,
*baby shark doo doo doo doo doo* 3x *baby shark*,
so in the end the problem was they tried to keep a Pelagic shark shark that roam in the open ocean in a tank,
Humans the only species who feel entitled to put other speciesfellow humans in cages for whatever the reason,
No aquarium should have great whites They scare me enough as is when theyre in the ocean and Im not I dont need them to be in a tank when I go to see nemo,
If you put a human in captivity We get depressed just the same with animals No wonder they died,
You cannot contain greatness,
Stop capturing marine wildlife They do not belong in tanks,
miami seaquarium has several,
Very well researched video Really enjoyed watching it Nice one,
stupid researchersrip to those sharks who lost their life on the name of science,
why do you need a shark leave it be,
I saw both of those sharks it was amazing,
The shark has crippling depression and they will not eat dead fish they like to hunt they only eat dead things if they are despret,
comment section HERP DE DERP PETA WAS RIGHT SHARKS DONT DESERVE THIS LETS KEEP THEM IN THE WILD UWU YEET Sharks are already in danger To keep them alive we need to breed them in captivity How do we breed them in captivity you ask We need to find out how to keep them in captivity without them killing themselves within a few days How do we do that you ask HMM MAYBE WE SHOULD TEST IT OUT Scientists test it out unfortunately a few sharks die because THAT IS THE PROCESS OF LEARNING HOW TO KEEP AN ANIMAL IN CAPTIVITY WE ARENT PERFECT INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A CONFIRMED METHOD You scream OH MY GOD IM SMARTER THAN THEM LETS JUST KEEP THEM IN THE OCEAN SO THEY DIE IN THE WILD I tell you this You scream OH MY GOD JUST TEACH HUMANS TO BE BETTER THEN Humans have free will They wont change from being evil Evil is something that has been in our world forever We cant control people You just need to accept that TLDR Sharks are in danger we need to learn how to breed them in captivity We need to learn how to keep them in captivity and make mistakes We cant teach humans to be better people and we need to focus on having the good people learn to save the sharks in captivity instead of leave them to die in the wild,
Let the sharks life there live If people want to see a shark they could watch jaws or something like that,
Wow its almost like this animal shouldnt be in captivity Who wouldve though,
Then explain vector from dispicable me and his mega shark pit,
Why not bring the aquarium to the sharks instead of shraks to aquariums,
The Monterey Bay aquarium is amazing I recommend if you are in the Santa Cruz area then go on over to the aquarium it is worth the time,
Determination lend cattle xntubm pull muscle full explain relation anyway,
its simple why they run into walls they are asleep and running into a wall every 5 minutes while asleep could rlly f*ck with your head and they possibly could be dying from lack of sleep,
If it doesnt work IT DOESNT WORK LEAVE THE SHARKS ALONE FOR PROFIT ,
I believe that they still doin the research till now Feel sad for those shark Leave them alone,
And thats why I agree with Anthony Jeselnik I get so happy when sharks kill people,
You guys all think this is bad when 12000 sharks are finned and die slowly every hour,
I read the title and remembered seeing great white sharks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium one time we visited and the vid mentioned it within the first minute and I was like oh I was right,
404 According to the map the Great White Shark swam 80KM across dry land yet aquariums cant keep them alive in a tank go figure,
The Turkish word for shark literally can be translated as dog fish,
tone conference dance expose remarkable themselves person four reflection contact,
never noticed they didnt have white sharks in aquariums i didnt really acknowledge it now that this video randomly shows up in my recommendations im suddenly interested,
This not accurate as Cape Town Aquarium is home too a number of Great white sharks,
035 jesus christ vox has hte most unbearable narrators and thats saying something for youtube,
Its to do with the sharks Sonar sensors etc They just dont like it,
why even keep them in aquariumscaptivity it doesnt benefit them at all and theres no reason to do it let them live their lives in full in the beautiful ocean,
this prove that shark are smart they properly bored to death,
Monterey Bay Aquarium Caf Introducing the all new Great White Shark Sandwich Available only while supplies last,
You should do a story on why the state will give me a fine if I try to keep a great white shark,
35 feet ,
I was there when Monterey Bay Aquarium had the great white,
Anyone else feel bad for the shark,
The only Good SHark is a Dead Shark Period,
Ethics No Well alright then,
How aboutleaving them alone,
This makes me so sad Just let the sharks live in the ocean instead of risking their lives showing them to people,
Dont great whites travel in almost straight lines while almost asleep so maybe they bump in the tan because they are trying to do that and so barely sleep and then die,
Dude sounds like Microsoft Sam 108,
I saw the Great White at Steinhart Really something to see The tank they had it in was called The Roundabout a circular tank actually a circle within a circle where the shark could just swim and never run into a wall like swimming in a giant buntcake pan I dont know how long it was there buy not very long I was glad to have gotten the chance to see it,
Hey I live by the Monterey bay aquarium,
Freedom fighters,
How about just leaving them alone Just my two cents,
thanks for the interesting information lets leave these amazing creature in mother ocean were they belong and take the time to see them in their environment and protect that environment,
Sounds way too complicated Lets just let them be,
Just seeing a picture of this shark seriously unnerves me,
I doubt that shark can be domesticated ever,
As much as I would love to see a great white shark I would never threaten its life just to see it ,
I am happy with an aquarium with no sharks just keep them in the wild I dont care,
Give me liberty or give me death  says the shark probably,
Just leave the sharks alonegeez,
Replicating nature is imposible,
Its almost like the Sharks dont belong in cages,
Jesus Leave them alone ,
Those beasts cannot be tamed WAAAY to OP with no intentions of being nerfed,
Zoos and Aquariums are cruel and must be shutdown,
No living thing should be in a fn cage,
Thats so so sad They all belong in their natural homes not tanks,
The Great White It bravely hunts alone and would rather be dead then captured more honor than those vile zerging cry baby Orcas,
It dies short after it was released well of course not being sure why is just lazy captivity kills,
You didnt actually say why The answer is sharks use echolocation In an aquarium setting where people are often bumping into or tapping the glass is disrupts the sharks ability to use echolocation and they run into the glass or get confused Basically they starve or just injure themselves and die,
Stop kidnapping living beings and taking them to their death for your amusement Theyre not playthings,
If they die being in captivity than why continue to try it Theres no reason to have them in the first place,
notice electric trail yet function road English nowhere district publicly,
Damn guys just chill You dont HAVE to capture every animal,
Tbh the only actual acceptable reason to keep these things in captivity is for research and other scientific examination,
Its simple Great Whites are predators not entertainers,
My question is why I dont understand the desperate need to capture something to display it,
At 130 wait im about 10 mins away from there and ive been there and seen the shark,
Ive seen the great white in the Monterey Bay Aquarium in 2011 That was the first time I saw a great white,
Nah Orca always the king of predator,
why did this video make me feel sad for sharks,
It doesnt work just stop,
Buwahahaaa its simple why  Omg educate yourself vox  Great whites are connected to the natural magnetic field of the earth When it goes into captivity the mag field is lost ,
Didnt know about this Thanks though,
yeah i have been wondering why,
What is the music used,
we are going to need a bigger tank,
Not only those sharks you only see At old hongkong ocean land there is a hammerhead sharks and its real I was there at old honkong and there is also land living animals,
I think sharks need Megalodon now,
Just leave the damn things in the wild how would you feel if a team of sharks walked on land and took you captive in their habitat,
I just want some sharks with fricken lazer beams attached to their heads,
how bout they leave them tf alone,
toy pretty exactly umtqy poem former correct change interest interrupt,
I saw the great white shark at the Monterey Bay Aquarium So amazing It commanded respect So beautiful,
if many other aquatic museums followed ethic customs such as these then there wouldnt be as many issues,
As an alien from Fornax VII weve had similar problems maintaining humans in tanks They die after a couple of weeks even after we added Axe Body Lotion to their water supply They stop eating and breathing so quickly We mixed fertilizer into their diets and kept their nail beds at 400 hundred degrees but nothing works Eventually with enough research we should be able to display a juvenile for more than a year,
May be they r smart n proud They suicide in captivity,
To the people saying this is horrible Im sorry but its human nature to gain a profit from something It probably wont change,
More people die of vending machines than shark attacks,
**At **213**Sharks are **NOT** fish** True enough they have gillstructures similar to fish and they are aquatic but thats where it all ends**,
LEAVE THE POOR SHARKS IN THEIR HABITAT,
I worked in an aquarium that kept sand tiger sharks All their noses were severely damaged from running into the walls The staff truly cared for the animals but it was impossible to not see how captivity harmed them,
How disappointing I thought I was going to hear theyd become extinct ,
Aquariums should be shut down,
what if water flowed thru the tank like a wind tunnel,
RIP to all the animals who died,
C as n yhey just leave these wonderful fish in the ocean before there numbers dwindle down to near extinct,
This is inhumane,
How about we put humans in tankscages and put them in the ocean so sharks and other marine lifeforms can view them as an attraction like what we are doing to them,
Just Leave the sharks alone,
What they have it because i said they do,
Just leave those poor animals alone God humans disgust me sometimes Maybe one day aliens will kidnap us for display back on their home planets,
It will eat the aquarium thats why,
Your putting sharks in jail just so people can see them Sounds fair,
just leave those damn sharks alone lmao,
You know they are becoming an endangered species people Stop catching them,
Just build an underwater aquarium instead,
As much as sharks scare me it made me kinda sad when they said they wouldnt eat or they needed help swimming Poor things,
they dont do that very passionate,
I thought the video was finished when the Vox logo appeared after one minute,
Sharks are my favourite animalsif they die Ill be very sad edit if they die out and dont exist anymore,
SO WAIT WHY ARE THEY DYING,
They are making efforts in caging a shark Ugh just stop,
And theres a new movie The Meg,
At least they tried to do it as safely as possible I was surprised that they released them at all I thought they just kept letting them die,
VOX filmed it like it doesnt matter this shark aquarium need to be ended,
This is so sad,
right after I move away from Okinawa they get a great white smh,
Hmm stylistically a VICE rip off,
The best thing to do is leave them alone they dont belong inside a water tank they belong in their regular nature water they are in custom to leave these wild animals alone,
I have no desire to see a shark up close and Im pretty sure the shark feels the same way about me We need to learn to leave nature alone to do what shes done for millenia with or without us around,
Granted I can see yall point saying its kinda cruel and detrimental to keep killing these increasingly rare animals trying to keep them but theres a reason behind the madness First research Its a lot easier to study an animal in captivity as you have 24 hr access thats not hampered by weather hazards ornot being able to find a freaking shark big ocean you know Two conservation Yes it sounds ass backwards killing an animal to save it but they were trying to see if they could keep a shark in a secure location safe from illegal fishing wheremaybethey could breed it Its a pity they werent able to keep it though Perhaps in the future well figure out a better solution thatll help further these goals For now hope we can save the enviroment its living in and crack down on the fin trade,
Leave them tf alone subhumans,
This makes me so angry Leave them alone,
Robot sharks problem solved Compile behaviour from recordings of same species,
just dont the fact that they die easily means they should not be taken captive,
New Orleans aquarium has one,
I have a hypothesis on why they are dying For breathing sharks swim all the time even when they are asleep While in the aquarium they are not able to sleep as they hit the the walls of the aquarium This might be the reason why there are bruises near their nostrils,
434 It flew so high you could see the earths curve Flat earthers Triggered,
To minimise drag it soarer so high you could see the Earths curve Take that Flat Earthers,
Not sure how a plane that flew successfully for almost 30 years could be considered a fail,
Because they didnt thank the plane driver,
*Comorde takes about 35 hours to London* *_Gravity you think im a joke to you_*,
The reason that supersonic passenger aircrafts failed is because the pilot would announce that theyre taking off and the passengers would hear that message after the plane landed,
348 thank me later,
Easily one of the best planes of all time and definitely an example of what we can achieve as a collective species when were not all insulting and killing each other,
*American Airlines has left the chat*,
747 s crashed so many times but nobody banned them why did they ban concorde just because of 1 crash 50 years ago in 1970s you can fly supersonic fron london to NY in 35 hours in 2019 its 8 hrs 15 minutes this is stupid,
the Concorde featured a droop snoot Droop Snoot  the Snoot would Droop the Snoot Drooped THE BEST DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR EVER,
*The snoot droop* 2019 anyone ,
Short Summary of the video 1 Cost of the plane 2 Noise when the plane is flying at supersonic speed,
This beautiful creature which you could hear coming from miles away would fly over my house in London every day at the same time and every one around would stop and look up and watch her roar past not only did you see her you also felt her and this always made me smile,
Has it not taken the titanic 106 years and counting to cross the Atlantic,
The snoot drooped,
At 040 Vox which one are you looking at Me I am looking at United Airlines and their failures and totally not Concorde buttering the bread on the landing,
The Crash was not due to Concorde Tyres was it Absolute tripe If youre hurtling down the runway at 250mph and you run over a shard of metal 17 inches long off the intake of a Douglas DC10 that took off a minute before your tyre is going to burst There had been blowouts on Concorde before but more than any other aircraft at the time Because the Concorde had a fast takeoff speed a blowout was more likely to cause damage to the air frame AirFrance did not correctly Fuel the Aircraft They overfilled the fuel tanks and exceeded the MTOW of the plane As an aeronautical engineer I find this surprising because this is a number fundamental to the design and certification of any aircraft So essentially Air France was responsible as well as the Operator of the DC10 You could argue the DC10 was a flawed design It had many crashes where parts would fall off it The Manufacturing Quality of the DC10 was abysmal The DC10 was only 5 years older than Concorde It has so far been in 55 Accidents 32 of which were complete losses and has killed 1261 people Thank god it is not in operational Service They should have Grounded the DC10 as well when Concorde crashed Bits falling off it constantly In Conclusion Vox are terrible Journalists,
It flew so high you could see the earths curve well no wander flat earthers exist They took this plane away,
Stupid title The Concorde did NOT fail  The human failed in not making another supersonic passenger aircraft,
137 hours Excuse me but the Titanic has yet to cross the Atlantic at all,
You failed to note that the debris left on the runway by a Continental Airways DC10 that had an inappropriate repair done was the immediate cause of the accident It was not exclusively a tire design fault on the Concorde I also doubt that the presence of a Flight Engineer was much of a factor in the retirement given the fares charged their salary would be trivial,
723 Did she just spit on that man,
*dRoOP snOOT ThE snOOt wOuLD dRoOp*,
*Clearance sale* 349 The Droop Snoot Price 1 like *buy before out*,
i was obsessed with this plane as a kid,
The snoot would droop,
They had this in 1976 imagine what governments have now hiding from us,
I flew with it as a child Sad it is not operating anyomore,
They shouldve done a connection in a couple airports off the coast,
i remember seeing concorde set off when i was like 5 and i cried at how loud it was,
It didnt fail The British government refused to fund it anymore It was expensive It was making a loss Thats pretty much it I love the mention of Chuck Jaeger in there so America got a little bit of credibility in the video but everybody knows Britain designed the plane he flew in and indeed unofficially Britain had already broken the sound barrier first but our government suppressed it and to get vital financial deals in other areas our government LET the USA win the sound race When Concorde first flew to the USA people there complained in every way possible and mostly out of sour grapes because Britain along with France did it first without any American technology,
If Boeing made this plane the US wont be complaining,
Just in the comment section looking for triggered flatearthers,
We miss you concorde the emperor of the skies,
Absolutely amazing aircraft Pure beauty NOT made by computers but a human brain,
447 He dreams of rain He dreams of gardens in the desert sand He wakes in vain  He dreams of love as time runs through my hand He dreams of fire those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire and in the flames her shadows play in the shape of a mans desire His desert rose each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower no sweet perfume ever tortured him more than this And as she turns  this way she moves in the logic of all his dreams this fire burns he realize that nothings as it seems,
Another reason Concord failed is because it did not have TVs,
Poor Frane Selak is on the plane when the tire fails He survives,
526 It wasnt the tires fault The runway had debris a titanium alloy that fell from the engine of a DC10 aircraft that took off on the same runway minutes before That metal piece punctured the tire and bounced onto the wing where the fuel tank is causing a fire at takeoff Youd think they do more research before making a short documentary about the concorde,
Because of angled landing the Concord featured a droop snoot A droop snoot Yeah the snoot would droop The snoot drooped You see this is truly the real reason as to why this needs to be brought back,
520 the airline that my youngest brother and my mother flew on to Montpellier to attend the Battle of the Year a breakdancing title He came in 5th place as the sole juvenile squad in the title,
The answer why this program failed is complicated only for complete morons The answer is simple as that the game players from FAA did everything they could to sabotage this program from day oneand finally succeeded I spent 35 years of my life in the cockpit so I know this from my own experience,
man i wish i had traveled in that beast,
Id rather be uncomfortable for three and a half hours than slightly less uncomfortable for seven hours,
this plane could cross the Atlantic in 35 hrs IN 1976 AT MACH 22 1354 MPH it could go faster but the airframe would melt the jet expanded by 1 ft or 300mm at cruising altitude  No Pentium chips all analogue and nothing has come close and it was BRITISH  sadly missed gathering dust in the Smithsonians,
It was too expensive NEXT VIDEO,
432 It Flied so high you could see the Earths *CURVE* Am looking at you Flat Earthers,
I used to watch it fly over my flat in Mexico City In the 80s Stopped me every time,
this makes me so sad ,
I hardly call close to 30yrs service a failure A very unique joint venture aircraft encompassing the best talent from France  Great Britain,
A besutiful bird Yep 50 years ago we even put men on the moon haha An amazing time,
We should still have a faster then sound supersonic plane Its nonscene not to have a plane that can be quick and go fast today in our modern era If they had wanted to upgrade that plane they could of I dont think it failed I think the people running it where lazy and cheap,
Sting Im an English man in Concorde,
I do wish someone would try this again,
BRO NO JOKE I WAS AT THAT MUSEUM 3 DAYS AGO AND LOOKED THIS UP BECAUSE I SAW A REAL CONCORDE,
how does a sonic boom at 30000 feet cause damage on the ground,
Me and my dad were lucky enough to go on one in the 90s as he had a business deal h honestly it was terrifying,
Comment section *Take that flat earthers*,
I can tell whoever wrote this was a big fan of the phrase droop snoot,
Wait so they could fly higher so the sonic boom wouldnt affect people,
When the concord lands it looks like a huge bird of prey swooping down on its victim,
My Aunt rode on this plane twice and she said it was not very loud in the cabin Also she said it was a very enjoyable trip,
The internet is also part of the reason why a new Concorde is unlikely for awhile Concorde flights were mostly for business because companies could afford to pay the higher ticket prices It is much cheaper to just use a webcam and telecommute meetings than to fly 4000 miles,
Concorde was a technological wonder which was taken out of action everywhere because of one crash and the noise Using that logic why isnt the regular passenger plane banned as that has crashed thousands of times before and it is also very loud Gotta love that logic,
A jaw droping droop snoot had me quaking for some reason lmfao,
They still land like a Ryanair though Ryanair couldve talen iy although it would become a total fail but still,
So what your telling me is Europe is better,
please remember concord was 1 of the safest planes ever it was down to a dc10 that shot this bird down,
IT FAILED BECAUSE THIS PLANE WAS THE OBJECT TO PROVE FLAT EARTH,
Concorde was the most successful Jet passenger plane to cruise at twice the speed of sound and in its 27 years of service performing this task routinely  that achievement will not be repeated in our life time For British Airways  it was by far  the safest Aircraft on record and the word successful is a more appropriate  in technical terms,
Such a PROFESSIONAL video Thank you,
i guess mars colonization has no better future,
what went wrong *next frame showing smoking hole in the ground* oh yea,
It was 60s technology and uneconomical to operate Production costs were written off by the government so effectively they didnt cost BA anything to purchase,
No mention that Concorde had a habit of losing occasionally losing rudder panels inflight,
Concordes Engine was made in the UK and US Rolls Royce,
I flew on this aircraft in 1999 It was a incredible experience I woke up one morning and realized it was just a dreamlol,
I am really glad that my parents tore me out of bed at the age of six in 1996 to go to Sola Airport in Stavanger Norway and watch a Concorde land A unique experience unattainable today a memory I will keep forever,
Eddie Bravo needs to fly on a Concorde look into it,
I always wanted to fly a Concorde and I still will,
*Ive found it* The curator came on screen and I screamed DROOP SNOOT,
101 Wait didnt it crash because some scrap metal hit the tire and made a fire of the left engine,
Cost There Saved you 10 minutes,
Exposes flat Earth No Curve No Spin Exposes Air Combustion as the Tiny wings cannot contain the needed fuel required in conventional combustion Secret Technologies,
And now to see the future you have to visit a museum and wonder why,
I can recall as a child seeing the Concorde We were on the beach on Long Island My mother pointed up and said look the Concorde I looked up saw something I think then I looked up again and it was gone I was pretty young so Im not really sure what I saw But I do recall that memory,
Because DC10 exists Thats why,
430 Bring back the Concorde and put every single goddamn flatearther inside it right now Shut em up please,
Offtheshelf Commercial computers were available to design engineers from The late 1950s,
Big dislike for this IDEOLOGICAL BIT OF PROPAGANDA I want PROGRESS NOT FOR THE KOCH BROTHERS TO BECOME YET MORE POLITICALLY POWERFUL,
Omg look at those tiny windows Compare that to the gorgeous B787 windows,
If Boeing had got a supersonic airliner in the air first the US would never have banned fasterthansound travel overland,
We are going backward Quickly,
Got retired just as Flat Earthers were coming into main stream They couldnt allow them to get the evidence ,
A normal French meal takes 2 to 3 hours Ummm,
Imagine Getting penetrated by the Concorde nose at full speed,
can you imagine going from NY to Australia in 3 hours that would be neat,
I always wondered what happened with the Concord Thanks for answering all my questions in this video,
351 no problem,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLANES EVER MADE,
I used to see Concorde taking off out of Heathrow as a kid and used to run outside every time I heard it No mistaking the sound Amazing sight,
And tens of thousands of regular airplanes each month arent contributing to global warming This is the big lie that the government wont tell you,
Now with kicking out Elon Musk he will lose revenue in his projects which will put them behind If the governement wants something they can get it America just hates the idea that Concorde was designed and engineered by the British,
this is soviet plane made in Ussr,
Concord was a beautiful design I was sad to see that beautiful bird go away,
Massive damage to the ozone layer Heh Right Professor Nutty,
Because it wasnt American technology They killed it with their hypocrate propogander,
The SR71 made this trip in 25 hours and that included a 20 min air refueling Ill give you a hintthe SR71 could have done it much less time,
The qoncorde feature is called *DROOP SNOOT*,
As an Aerospace Engineering student this made me tear up a little bit,
this is how it would fail if it was me flying *PULL UP*,
I saw 1 of these SSTs in Austin Texas in 1980 at Bergstrom Air Force Base It was amazing to see even then,
*it features a droop snoot* *the snoot drooped*,
The concord was not developed my computers but through math Do you seriously think that engineers no longer do the math,
It failed because the average person couldnt afford it,
A 787 can make good time crossing just airlines fly them economically for fuel efficiency they fly faster and higher than the standard plane,
Economics It had to fly 7 hours a day at 65 capacity and the seats were 5000USD RT,
Dammit DC10,
People say it was not ECONOMICAL Well if you valued your time and had to sign a multi million dollar deal in the usa and had to be back for dinner in uk it makes a lot of sense The concorde was reserved for a NICHE MARKET of SUPER RICH not for cattle class flying,
It soared so high you could see the Earths curve Let the flatearthers fly in a Concorde then crash it at sea,
Sr71 Hold my beer,
claims it went so high you can see earths curve yet no photos or video of the curve lmfao,
As a French i remember that plane and the day of the crash on the news I think we should create project Concorde 2 in coalition with Brits When we do not wage war on each other we create the best weather the Concorde or the tunnel under the channel just marvel of engineering ,
Fun fact due to the highspeed of travel and the droop snoot design the cockpit actually expanded during flight During flight you could put your hand in a gap between two panels a gap that didnt exist when parked on ground,
I watched the concord takeoff from mascot airport sydney Australia many years ago  it shook the ground  was amazing,
Why did it fail How utterly moronic It flew for almost 3 decades and remains one of mans greatest technical achievements,
When BA Concordes began the London  New York route they had huge billboard ads Breakfast in London Lunch in New York The graffiti scribbled underneath said Luggage in Bermuda,
Dream of ssts and all the addociated catch words eg in Germany taxi firms run on Mercedes fleets Try replacing them with McLarens or Porches for FASTER time saving trips at double the fares It does not take a university educated boffin to tell you what the result will be,
Ive been in that museum hangar at the air and space museum Quite a place if youre into aviation I would recommend it,
Than lets try again We need a supersonic jet,
I stood under it once as it flew over Jamaica Bay Loud bugger,
American jealousy Nothing to do with the noise sonic boom or anything else 27 years of fantastic success with not one failure caused by Concorde,
It did have a Soviet knockoff TU144 2 built That did fail too,
Lets make it very clear  Concorde didnt fail Supersonic transport failed Concorde was a fusion of art technology and engineering that was a century ahead of its time,
Thanks for this I always wanted to know,
To me this stopped due to flat earth conspiracys,
it failed because of some DC10,
622 speaks of environmental damage while smoking,
Droopity snoop Snoot didi droop Droopdy snootdy droop Droopdy snootdy snootdy drooped Droop didi snoot droop snoot Droop didi snoot droop Droop Droop Snoot didi droop Drooped didi snoot Drooped dithe snoot drooped,
Im pissed I never got to fly on a concorde,
Hey Mom did you know the Concorde gets you here in half the time,
which one are you looking at got me good there vox,
Elon Musk has a better idea that can taken you from Los Angeles to Australia in 40 minutes I like that better Its basically a rocket ship thats travels in the upper part of the stratosphere and rockets itself to the destination It will only work for coastal cities because it will have to be far enough because of the noise,
Because the *S N O O T D R O O P E D*,
Concorde didnt fail it was discontinued Not the same,
Also birds that fly into the intake plane would blow up and crash to earth,
Droop snoot,
It wasnt made by computers they used math,
wow dude huge Titanic spoilers wtf,
the tyres and fuel cells should have been made from Aramid the Paris crash was caused by a bolt from the aircraft that had used the same runway previously Was a very sad day and we have mourned Concords loss knowing that she could and should have been saved it would have had even better RR engines by now John UK,
Wow so as a retired Aerospace Engineer I didnt use computers in the 70s or 80s Thanks for telling me,
Too fast vs not enough people overall travelling This Plane would essentially become a Monopoly due to its efficiency Another example of technology held back for long term gain of that almighty dollar,
The AVRO ARROW CF105 built in 1957 was the fastest thing in the sky and even compared to the F35 of todays standards,
If only we still had concords there wouldnt be any flat earthers,
2003 It was grounded before I turned 21 Such a shame I would have loved to fly on one or really any supersonic I always wonder what happened We had space exploration and supersonic flight now only a focus on consumer electronics I would have imagined that in the age of CAD and hybrid fuels wed have found a solution to noise and fuel concerns,
Because it was expensive unsafe and way to damn loud to fly over residential,
Concorde wads awesome beautifulregardless of the cost,
How does not having a supersonic jet delay progress Vox,
I just cant get over the fact that Americans once considered something too loud,
My parents went one time on the Concorde in 2001,
BritishFrench cooperation  doomed from the start,
In hindsight it was sacrificed at the altar of UN Agenda 21,
It didnt fail it got old and started to have multiple failures Some might remember when half the vertical stabilizer broke off Airplanes dont live forever they wear out Now the real question is why havent they built a newer and better SST Best answer is first economics and second environmental issues,
Faster than the earths spin and flew so high you could see the earths curve That is crazy,
And no one ran further tests to exact a successful future Concorde,
To think the droop snoot is now a meme,
God id love that could go to Europe all the time,
It should have flown the Pacific  Australia and New Zealand would have benefited,
The Concorde crash was not the Concordes fault The plane that took of before it dropped a big metal piece Any aircraft would fail,
That plane was a POS I used to hear them when they took off and I can tell you from personal experience you would NOT love it,
Theres nothing funny about Droop Snoots,
Concorde didnt fail it just became too expensive to maintain,
Seen one on guam land and take off in 88was very cool,
I dont mind the time spent on flights once Im in the seat Sure its far from perfect but weve got our devices now to choose our work or entertainment and its a small price to pay to bounce around the globe On the other hand the airport experience from the freeway exit to get to the departing airport all the way to picking up the rental car at the other end of the trip is utter bullshit that needs a huge technological overhaul,
The 2JZ fell out of it,
its good this aircraft is no longer in flight we can save the earth a little bit from global warming as a woke person i agree,
Ill save you from his highpitched vocals Accident was caused by Debris from a Continental Airline jumbo jet on the runway It pounced up and hit the fuel tank Pretty sad,
Damage the Ozonereally  the country that denies global warming,
You lost me at it flew so high you could see the earths curvelol,
I was not even alive during the 27 years of service,
Literally boxed ,
Elon Musk will help us with faster travel time ,
Concorde flew for 27 years how the hell could that be described as a fail Yes commercial factors eventually forced it into retirement but youd need to skip over the other 20 years of its service to call it a fail,
Canada made one of the fastest jets the Avro Arrow,
Snoot Drooped was the name of my first band,
Is that why Seatle SuperSonics went out of business to Now OKC thunder what a name,
we just recently had two fighter jets go supersonic in switzerland almos half of switzerland was able to hear it it was really really loud,
chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier after the British pilots did it but was asked to wait for Mr yager to publicly do it THe Russian plane failed because they did not steal the engine plans that had been modified to slow down the Air intake flow,
And it took me 35 hours from Newcastle upon Tyne to Malta,
The most beautiful object ever made by mankind,
CONCORDE the best looking and best named Aircraft EverThe Name Concored says it all,
Easy question too expensive to maintain and tickets were too costly,
Because nobody could sleep through such a short journey and speed,
TLDR The Concorde stopped flying because it was insanely expensive to operate The price of a ticket from JFK to Heathrow cost more than a firstclass ticket from JFK to Tokyo and you didnt get as much legroom as you wouldve on that flight to Tokyo either The Concorde _devoured_ fuel and its supersonicoptimized shape made it very dangerous to takeoff and land in bad weather,
749 I feel like if a group of people came together most issues that the Concorde faced could be fixed,
It featured a droop snoot Droop snoot The snoot would droop The snoot drooped,
droop snoot,
XX century supersonic commercial flight XIX century flat earthers,
Oh the cute little lie it was due to a problem specific to Concordes tires Nope Investigations proved a DC10 from Continental Airlines lost a one foot and a half long titanium part from its thrust reverser on the runway on which concorde rolled which destroyed a wheel and projected some parts of it under its wing which damaged a fuel tank and caused other problems that put the plane on fire On a side note there were several events of this kind during the carrier of the plane all around the world,
You know I miss these planes they were awesome This plane will be missed in all of our hearts,
Protect Aborigines from the boom 915,
I got a great little treasure at a county auction 4 new sterling silver liquor bottle tags in certified Concord boxes Paid 20 for all Going sell value is 210  Hanging onto them,
It failed because it wasnt american it was from other nations and usa hates it Just think about how many jumbos crashed But no one banned them,
But why did this supersonic plane fail The Concorde was NOT profitable,
Flat earthers did you hear that see the curvature of the earth,
It failed because Continental Airlines mechanics left debris on the runway and it burst into flames ending an era,
I am 49 and lucky enough to have seen the Concord fly over my house as a child many times going in and out of Heathrow airport never forget the sound,
Concorde only carried 100 passengers  tickets cost around 3 times the price of first class it was also early 60s technology  used lots of fuel,
Convair had already solved the CoG by fuel switching and skin heat problems with the B58 years earlier,
My dad once flew on the Concorde BA overbooked his flight so upgraded him,
Cause its called a  Rich man deathtrap for the elite  thats what the titanic did for the federal reserve it killed a lot of important people on that ship our good Rich understands this,
Limited number of accessible runways around the world available in politicallystablefriendly countries World fuel political and labor crisiss The Shaw of Iran ousted cutting off over middle east access Rivaling companies like Boeing asTucker tried to with cars in Detroit GOOD LUCK The basic Concord designs are still used in a military capacity usually as bombers shhh  BEST REGARDS ,
Well theres still one concorde that is runningUS Air Force B1 bomber,
Concorde was a great aircraft and a legend in its own time however there were issues with this aircraft that were not publicized 1 Many times the aircraft landed in New York on reserve fuel and basically fumes in the fuel tank 2 One landing in New York found the Rudder sheared almost completely away The crew experianced a vibration through out the flight Many other situations occured on the aircraft with no incident Thank the good Lord,
A one way ticket in 2003 was almost 9000 and the plane was nearly 30 years old There were no alternatives and you could save 8000 at the cost of 4 hours of boredom on a more efficient subsonic jet,
Tooloud is what I heard It was a beautiful plane I saw it land in Miami on its last flight,
My mum had been on one of those and my grand father ussed to fly these,
Cant wait for someone to claim this plane didnt exist because you could see the Earths curve and therefore proves the Earth is a spherical shape,
Without having watched the video I want to sayThis was a strong computerwhy did it break I have nothing against clickbait but at least make it so it baits,
354 The Concord featured a droop snoot Droop Snoot  The Snoot would Droop The Snoot Drooped BEST THING IVE EVER HEARD IN A PLANE DOCUMENTARY,
Why does it sound like a muffled tie fighter,
27 yrs services mean FAILWah ,
This was informative,
did it I didnt know it failed it was used for years even Phil Collins took it to play both Live Aids in UK and US no problem was maintenance too expensive and sound too loud,
the *snoot* would *droop*,
Super Sonic less then 35 capital did u back states about to take flight flush it down,
Gone because of jealousy Just like the Avro Arrow,
 It flew so high you could see the curve of the Earth but they dont show you that view  Sounds like complete BS to me The highest Concorde was ever claimed to reach was 58000 ft Well heres RAW actual footage from over 105600 ft or 20 miles high 47600 ft higher than Concorde could go  but as anyone can see there is absolutely NO CURVE to be seen  draw your own conclusions httpsyoutubeDWOquYkL7_k,
The Droop Snoop *Markiplier has entered the chat*,
My economy teacher was able to fly with it lucky guy,
This plane was way ahead of its time Should still be flying,
Beautiful design,
Amazingly well done video on the Concord airplane,
what a machine but a ticket would cost you a small fortune,
One piece of very important information this video did not include was that when it mentioned that Concorde punctured a tire at 516 the puncture was actually caused by a metal piece that fell off from an aircraft taken off prior to Concordes departure The tire puncture was not actually Concordes fault In other words the Concorde was too good for its generation that it was required to be grounded,
It flew over my house in Montreal in 1976 Deafening sound It likely landed there because of the 1976 Olympics,
Why id it fail It did not Clickbait title,
My Uncle flew on this for business and said the cramped interior was definitely payment for expeditious delivery,
There is a concord in Manchester Collection i like concord,
Quick answer Money,
wooooSO SHWEEEETTTmuch love Tee with LIONS NAMED LEOthe music worldwide,
Because we cant have cool things they cost too much money Same reason we landed on the moon 50 years ago and pretty much stalled until a few years ago,
Back in the 1970s I was involved with a costbenefit analysis of Concorde and the overwhelming result showed that 1 it was too expensive to run 2 It could not carry enough passengers to make it viable 3 It was aimed at an elitist clientelle with lots of money to spare 4 way out of the reach of most travellers 5 the reason the Americans did not build it was they realised that the future lay in producing aircraft that could carry hundreds of people economically planes like the European A380  Technically it was a brilliant aircraft but commercially it was a white elephant,
Informative and attractive channel Subscribed,
But why did this supersonic plane fail Uhbecause it blew up,
From the evidence presented it seems highly likely that deficiencies were apparent due to proboscis flaccidity Otherwise known as a Drooping Snoot,
The Best Passenger Supersonic carrier in the world,
I think the premise is false I would argue that the Concorde was not a failure at all The fact that it was in service from 1976 to 2003 27 years and experienced only one catastrophic accident was a tribute to how robust the aircraft was especially given all the advanced features it employed The retirement of the Concorde was due mostly to external factors related to changes in air travel in general global economic factors and increasing maintenance costs There was nothing wrong with the airframe itself save for a design flaw in the landing gear a flaw that ended up leading to the Air France 4590 accident Had the economic outlook been better its possible that the gear issue would have been fixed and they would still be flying today,
i flew concord regularly from Bahrain to London and London to New York i listed 89 flights since then it seems like we have gone backwards,
D R O O P S N O O T,
THE DC  IS WHY CONCORDE FAILED IT KILLEd AIR FRANCE,
the Concorde featured a droop snoot  droop snoot yea the snoot would droop the snoot drooped,
I guess the flat earthers think everyone that flew on the Concorde was lying about being able to see the Earths curvature when it got to its cruise altitude LOL,
Supersonic for some ppl could cause faint like dwarf ppl or ppl with cardiovascular problems,
It didnt failan accident happened that grounded the Concordthe plane flew for over 20 yrsits an old plane,
Cost Done Saved you 10 minuets,
Id like to know the name of the Music please,
527 that is actually wrong a Continental Airlines DC10 lost a piece of the engine cowl the piece was run over by concord causing it to blow a tire the tire piece then stuck the delta wing causing a shock wave in the fuel and for the tank to be blown open Concorde was already committed to takeoff by this point a resulting fire from leaking fuel burned off the Concords control surfaces and it was unable to return for landing or make it to next airport,
The Air Force used Oklahoma City as super sonic guinea pigs Hope they got sued,
Its a gorgeous plane ,
China is building supersonic flights at much cheaper cost lets see what happens,
I cross it in less than 10 seconds while dreaming,
All those concerns about noise and ozone by the FAA and others US administrations are just bullshits The only purpose was protectionism Boeing and Lockheed failed to design and produce a supersonic airliner thats why all these craps came up just to make sure than no US airline company buys Concorde And it worked after the ban of civilian supersonic flights above US territory all the US airlines companies canceled their Concorde preorders You dont hear any sonic boom on the ground when the plane flies at 60000 ft And that ozone concern A threat to the ozone seriously  No proof Meanwhile the heavy damages done by CFC gas to the ozone were already known at that time and the US did nothing to stop the production until they signed the Montreal protocol in 1987,
The Snoop drooped,
When you said which one are you looking at I was looking at the normal one,
Beautiful plane but not sustainable Flying only 132 people at mach two think of the intense consumption of fuel per person and per flight,
Emails are faster,
I flew on the concorde twice Greatest plane of all time absolutely no question,
You can see the scared face of Sting while traveling in Concorde haha Love this aerodynamics marvel That snoot just mindblowing,
that concorde had a sting in its tail,
So  in a nutshell  why cant we get Concorde back up in the air  we have managed it with Spitfires etc ,
When America was for globalization,
It didnt fail  It flew for 25 years Best aircraft ever,
spectacular documentary concise in detail wit and selfindulgence Youre a genuinely talented filmmaker and narrator,
Business plans you hate to see it man,
T H E S N O O T D R O O P E D,
If I was rich Id have one made for me because they are amazing great video,
Fuel consumption  Only reason Thats why all planes nowadays fly at top 800805Kmph,
You know when you are flying at twice the speed of sound when the flight attendant slaps your face before you manage to get a word out,
OMG I FINALLY FOUND IT Droop snoot,
the starship goes from london to new jork in 29 minutes,
This is sad I wish I had flown on one,
It was nerfed thats all theyll probably put it back on the next patch,
If not for our inquentioable greed as Humans for Power status and control we would easily and already be in space And likely eternal life through bionics and we would have joined the stars long long ago,
The new SST will be very different and is coming in the next generation of aircraft,

Dammit are we gonna talk about the Concorde our flat earth stuff,
I miss nonpolitical Vox videos Theyre so compelling and high quality,
It flew over the Atlantic in 35hrs It didnt fail,
Fail it was an absolute stonking success flew for best part of 3 decades at twice the speed of sound,
This plane could travel at 1365mph just over twice the speed of sound making the trip possible in 2hrs 45 mins,
Astronaughts couldnt see due to the height of the cockpit so they lowered it and called it the snoot droop so there was a meme created called The snoot drooped,
Your definition of failure is very different to mine Sir,
431 yea cuz the earths flat___,
so it flew for 23 years and youre calling it a failure,
Snoot drooop,

Questionhow is the globalspherical map accurately created Im guessing its an averagemedian calculation from multiple satellites but wouldnt these need to have equal distance measurements syncronised Then the longitude and latitude to each point is measured from each satellite etc which forms the base figures Accurate satellite distance from sea levels as well Loads of mindbending but cool variables,

its changed in flat Because You Stretched it,
For all of the people that are saying the earth is flat Think about it like this When a boat sails off torwards the horizon the further the boat goes the less you can see of the boat The first part you cant see is the bottom of the boat Then you cant see the middle and suddenly You cant see the boat at all If the world was flat you would be able to see all parts of the boat If you dont believe me try putting a paper boat on a ball Then start rotating the ball with the boat on it and see how the boat disappears,
Yall talking about flat earth while Im an active peter griffin chin earth supporter,
Mercator projection is the right one cause if you shape the mercator projection it will shape greenland smaller,
People who think the Earth is flat are wrong If the earth was flat cats wouldve already pushed off everything by now,

THIS IS FAIR The Earth was originally a scribble drawn by a baby from the stars Each country is a scribble So it was actually drawn on blue paper with a green pen Then they decided to wrap it around a foam sphere Fair I think yes Sorry,

You need to UV Unwrap the earth to make the map flat,
Short answer *USE A GLOBE*,
Earth isnt flat Earth is square,
Yea all the maps are wrong because the earth is a cube,
All flat earthers WHY DONT YOU GO INTO SPACE AND TRAVEL AROUND THE EARTH HUH,
Google maps uses Mercator Projection because the real purpose of the Mercator Projection was navigation So does the Google maps,
Fascinating video I could learn about maps all day,
Why do you guys think the Earth is flat *iTs A dOnUt*,
Polygonal or cube would probably preserve most proportions of land,
I thought you were a flat earther for second there,

You have just seriously confused the life out of me congrats buddy,
Democrats say everything is the imperialist White Mans fault,
Draw a better one plz Vox,
Wtf does the European imperialistic thing have to do with the map Didnt he say it was for navigation im confused,
The Flat Earth society has members all around the globe,
The real question is why does he have a knife just randomly in his pocket ,
Why do Hurricanes rotate in different directions from Hurricans Here in US  Their Water Drains opposite  You Know Why  Because the world is Round Southern Hemisphere Hurricanes rotate opposite from northern Hemisphere Southern Hemisphere is on the Bottom and they even see different stars,

Maths is awesome It along with its brother Physics defines existence Theres talk of making a 3D representationmap of the universe* Now that is going to have some interesting problems considering the distances and sizes involved *Theyre first with the help of the Gaia satellite and other satellites measurementsobservations going to make one of the Milky Way Galaxy Which makes sense really You map your home town before you map your county country planet People speaking of flatearth The problems explained in this about making a flat map of a spherical world shows how easy it should be to make a flatearth flat map and yet its not happened because its not flat Now the universe on the other hand that might actually be flat,

Flat earth,

I cant understand math but *ok*,
Holy crap scientists want to make the map flat to tell us the earth is flat DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN,
And now for a non flat earth comment Hows everyone doing,
Well I guess that the perfect map is a globe that is not too spherical,
1000 knife vs globe,
The first European settlers didnt sail on ships turning upside down discovering land on a round pretty blue ball like they want us to think,
And then Theres flat earthers,
They do it right at Star Wars using holographic projections,
I dont know but the comparison between Greenland and Africa make me laugh,
You can hear theILLUMINATI sound,
Great video on Maps aka charts Chart is what a seafarer will call a Map But Mercator projection or Mercator chart is not obsolete today Infact Mercator Chart is the most widely used CHART by a seafarer for day to day Navigation Even today electronic charts are mostly Mercator electronic navigation chartENC GPS or DGPS is there to give us a position on chart But for navigation Charts are still very much essential,

Flat Earth Believers Like Sphere Earth Believers Comment,
for some reason 99 of comments are about flat earth,
They should replace world maps with globes and interactive maps on LCD screens to solve this problem,
why dont we just have two circular maps one for each side Edit Im an idiot,

Hahah your bad if you say earth flat,
Hmm not my kind of stuffDont understand anywayScience studentsWatch this,
You just cut the world in half well done my friend,
Youre all wrong the earth is a fidget spinner because they both spin,
Yes because the earth is a sphere I think most intelligent people know a flat map isnt an exact representation of a spherical earth And if you dont you probably should have paid more attention in school Mostly geometry,
Godugum ingilizce mi biliyorum ben,
Wow 6th grade videos Thanks Vox,
You should buy some better jeans for this presentation ,
Did they stop teaching this in grade school in the US Love Vox videos but honestly curious,
Now Google Maps are using 3D model of Earth,

I thought you were going to cut up the ball into slices and then place those slices together Thats how many flat world maps were made back in the day We didnt fill in the areas between the slices You had to imagine how the Earth would look if you put it back to together Its similar to the HELPix projection only the edges are curved and the pieces connect closer to the equator,
So youre saying the earth is actually flat eh,
If the earth is flat why do brackets look like this   And not like this  ,
Genial mas votos para vox,
Gets annoying how many people in the US dont know this,
38k snails disliked this video,
In germany its forbidden to be in the left lane if youre not overtaking somebody,
You know the rules if you got your license,
I m amazed that people actually doesnt know this You should be able perceive this as child if you have ever been on a highway,
UK viewers  watch this in the mirror,
CALIFORNIA ARE YOU LISTENING,
Thank You for posting this video Funny how drivers in Europe automatically get this and move to the right without getting offended A simple flash of your headlights for someone to please more over and let them by is as common as holding the door open for someone Keep right except to pass people Its called common sense,
imagine you driving that slow on the left lane on the German autobahn and another guy behind you is coming at you doing 200kmh,
My favorite thing is when I go in the right lane wiht a cozy speed not under the limit someone catches up to me with very little speed difference moves into the left lane with the same speed I keep my speed too or maybe slow down a bit to make the takeover easier and this car just drives behind me for 10km 6 miles or more Guys if you want to pass pass if you dont stay in the right lane And if you pass dont slow down below the speed of the car you just passed,
I thought this was common sense guess not,
I once talked to someone who was staying in the left lane matching speed with the right for miles and miles The conversation went something like this Me The left lane is for passing Once youre past someone you get back in the right Him No its the fast lane I can stay in it because I was going fast Me but you werent even Him Yes I was Please use the term passing lane It leaves no room for ambiguity,
Put it in the driving written test so everyone knows,
How stupid are you in the us We have followed this rule in Europe since 1950 Its always worked,
Vox from next time please dont forget to mention that this is applicable only for the countries that drives in the right Some stupids in my country  we drive on the left will blindly follow whatever is on the internet They would think that they have learnt something new,
And quit driving the same speed as the guy next to you,
Those same slow left lane drivers are the same ones that complain about tailgaters,
Omg this video should be mandatory to watch before anyone could drive Some people are simply inconsiderate,
Waitaminutethere are people that dont know this I just assumed the non passers were trolling a**holes Its in state driving books,
Amen This is a pet peeve of longtime knowledgeable drivers Everyone should be aware of this,
Im only 17 and I dont drive yet I know this Isnt this supposed to be the basics of driving lmao,
It said keep on the right and I was like what  Then I realised the Americans Drive on the wrong side of the road ,
Its amazing how many people whove been driving for years dont know that the left lane or the hammer lane is for passing or for faster drivers,
Just dont drive on the left if you are not passing someone,
Good job Vox now more people would stay on the right unless passing,
The number of people that continue to argue against this concept is astonishing Why would you disagree with a proven method that creates safer conditions and reduces traffic on our roadways I guess theres no cure for ignorance and stupidity no matter how much evidence you throw at these morons,
UK viewers I got fined for driving too fast on the left lane,
Wait isnt left lane is for slow vehicles Oh this is right driving countries,
We have this in Victoria Australia but only on freeways and country highways and you have to stay in the left not right,
This obviously isnt common sense or there wouldnt be a problem The problem is that Drivers Education DOESNT teach this and some people dont logically understand the concepts of flow dynamics Some people well let me rephrase that MANY PEOPLE are just completely inconsiderate and thoughtless and think that the road was built entirely for THEIR use only The roads were built for A LOT of people and the more CONSIDERATE we all are of those people the better things will be not just roads either This video is good because it at least STARTS the process of reorganizing how people think about it I would consider passing this video along to more people and then TALKING about it to more people This CONSIDERATION concept is WAY more important than most would tend to believe I think,
Theres a special place in hell reserved for people who drive slow in the left lane,
Earlier this week I saw cars blocking the left and center lanes which backed up traffic about a quarter mile I was worried that I was about to witness a massive pileup Speed limit advocates have a good point but the fact is they cant control what some drivers do when they see an opening So get the  out of their way and keep our roads  YOUR roads  safer Thank you Sincerely someone who doesnt even NEED to go into the left lane PS You enter the highway on the right You exit on the right If you have to you can stay in the center lane so you dont have to deal with the aforementioned right lane traffic entering the highway Why do you need to go all the way to the left,
You should only go in the left lane if you are 1 Overtaking on a multilane freewayexpressway 2 Passing on a twolane undivided road 3 Turning left 4 Driving in a lefthanddrive country,
There might be more to the Autoban than just that like how getting a license in Germany is significantly harder,
The best thing about this video is you admitted your error AND apologised Well done great vid,
Yea this is like one of the first things they teach you when you get your licence in Sweden Our left lane is always empty Is this really not something they teach you in the US,
Same for Right here in India reversed lanes and reversed seat position in cars,
Atleast you have lanes that people actually follow In India people own the car the road theyve passed the road they are driving on and even the upcoming road Let the red light show 10 seconds remaining and hear the honks of a few people Let it turn green and see the reaction time of 000001 sec I am generally not sexist or racist but it is my general observation that female drivers although drive good enough for their safety but do not have any idea about other people and how to overtake safely Teenage boys also dont have any fear for their life or anyone elses Youll hardly see anyone on your entire trip with a helmet,
So how do we make SURE that slow left lane drivers see this video Coming from one of the first groups of drivers described in this video,
I still have to ask for those who love to drive in the left lane  Does a two lane highway drive you nuts,
Yeeeeeah if you dont know this you shouldnt have a license,
Better solution self driving cars then ban human drivers,
I was about to comment on how we do it in Germany but then you mentioned it Thanks Because you dont want to drive slower than 70mpH in the left lane on that no speed limit Autobahn,
Here in Cebu City in South Road Properties You need to be 110kmh,
Florida w its massive amount of elderly Are u listening,
how can people not know this surely it is learning to drive 101,
When I got my licence I kept to the speed limit on motoways as I knew it to be 70 Then a guy overtook me from the wrong side while I was going exactly 70 learned my lesson,
Rolling chicanes  great video,
OOOOOHHHHHHHHH ok now i get it time to be a better driver,
It doesnt matter in Cali since its always heavy traffic,
The left lane is for passing IN OTHER NEWS TURNS OUT THE SKY IS BLUE,
Americans drive on the *incorrect* side,
Change the signs to be simple and direct LEFT LANE IS FOR PASSING ONLY,
You shouldnt drive slow in the left lane because there could come someone driving 300 kmh trying to pass Greetings from Germany,
Problem is Americans dont want to be second and will speed to hell just to keep you from passing them Then they go slow again,
You left out those who hog the left lane to intentionally slow everyone down because theyre passive aggressive wanna be cops who wish everyone would conform to their driving habits,
Either people are ignorant of the law or think they dont have to obey it because they dont like it Plus law enforcement doesnt enforce it because theyd never be doing anything else but writting citations for an infraction that doesnt cost that much However the number of accidents that hurt some and kill others because people arent smart enough to stay by nature Merritts a butt ton of very clear highway signs like speed limit signs posting this law,
Here in the Indiana the left lanes arent so much Passing lanes as they are fast lanes especially on roads with more than 4 lanes The left lanes do move faster but more often than not people tend to stay in the left lanes as opposed to simply using them to pass The end result is that you get lots of people who will CASUALLY pass on the right Not even making statement passes just causally passing on the right Ive been in several nearmisses on roads that have more than 4 lanes where another person tries to merge into the same lane that Im trying to merge into And yes Ill admit that I casually pass on the right far more often than I should,
nothing makes me angrier than a slow leftlane driver,
I take umbridge with the premise said at the beginning that there are two types of drivers its not about types of driver as you clearly later state Its the law,
There is a german saying Unwissenheit schtzt vor Strafe nicht Which means a lack of knowledge isnt a valid excuse it is actually your job to know the rules,
YES,
So why have the speed limit,
Utah drivers listen up really good I wish Utah would plaster this video all over the news for a month solid,
Every state needs to have more strict laws on this,
Keep right Thats the rule that I am trying to make everyone understand it Here in algeria,
Your example at 033 had the two truck drivers doing the speed limit The pickup driver couldnt pass the truck because the truck was doing the speed limit If the left lane wasnt used by vehicles such as the pickup  the right lane would be congested Please do not attack law abiding citizens,
I am going to start driving on the shoulder if people are driving too slowly on the left lane,
MA has one of the strictest laws just never enforced lol,
I think people need to be retested every 10yrs for license Cause apparently people dont understand basic driving laws anymore,
In India we have something like If you see a space take it and go,
if theres a jackass in front of u in the left lane 1 tail gate 2 use your left blinker 3 flash your lights 4 pass them on the right and honk at them,
All this talk about driving in the right lane is going again my mental code I have always stuck to the left Thankfully I dont drive,
I thought this was obvious,
i didnt know the rules so many drivers use that excuse but how did they get the licence if they dont know the rules,
You need to acknowledge the 3rd type Those who are totally aware that they are holding up traffic Bit of a power trip Literally I blame the Jerry Springer Show,
forces them to make better moves Basically were looking for a solution to roadidiocy,
Im looking at you Washington state and Tennessee,
It really takes a 3 minute video to explain this I thought it was common sense and courtesy,
left lane is the passing lane ie for passing only didnt they teach you when u first learn driving,
3 lanes right slow middle fast or passing left DEJA VU,
You dont say Wait A friend of mine cant wrap his mind around it Then I realized that unfortunately most of my friends dont get it,
When I moved to America 20 years ago I went to the DMV to get my license During the driving test The tester noticed that I keep returning to the right lane after passing another car and said Here in America You dont need to do that You can stay in the left lane If you switch lanes it just confuses the cars behind you For years I believed him Only a few years ago I discovered that he was wrong,
I thought this was common sense,
Well then i should drive slow on the right lane than to be safe,
about damn time nothing worse than a pacer in the left lane,
I propose a new law Drive slowly in the left lane get your vehicle plastered with paintballs,
Welcome to europe where its illegal to overtake on the right,
Please start enforcing this law in all 50 states,
too slow AKA the speed limit,
very good advice i already try to be fair to faster drivers by staying out of the left lane as much as possible using it only for passing but its good to be reminded Thanks for producing this video,
Chances you actually left from chicago 0,
90 when a prius moved into my lane they drive 510 mph slower than the speed i was going before,
This is the kind of content that I subscribe for serious informative and no sarcasm,
LEFT LANE FOR PASSING ONLYYYY *cries*,
Now play this over the Florida Turnpike on repeat,
Is dangeorous i always Drive at same speed the others,
Like a Semitruck taking 5 minutes to pass another Semitruck Causing several miles worth of backed up traffic potentially causing an accident As for myself Im anywhere between 915MPH constantly over the speed limit so Im always passing Just like most other people who are ALSO in the left lanelmao,
I even feel like a slow poke going 80 mph but at least Im not blocking the left lane,
Depends on the state though I live in Colorado and the left hand lane is only for passing if the speed limit is 65mph or more and only if traffic isnt dense,
Lmaoo why is this an issue ONLY in the states,
slow driver in Germany  400kph,
You need a more sophisticated kind of drivers license in order to enforce this rule Thats the reason why it actually works here in Germany Also this golden rule includes a strict prohibition of overtaking on the right,
Wait isnt this common sense xD When the dude said its better to use the left lane to pass man that cracked me up,
In most state left lane is passing lane,
Neat Ill have to remember this when i start driving,
simply just drive a monster truck,
Is this news This is common sence Americans,
If you obey the speed limit stay in the right lane LOL,
Thats a basic thing we know in Britain except its opposite because we usually drive on the left,
Being British this video was confusing at first I was like my life is a lie I always thought the left lane was slow not fast,
Its good that in finland thats the default everybody knows to drive on the rightits simple because there is usually 2 lanes at most,
Jokes on you We drive on the right side here,
058 unfortunately that wasnt an accident that black car intentionally tried to drive in front of the truck This was totally avoidable,
This confused me until I realized it was American and they drive on the other side of the road,
Thank God I hate slow drivers,
This is the first real valid argument Ive heard to keep me from leaning left on a issue,
This was common knowledge when I started driving decades ago but now so many drivers are completely ignorant or feel entitled to do what ever they want,
Finally someone mentioned this big issue I was raised in Mexico a country with wild drivers within the city However common education prevents unexperienced drivers to use the highway unless you know defensive driving I have faced this issue within United States only Where highway driving is so common therefore drivers dont really need to be educated to drive safely Within My main rules to drive in the highway are keep proper distance drive up to speed limit or slower in the right lanes and speed up or overpass on the left lanes,
This annoys me so much Im driving 130kmh on the fast lane and there will always be an idiot driving slow even after flashing them,
I dont get it Like in my country its FORBIDDEN to take over from the right Im pretty sure thats the case for most European countries,
Wow Vox I guess when you guys avoid politics you manage to report something correctly Amazing,
Of course this should be common knowledge This should be enforced with extreme prejudice,
Please send this to TEXAS DEPT OF PUBLIC SAFETY,
What about in the city when drivers jump out of their lane to steal the empty pole position at a red light  then drive super slow when the light turns green,
I see that commentators here are shocked that this isnt common knowledge among American drivers Let me tell you how bad it is especially in Virginia Here to get a drivers license all you need to know is how to start the car and where the gas and brake pedals are The US needs to pass laws supporting much higher quality driver education mandatory training In Japan the process is rigorous and the expectations for motorists is that they are Professional drivers That is what we need Professional drivers because US citizens spend way too much time on the roads to justify the reckless stupid driving that is the rule not the exception,
If somebody is tailgating you you should move over Especially if theres a ton of cars piling up behind you,
Yeah I hog the left lane Fight me I will also speed up and block you if you try to pass me lmao,
I dont intent to slow traffic in the left lane because I also want to go faster however some cars have more HP than others and that can trick the speed limit,
Its should be legal to rear end left lane campers and not have to stop lol,
Another thing to add the Left Lane is for DRIVING DRIVING PEOPLE NOT CHECKING YOUR EMAIL FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM at 35mph Thank you,
Just look at the swiss people And german people we are doing great,
I was so confused until I realised this applied to American Roads,
Well I think the traffic law shoulnt be handled by state especially for roads which connect to another state and especially highways this should be a federal law,
Left lanes are for passing Period,
People who dont get this and say well just go the speed limit are THE WORST Its like they watched the video and retained 0 information,
also in Germany France and Switzerland especially CH it is illegal to pass on the right,
Finally Left lane is designed for faster speed because left lane driver are not constantly changing the lanes Left lane is for medianlong road trip drivers,
In Germany we have the RECHTSFAHRGEBOT to prevent these dangerous situations,
driving is bad for the environment,
This is common knowledge in the UK,
Interstate 5 drivers from San Francisco to Los Angeles listen up,
Stay in the right lane if you are driving a turtle,
How did you not know slow traffic isnt supposed to drive in the left lane I thought that was common knowledge,
People dont even know what it means when someone flashes their lights at you anymore Good luck with this,
arent people taught to drive this way in the US in the uk this is just normal and everyone does it,
Agreed now they need to do something about something similar to this on 2lane roads,
Its so disheartening that people dont know what the left lane is for,
Im in UK and im confused,
its absoluetly normal in europeleft lane is for fast driving overtakingmeanwhile right lane is for slow drivers and when you finish overtaking,
Im kind of amazed that anyone would even think to make a video about this Anyone with a drivers license should know that the left lane is for going faster because its literally part of drivers ed And common sense,
If you drive the speed limit drive in the right lane,
Thats how our roads work in UK everyone is taught this,
Voxplained Brought to you by Captain Obvious Now with Flint water infused millenials,
Uh at first I was just super confused but then I realised that ur in America  drive in the other lane,
If you think you are within your rights to sit in the left lane because you are doing the speed limit you are WRONG It is NOT your responsibility to enforce the speed limit only to drive SAFELY to your destination If you are blocking the left lane because you think you are being a hero YOU are breaking the law and are part of the problem,
I been trying to tell people this for years Thank you for the video hope you dont mind but I posted it to Facebook,
Amen  Keep to the right,
Ok but can they really be mad that tie hanging in the left lane going 30 over,
I cant help but note deviation from average speed Quality bit of data interpretation there where the dumbed down for quick political gain would be speed kills Now on that point even keeping to the rightleft dependent on country has a drawback being slower drivers who are not consistently slow Youre in a commercial motor on a speed limiter someone in the incorrectly titled slow lane is going slower than you So you pull out to overtake the driver then speeds up and you cannot get past That has caused all sorts of issues in my many years of driving usually as they merely match your speed when you were doing 10mph more comfortably This leaves the issue of sitting there vs slowing down and trying to drop in behind them And often slowing down is not a choice because of a stack of vehicles behind you or no space behind the suddenly accelerating car because of other cars The result is a queue and the blame gets levied on the poor sod in a commercial motor,
This means two things 1 American driving lessons are absolutely terrible 2 Youre not the type of person whos ever looked in his rearview mirror,
GERMANY,
We need this enforced in Washington state Ive never see a left lane hog get pulled over in 9 years,
Do a video on why ppl get into the left lane and go 10 miles slower than everyone else,
Who knew Christophe not only has a beautiful voice but also a beautiful face 031,
Very informative Next do a video about how people should always remember to breathe,
THANK YOU,
Driving too slow on the left lane Yeah stupid drivers,
I live in California and they didnt teach us this is Drivers Ed Glad I know now,
In Britain we drive on the left you keep to the left unless you are overtaking It sounds bizarre to allow slow drivers to hog the fast lane,
I refuse to believe americans are so stupid they dont know why there are multiple lanes,
204 OXNARD police Nice,
999 of people in australia know to use the secondary lane to overtake I always thought that was the point of them,
If I became a CHP officer Id increase state revenue tenfold by ticketing drivers going slow in the left lane lol,
This really confused me because Im from the UK and over here the left lane on the motorway is the normal slower lane and the others are overtaking lanes I didnt realise it was American,
It also work with escalators same concept,
What not to do at a Stop Light The,
Thats like in nz there are 3 lanes 1 slow 2 medium 3 fast,
Lol way to encourage the stereotype I always assumed that people who drove slowly in the left hand lane would be the kind of people who write for Vox and now thats been confirmed ,
Im a pretty new driver and only been driving for about 4 months so far so this is helpful,
Vox we drive on the right side of the road in America not on the left side of the road,
*Cough *Cough California Higway commuters,
Dang my state does not care about left lane hogsthey were not highlighted at all in the video as a state that reinforced slow left lane drivers lol,
I need all Indonesians to watch this video specifically those who use JABODETABEKCIPULARANG highway,
Because its illegal Greets from Germany,
Wait hang on a minuteyou can pass on the right in some parts of the US German drivers arent just more likely to use the left for overtaking only because of the lack of a speed limit but also because passing on the right is AGAINST THE LAW EVERYWHERE IN EUROPE and is enforced Even when there are no cops you can expect to be honked at incessantly by justifiably angry drivers until you leave the left lane if youre slow,
Thats like drivers 101 in Germany,
This I drive nearly 400 miles 800 roundtrip to visit family twice a year and these slow leftlane drivers make me feel like Im going to have a stroke If the speed limit is 75mph why are you going 60 IN THE LEFT LANE If you are being passed by cars in the right lane be cool and switch lanes,
This whole thing is just stating the painfully obvious,
I dont think slow drivers will care if fast drivers want to take risks Older people here dont care and drive about 6570mph on the left lane,
tree benefit reform decrease guarantee continuous fail bright wealthy simultaneously president greatest impact,
Just do it like Germany,
In Hungary and I think in most of Europe its illegal to drive in the left lane when not overtaking it is very surprising that it is not common knowledge and enforced everywhere,
In Germany and generally in Europe you must go through a very extensive driving school before you can actually get a driver license People over there actually know how to drive share the road understand speed differences for each lane how to change lanes how to give enough room entering or exiting the high way etc While in the US driver licenses are being handed out to people who barely know how to steer a steering wheel and shift to D,
Who doesnt know this frfr stay out the left lane unless you want to pass someone,
In Austria you only use the left lane for passing or if there is a lot of traffic already,
The drivers training in Germany is also a lot more intensethorough,
Well actually according to the Highway Code the left lane is the driving lane and the right lane is the overtaking lane So this is wrong,
Dont Americans have to do a drivers license anymote nowadays,
So its official you have to speed in order to drive correctly Why even have speed limits if youre going to get in trouble either way People dont drive the speed limit regardless of the lane theyre in and now this says Whatever the societallyaccepted speed is in this area go faster in the left lane Also this feels like were enabling people to drive like maniacs impatient people whipping and weaving through traffic instead of just driving normally That guy in the example went out of his way to pass those two underestimated the gap and took out two people But then these guys say its the other guys faults for seemingly making him drive that way as if he had no other option I get that the left lane is only the passing lane but why is it also the speeding lane Im not trying to rant here but it gets pretty frustrating when youre trying to adhere to the speed limit and then no one on the road likes you but then you maintain the flow of traffic and now cops stop you because youre technically speeding according to the posted speed limit,
My sister drives like 20 mph What a noob,
This is obvious if youve been driving for at least a year,
it should be perfectly legal to PIT these people if they dont move,
23rds of these comments are HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THESE RULES WE WENT OVER THEM IN DRIVING SCHOOL AND THE EXAM But as you can see there is a lot of America that hasnt put this into law They should fix that,
Give people tickets for drivingcruising slowly in the passing lane,
Sharing the road with others puts me in a dark place called Satans bathroom,
It was one of the first rules that knew when I first start driving here in saudi,
I seriously cant understand why at 033 the left lane driver is the only one at fault Apparently the passing driver literally would rather die than deign to slow down for a few seconds,
In Canada the left is called a passing lane and the right is for prolonged movement Basically the same thing,
I only sit in the left lane when I am coming up on a car but I pay close attention behind me to see if someone wants to pass me,
Its forbidden to be in the right lane if youre not overtaking somebody,
I have never driven a car myself but when Im in a car with my parents or something I just think its logical to drive faster in the left lane and slower in the right lane,
Easy solution Make it illegal to stay in the outside lane if youre not overtaking Thats the law in a lot of European countries and faced with the prospect of200ish fines most people will just go back to the inside lane as soon as possible Oh and while youre at it also make undertaking illegal because having that be allowed is just mental,
Speed is 55 You can go faster if you want Just get into the left lane and if they pull you for speeding just say you were just trying to pass everyone,
Finally someone said something about this Im tired of People going 10 under the speed limit in the passing lane,
This is what I say to the fast drivers just slow down,
I got so confused but then I realised this would be American,
This is my biggest pet peeve,
In the uk we do that but the faster driving lane is the right one and the motorways have 3 lanes for different driver speeds,
Isnt this common knowledge,
Driving in the left lane for too long here in the netherlands can get you a fine for about 120,
Hahaha as a driver in Australia the title confused me at first,
You realise everyone in the rest of the world knows this Why is the US the only industrialised country where they dont Its not only obvious but its fundamental in how roads work and should be explained when you learn to drive if you dont do it automatically,
In Singapore they only have slower drives on the left lane not the right,
In my country left lane should drive slow and right lane are fast,
In australia at least in my state anywhere where the speed limit is 80kmh the right lane is overtaking only but literally no one enforces it to the point of trucks and slow cars hogging every lane,
I cant wait to see what kind of mess it will be when they start adding self driving cars,
Is this something thats not known about in it US Here in the UK this is just common knowledge Im 17 and Ive been aware of this for years and we get upset about people driving in the middle lane on threelane roads,
The California Driver Handbook says the following If you choose to drive slower than other traffic do not drive in the Number 1 Lane When another driver is close behind you and wishes to drive faster you should move to the right Sure we all want to obey the speed limit But what would you do when all lanes are blocked by sidebyside traffic driving 5 mph below speed limit And what would you do when only number 1 lane is available while others are blocked by traffic 1 mph above speed limit Think the number 1 lane as the express lane in the grocery store the cashier will still take you if you have more items but standing in the express lane But we will want to keep the express lane available for the people in need and qualified Same thing for driving on the road we can make the traffic smoother by doing better than the law requires,
Does it apply for motorcycle ,
Just like in escalators today Walk on the left stand on the right,
This video is meaningless for those of us in the UK,
The crashes arent caused by the slow people though Its because of the people who are changing lanes,
Interesting this is the way it just works in Finland dont think we have a law for it,
File this under duh,
I usually drive at least double the speed limit and only use the right lane for backing up,
People in Texas have to be the worst drivers I loathe people that camp in the left lane,
Is this worth a video Do people really not know this This is like lesson 2 in driving school,
Also in Germany on the Autobahn its iirc totally forbidden to pass others from the right unless totally unavailable like in a traffic jam,
This happens in El Salvador,
Ah so reckless drivers are more likely to cause an accident So does that mean you cant be done for speeding in the left lane if no one else is on the road or if everyone is speeding,
I was so confused until I realised the US drive the other way,
We dont have this problem in Portugal its like one of the first things they teach us in driving school,
people travelling slowly on the first lane is the reason for my road rage episodes,
In Europe its prohibited to overtake on the right lane,
Most accidents happen during lane changes go figure,
On Texas highways we have signs all down the highways telling everyone to get out of the left lane,
The left lane is for passing and moving over for cars to get onto the highway from a ramp That is it,
Because the right lane is for overtaking and youre all driving on the wrong side of the bloody road D,
If you have a license you should know this,
People drive 5 below on highways I drive about 2025 above and stay in the middle or left lane so I can keep that speed,
I had a hard time believing that there were 2700 people giving the video a Thumbs Down to sensible advice But these are likely the idiots who camp in the Left lane,
You have to drive right in Germany,
The problem is that you dont have adequate training before being let loose on the roads You are allowed to drive at age 16 We have something called L17 in Austria allowing you to drive at age 17 Here is the process involded in attaining your license for you compare You can start at age 15 and a half 32 hours of theoretical education then write a test 30 fail Complete a 6 hour first aid course If you pass both you will have 12 hours of driving with an instructor Then you have to drive 3000km 1850miles with one of your parents as your passenger after every 1000km you have to drive with an instructor again and talk about your progress and what you have to improve upon After you did your 3000km you have another 6 hours of theory and another 3 hours of driving with an instructor The day you turn 17 you can take your driving test consisting of questions on your knowledge of a car checking fluids brakes tires serpentine belt and so on as well as function of all the buttons inside the car Plus the meaning and how to react to warning lights or other mechanical issues Parking and a small parcour and then your drive out on the road All in all this takes about an hour Another 20 fail 24 months after getting your license you have 2 sessions per 50 minutes of driving with an instuctor and talking about your driving skills and where to improve further 39 months after getting your license you have a road safety training where you will learn to control your vehicle in extreme situations emergency stops swerving to avoid obstacles reaction training low friction surface braking oversteer and understeer plus a group discussion with a road safety psychologist Takes about 89 hours 612 months after getting your license you have another 2x 50 min with an instructor same as before That was the last thing to complete now you have 3 years of probation from the moment you got your license not the second stage with a strict zero tolerance on alcohol and harder punishments that can lead to you losing your license,
This should be mandatory viewing every month,
Pretty common thing in West Europe even by law in some countries,
Yes At a family gettogether my sister mentioned she had gotten a ticket for driving in the left lane on the freeway She voiced her opinion that she thought it was unfair since she was going the speed limit I knew the law about left lane for passing but my response was part amazement and part joy because someone actually got caught and got a ticket And I told her YAY Sorry sis but drivers hogging the fast lane drive me crazy I am glad you got a ticket,
My problem with this is if the speed limit is 70 and everybody is going 85 I do not want to speed so what do I go as fast as the traffic or the speed limit,
The fact that people need to be told this is worrying,
Cant wait for the next Vox videos Green light means go and The right pedal makes the car go faster,
You woiulkd not never mov over if u don hav too Causemerica,
People who speed and weave between cars are 100000000000000000000000000000 x worse than left lane drivers,
People dont understand that if I am walking and say excuse me they would move Now in a car if I HGH beam you that is excuse me so move Why be stubborn and try and prove a point Then you get the ones that tap their breaks They love to play games when they feel safe behind a wheel More accidents are created my these issues Pay attention when driving and stay in your LANE,
Freakin semirucks tractor trailer always cut me off,
Say you are european,
Main frankly employment blow liability unable describe fifteen root general commander inside,
Yesit is the rule that you should stick to the rightthe left lane is for faster driving vehicles and for passing BUT here is the problem There always is going to be someone else driving faster than you You might be driving slightly faster than the rest of traffic so you might think its OK to be in the left lane to pass other cars So you get over to the left and instantly here comes someone rushing up on your bumper No matter how fast you are going you are always going to have someone thinking its a car race and try to pass you If the speed limit is 50 and you are doing 60 you will have a string of jerks who want to do 70 If you speed up to 70 you will have people wanting to do 80 and so on It never ends It is like a chain reaction No matter how fast you speed up it makes everyone else want to go faster than you If you get over to the left to pass another car it makes everyone else in back of you do the same If someone is in the right lane going very slow when you pass them the cars in back of you are going to do the same plus attempt to pass you as well even though you were not the problem They will not simply pass the first car they will stay over to the left and floor it attempting to pass every car in sight even though those cars are already speeding,
Isnt it your overtaking lane Thats how it works,
Im a very fast driver I will pass you on the emergency lane if I have to,
Yay for Joey Move it or lose it,
Isnt this taught when you learn to drive I know in UK it is And in most countrys its law aswell,
I always drive in the left lane but encounter no problem It is because cars in my place drive in left not right,
Thank you for this video,
Even if it IS law in NY I would typically encounter a slow driver in the left lane whether it was on city roads or the thruway Since moving to NH it has improved and makes a big difference in the flow of traffic but from time to time it still happens,
In Australian its stay left unless over taking My mind was going haywire trying to decode this video lol,
they need to enforce this in California where you are constantly having to keep any eye on all the cars that weave in and out of lanes BECAUSE they are trying to pass all of those slow drivers in the left lane Its needlessly stressful because slow folks insist on staying in the left lane,
The left lane is for slower car Make it right,
Left is fast and slow is right is how you drive in Florida well besides braking in front of people at the last second,
This is interesting an all but I cant drive yet Cya,
the rules are opposite in places like New Zealand if you want to overtake somebody you go on the right lane,
The reason Germany can have the Autobahn is because its 10x harder to get a license over there The driving tests here in the states are a joke compared to some European countries Our whole process takes as little as six months whereas countries like Germany and Finland take anywhere from 12 years and its a lot more expensive 1000 Their fail rates are actually a lot lower than US but a lot less people taking the test per capita,
Plot twist when youre on the highway everyones driving fast legally 70 is top speed fastness Of course driving 65 on the left is rude dumb and i can see how it can deserve recourse legally but to say a person going 7075 is slow and dangerous only makes an excuse for those overtly aggressive drivers theyre the ones that make roads dangerous,
Exactly Get the  out of the way,
PLEASE show this to everyone in Georgia,
I experienced the first hand experience of using left lane only for Lane change and in my one drive on motorwayhighway in Poland I saw two accidents and i could really witness potential accident scenarios multiple times The issue here is if people use left lane only to pass we are not sure when a particular person going to come into left lane and its leading to multiple lane changes I can see people going back and forth into left lane and right lane which is really dangerous I prefer US style of driving using left lane for fast traffic and as we move away from divider the speed reduces gradually Keeping left lane only to pass is too dangerous,
So lets condone illegal activity to let people drive above the limit,
I hate when cars in multiple lanes are driving at the same speed thus preventing passing,
In Germany you are not only supposed to drive right except to pass youre also not allowed to pass on the right side The combination makes it safe Also we are not driving like 120mph all the time When I visit my parents some 162 miles away I average a speed of 83mph door to door with a bit of driving through the city at the start and the end,
What I do if I see a left lane hogger is keep my left indicator on so I can let them know I want to pass and then some move over and some dont PS STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE EXCEPT WHEN OVERTAKING this message is for all the Americans that dont know the rules of the road And dont even get me started on how Americans dont know how to use roundabouts,
Let me explain why the German Autobahn works without speed limits and accident rates are low The Autobahn is generally maintained very well in the first place second on those stretches that actually are without speed limits drivers do not only tend to keep right unless they are passing but they also drive extremely cautiously when they pass This is due to the fact that you dont want to get rearended by someone driving 160mph in the left lane while you switch into it with 80mph So not only does the lack of a speed limit tend to get drivers to keep right it also forces them to switch lanes extremely cautiously opposed to what can be observed in many other countries This means that the drivers have to stay focused similarily to a situation in which you try to find way in a big unknown city,
I was about to sayEurope has been doing this thing for a very long time but as always america is a decade behind,
If you have relatively slow drivers on the left and right drivers have to swerve to pass you maybe just dont try and go that fast You dont swerve you dont cause an accident,
I cant believe the guy is so surprised this is obvious and standard anywhere in Europe,
Keep right unless to pass isnt universal This is news,
Common sense presented by vox,
Im surprised this isnt taught in US driving schools In Europe this is pretty much the norm and if you go slow you will get tailgated until you understand you should move over,
Dear Ohioans please watch this 5 times in a row and GTFO the left lane Sincerely your Kentucky neighbor,
Personally I dont drive in the far left lane so I dont get hit by oncoming traffic,
Isnt this common sense In Germany we have the Rechtsfahrgebot It means Drive on the freaking right lane if there is room to do so ,
In Europe left lanes are reserved for overtaking its unlikely but you should be fined if you stay in left lanes,
Its so they dont leave fingerprints at the murder scene,
So they cant find fingerprints when they *TOUCHA YOUR SPAGHET*,
Hands are just hard to draw,
I always thought that the cartoon birds didnt wear gloves because the fingers are technically their feathers taking shape of hands and fingers as opposed to having paws,
Thumbs up if you are old enough to have used videotapes,
Okay but what we really needa be asking is does Mike Wazowski blink or wink,
I went to Disney and asked Mickey that question He says it makes him look stylish,
I also noticed that Pinocchio had 4 fingers on each hand as a puppet but then has 5 fingers when he becomes a boy,
123 V E R Y S P A G H E T,
When you find out Mickey Mouse is loosely based off of Blackface minstrel shows Chilllll staywoke,
*So they can get away with murder*,
*Mickey Mouse is a nonhuman doing very human things* 226 *He looks at the camera* Why am I suddenly afraid and sense danger,
There is nothing funnier than the Human Animal Walt Disney,
Wait that is a collar around his neck,
So Mario isnt a human ,
Why do Bird cartoon characters not wear gloves Uhhhhh DUUUUHHHHHHH they dont have HANDS LADY Their wingsfeathers become armsfingers when they portray more human mannerisms but when they fly they *generally* morph back to wings,
I feel like Mickey shouldve never changed He was more appealing in the old style,
Welp the guy who chugs cheeze whiz broke the 4th wall,
I finally watched this YouTube Are you happy now,
Daffy duck wore chokers before it was cool,
Ok thanks now I know why they wear gloves but WHO TOUCHA MY SPAGHET,
Theory The birds dont wear gloves because they dont have amrs per se They have wings Giving Daffy gloves would make him look like a weird quadruped with a beak,
And lets not get into the four finger and three toe thing,
Daffy Duck been wearing chokers before chokers were even a thing,
I leaned about the face paint thing on the actors at school It was a part of Jim Crow of course Jim Crow went on for many years dating back to almost the 17th century and ending around the 60s Whites used to stereotype and rumor that African Americans were mischievous and that they were savages This led to the whites making movies merchandise and tv shows trashing the reputations of all African Americans That is why the faces are painted The things white Americans did back then were such despicable actions,
So it all started with racism like America wich is still racist ok,
Birds dont wear gloves cause their arms are actually wings and their fingers are actually feathers it would be hard to fly with gloves on your wings,
Because the animator couldnt draw fingers,
I think the main reason for using gloves in cartoons and in vaudeville was because it made it easier for the audience to see where their hands were and what their hands were doing,
I had a feeling wed be going down the minstrel wormhole in this episode The preminstrel tension was too much,
Hands ARE hand to draw But using gloves just change the color of there hand its still hands,
easy so they dont leave fingerprints on the murder scene,
Possible practical reason gloves help keep their fur away from everything including their food  Possible animation reason it allows the viewer to see what the hands are doing especially if a character has a complexion dark enough to unwillingly hide the individual fingers Also 4 fingers are much easier to animate than 5 fingers and doesnt take away from what the hands are doing,
Mario and Sonic wears Gloves,
because finger anatomy takes so damn much time to get right,
Cus the hand fetish nibbas would go hecking wild You see what happened with Sonic they want his shoes off,
Now answer why Porky Pig doesnt wear pants,
Lmao why are always wearing gloves Bobby classic XD,
Wow I wasnt prepared to see Bugs without his gloves on,
*There all*  *Cartoons* *Only the Mouse nose*,
So mickey wears gloves because racism Good to know,
A better question Why dont they wear pants,
Walt Disney created racist works back then songs of the south It comes straight from vaudeville and blackface performances,
Daffy Duck wears that thing around his neck because hes really a Catholic priest,
cartoons kill your kids mind so they wear gloves not to leave finger prints behind,
Why do people pronounce Professor like perfesser,
Follow up question Why Cartoon Character has only 4 Fingers,
Poor Bobby became self aware and was never seen again,
they obviously wear gloves to hide their fingerprints easier when they murder children,
444 Wait wait wait so youre telling me that that isnt a pattern attached to his body Waitis it a *C h o k e r*,
the answer to the question litterally no one has ever asked,
028 already throwing gang signs up in this b,
Mickey looks shocked when he tried to blow himself up but turned black instead,
Lets be real people Daffy Duck brought back the choker,
Remember when Bobby said that and he never showed up again after that,
A So they wont get their hands dirty B Hands are hard to draw C So they wont leave a fingerprint after murdered someone D All of the above,
You never actually answered the question,
Could it also be that the ANIMATORS themselves often wore gloves to protect their hands from wear and tear etc THANKS Great Question,
Cause there hands are cold,
Becuase theyre all psychopaths who need to make sure they dont leave behind fingerprints,
Not only cartoon characters wear White Gloves but also Video game character like Mario,
HahaI was waiting for Bugs to appear D,
Goofy without gloves was weird as hell oo,
Kim Dotcom Caught in the Web 2017 deleted by cia  says private watched anyway on Free site lol pmsl good movie,

I been knew this because way back when they first started making mickey mouse when everything was white and black you couldnt see the characters had if they put it on there skin or stomach so they made them wear gloves and they liked it so just kept it,
They are self conscious because they have herpes on their hands,
Vox always manages to make the coolest videos Keep it up Vox,
Why cartoon characters wear gloves Jay Z  The Story of OJ,

Its basically a much easier way of drawing hands,
To those of you complaining that they mentioned racismhave you ever seen song of the south,
15 Lines of introduction and Conclusion to a 1 line Answer Feels like English Exam,
Story writers asking animators to put gloves on the characters hmm,
229 He is anthromorphic,
Waiting for something to write a Creepypasta on this topic,
Gloves serve two primary purposes They allow characters with black bodies to have their hands visible when their hands are in front of them and they draw emphasis to the the expressions of the hands The emphasis on expression is the same reason why mimes paint their faces white Simple as that,
because hands are considered NSFW in the animated world,
Did OJ Simpson wear gloves ,
tldw anthropomorphism and expediency,
Does Mike Wazowski blink or wink,
Finally a video that isnt about Trump or the political US,

If you play jazz behind anything it sounds brilliant Today were going to talk about farts *bass riff muted trombone*,

My original thought after reading the title was Because drawing hands is seriously difficult,
It would be weird to put gloves on what are technically wings,
Before I clicked this I thought wow this video looks so weird and pointless I was right,
What about Oswald the Lucky Rabbit THERE IS A CERTAIN RABBIT MISSING,
Ducks  birds dont have hands thats why they dont wear gloves in cartoons,
When I draw people I always have their hands behind their backs because I always fail at doing hands,
To save time from  deciding what theyd look like the amount of detail they would have what color they would be,
I love how the level of consciousness the characters have about the gloves and other stuff about their appearance,
A Goofy Movie is a cult classic I say BS on this subjective idea,
Because Toons are always Jerking Off,
Visual contrast and visibility The eyes have it,
Birds have wings how you going to put gloves on wings,
Of course its a stoner who thinks the truly deeply philosophical thoughts I swear Master Yoda was always absolutely torched during council meetings meditating eating sleeping training Yeah all the time,

1000OK if I sleep now I get a solid 8 hours of sleep 3 am,

i always thought its just because they wanted it to be like that and not have certain meaning to it ,
White gloves are more aesthetic as well Mario Sonic Roger Rabbit,
I was surprised to hear about the Vaudeville comparisonI didnt even know,
Ive gotta admit drawing gloves vs hand is the same difficulty If anything youd be saving 1 min of details with a glove,
They learned from OJ,
who else kept hearing Vodkafilled,
Can you explain why the person that picks up the drink while hes asking that is NOT wearing any gloves lol,
Who else forgot about the hint around Daffys neck,
I like wearing gloves but I aint an animation Or am I,
Its pretty obvious that bird characters dont wear gloves because their arms are supposed to be their wings,
The videos Vox make are just top quality the sound effects the choosing of proper clips and the colors and the entire process of video making I want to applaud those who are behind these works nice job,
Bugs Because its who I am Why do you use the thing around your neck anyway Daffy Duck *touches the white neck thing with a worried expression on face* Me good point Bugs Good Point,
Not convincing at all Another strange thing common to old animal comics  why do they all have 4 fingers rather than 5 ,
About birdbased characters not wearing gloves i think that maybe because their wings are used as hands and feathers are made to look like fingers,
Now why are female anthropomorphic animals fully clothed when sometimes the males arent,
Seeing Bugs Bunny without gloves was very surreal,
Thought youd figure out a way to bring race into this but good job with the informative vid Edit so close vox so close,
You got another subscriber Team You deserve it ___,
Pretty interesting and cool stuff thanks for the upload again ,
I dont think Ive heard the answer before but quick guess is makes animation cheaper means they can use the same cells for other characters and save an assload of time animating hands which most people hate drawing at all,
Its great that you interviewed the guy through a macdonalds drive speaker,
Homer Simpson does not wear them,
birds dont have the gloves cause they dont have front feetpaws i guess,
the bird guy should have said because if i dont*takes it off* *head falls off*,
y u no reveal yer face ,
I think bird characters dont use gloves because their hands also represent their wings,
bc they are easy to draw,
Look its the leaning tower of Cheeza,
Do Why is Vox always trending,
Hey Vox you should really balance out your audio,
Goofy without his gloves is just WIERD ,
gloves also makes them more civilized psychologically more like you the viewer is the player,
Draw a glove on a bird wing as birds wings are still pretty wing like a lot of time as opposed to arms,
Vox **makes yet another good video** Conservatives How can I make this about me tho,
Well of course gloves on wings would not be very aerodynamic Solved,
at 207 plane crazy was released in 1928 not 1927,

P R O T E C T I O N,
AND HER HAND GETS STUCK IN THE,
The wear gloves so they dont get cheese spray on their hands Like duh,
I did the same thing for this animation project I had it was just easier because you dont have to be exact with it you just draw it up real quick and it looks good,
TLDR Hands are hard to draw,
Wow I never thought of that before so true lol,
i feel like im playing cuphead right nowim so addicted,
That bendy is not a disney character he wears gloves too,
You know how much of a pain it is to draw knuckles Just google knuckles it takes forever to find a good picture first try you get a sonic character second try you get a humanoid version of a sonic character and your third try you get normal knuckles,
Why do Mickeys ears always face the viewer,
is this a *real question* people ask themselves is this question on the mind of ANYONE are there people in the world going around asking their fellow mankind WHY DO CARTOON CHARACTERS WEAR GLOVES do better VOX,

THE NARRATOR SAID DAMN AS A SJW I AM OUTRAGED ,
Even before I clicked on this video I was thinking of Goofy taking his glove off in Goofy and Wilbur,
Male mallard ducks have a white band of feathers around their necks I think thats what Daffy has,
All they needed to say was that it was labor intensive but they manage to make a 5 minute video on gloves in cartoons,
Because birds dont have hands and you cant put freaking gloves on wings,
I really hate old animations They make me feel super uncomfortable,
I just thought the gloves where apart of the style,
021 Why do we always wear pant,
251 elder kettle from cuphead,
I always just thought that was the style back then Cause it was common to see people wear them,
Why does Donald Trump wear orange foundation Questions we cannot answer,
I found thw answer to the questio it is They ARE COLD,
Well that was an interesting question I never asked myself,
Why did I laugh so hard at Bobby asking about his gloves,
damn that was a good one,
I know why Pinocchio only has gloves as a puppet Its because hes made of wood and the gloves make it so he doesnt give anyone a splinter when giving a handshake And makes his punching less painful,
252 CUPHEAD,
Vox can actually make a video that doent not involve slaming presfient trump,
Explain Mario and Sonic wearing gloves,
It also makes it easier to identify what side of the hand is being shown if its plain youre looking at the palm but if it has those little stripes youre looking at the top of the hand,
440 I always thought that daffy was a sort of dark mallard duck which would explain the white collar Edit Wow thanks for the likes ,
Then I guess 4 fingers were a middle ground between the complexity of 5 and the abstraction of only 3 or less,
At 017 I was just about to say in the second goofy movie Max friend asked the same question,
Whats the name of the Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck skit at the end,
I think birds dont have gloves because they have wings,
Mandela Effect Tinkerbell is no where in the old Disney Intros I remember her flying over creating the rainbow with pixie dust and dotting the I She is no where to be seen,
Hygiene obviously,
006 Whats that,
No but I have cheese wiz Ryan Ross,
The simple answer is gloves make drawing hands so much easier as they dont require too much detailing,
ohi thought their hands are ugly so they wear gloves or they dont have any and its floating gloves,
Now Im weirded out,
Dont forget sonicTails and Knuckles too because they also wear gloves,
Wow that was new to me especially the rubber hose  circle thing a total eyeopener Thank you,
What on earth is a VHS  12 year olds Im done,
TFW you have freaking awesome channel bro i want to watch every video cuz they have interesting title,
Umm Tom and jerry dont,
Watch The Big Lez show First season made in MS Paint D,
They wear gloves to avoid finger prints on door knobs n stuff Especially Disney characters who like to break into childrens bedrooms,
I dont care if they wear gloves all I care about is how creepy old Disney cartoons were,
Everything is racist Thats teh answer huh Vox,
Never thought I would learn a lesson in contrast So Thank You My Art will be better for it,
Bobby is from the movie Encino Man,
Its the weeeasal,
This video mentioned VHS in 2017 Let that sink in for a moment ,
236 entire point video in 3 seonds,
Obviously because it reads better than dark furry hands Duh,
duh the birds do not wear gloves because they have WINGS No arms no hands no gloves needed They cant fly with those things on lol,
A finger bends in two places so three parts A gloved finger just curves so far easier to draw,
Bird characters dont wear gloves because those arent hands but wings,
014 NO BUT I GOT CHEEZ WHIZ,
Easy Daffy and Tweety are birds so gloves would impede their flight,
Lmao theyre cold,
Bird wings wouldt really work if they had gloves on them,
That thing is a Pearl Necklace given to Daffy by his Grand Mama you uncultured mammalian,
You can watch the movie on Netflix with better graphics,
Its all about freemasons Disney had a 33 degree by the way,
That last moment when you hear that daffy is wearing a choker lmao,
310,
I think the reason why bird cartoon characters werent designed with gloves was because their actual wings were made into the form of arms and hands and it would look too strange for their wings to have gloves on them At least I think thats the reason I dont know thats just what Im assuming,
Or they just are wearing cloves cause its cold outside,
Mm I always wondered,
My boy relaxingend where you at,
For some reason when that guy started talking at first I thought it Donald Trump,
A lot of people are asking why the characters only have 4 fingers and the answer is at 239 right after the highlighted text,
My question is why does sonic and Mario wear gloves,
Me going into the video Is this going to be a hidden dark secret thing Me coming out of the video I have been watching too much Film Theory,
oh my wordthats actually really cool,
the legend27 never wears gloves,
Birds need their wings to fly,
As an artist I can confirm that hands are absolutely dreadful,
207 it was 1928 ok not 1927,
amazing this is so well everythinged,
Many animated birds dont use gloves because well they are birds those are not even paws those are wings and feathers being used as hands And that thing around Daffy Ducks neck are white feathers present in the males of some species of mallards wild ducks those that are hunted on season,
Because gloves dont look good on birds,
I already know why but college humour amirite,
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO TURN TO A RACE THING,
its so theyre fingerprints dont get on their weapons,
Why dont most characters not wear pants or shirts,
I remember that episode where Goody took off his glove and I was shook,
I remember when artists drawing four fingers than five fingers To save time of drawing Some still do,
BUGS BUNNY SAVAGE,
Cant believe im watching vox but here we go,
Lets not forget about sausage party ,
If you ever see oswald the lucky rabbit on anything he still does not have glove cause they wanna keep him original,
Watch next Why does the US 800 military bases all around the world httpbitly2B3IiFx,
The Americans are a very lucky people Theyre bordered to the north and south by weak neighbors And to the east and west by fish Otto Von Bismarck,

Before watching the video  Easy answer The US took advantage of the power vacuum left by the crumbling British Empire,
America Ill be the biggest super power forever China hold my factory India hold my cheap labour,
American I love America Europeans *ACSHUALLY*,
Hi random scroller,
I think what people fail to realize is that if America goes down then its most likely taking the economy with it,
it all started with a couple of libertarian rebels with hunting rifles and taxes they didnt want,
why cnat vox make more of these videos instead of their social justice propaganda,
Sounds more like a propaganda tool than a history video The narrator keeps on trying to sell the idea that USA interfering in other countries affair is a good thing for the world,
find out in the next season of america,
A little ticked about how they dont have the correct US map by leaving out us buying the last of Arizona and completing the map Gotta support my state,
It was pretty much ww1 and ww2 right Most of the major powers before both of the world wars were concentrated within Europe Ie Britain France Germany The world wars destroyed their economies hence Americas relative wealth increased but Americas overall wealth increased via lending money and selling resources to the European allies  consequently America ushered in its current state of economic prosperity It also had a brilliant geographical land base at the time  looooaads of resources to sell to warring countries,
I think USA has been the least tyrant of the superpowers history has ever witnessed World is still not in a perfect place but USA is a country you can deal with unlikethepast super powers,
I agree with trump that we need to stop getting involved with peoples problems and fix our own because its just causing us more problems,
Use these 10 quick tricks to become a superpower in only 200 years number 7 will blow you away,
Here more important the people isnt corrupt smart and hardworker,
The thing about power is it never lasts everyone gets their comeuppance soon or later,
WOW Im VERY IMPRESSED by this 9 min video that offers a remarkably good perspective on the development of the USA into the worlds superpower,
*_McKinley_* was *assassinated* in 1901 *_one of four_* US presidents to be assassinated *_Lincoln Garfield McKinley and Kennedy_* Pretty sad we dont teach US history as well as we should shown by the fact that hardly any young person today knows that,
You missed the last red and white bar on the flag at 822 There are 13 for the original 13 colonies but I only see 11,
223 America is sexy milf  Hope i find something  Rule 34,
Because of innovation hardwork and FREEDOM,
327 possessions what is it with America not wanting to admit it ever had any colonies,
One day my native country of Antarctica will become the World Superpower One day One day,
*Vox*  America is the worlds most influential super power and rose to the top through its spending on military and foreign relations *Me*  Thank you Vox very cool *Also Vox at the very end of the video*  Orange man bad *Me*  ,
USA is great country They are determined people They dont have laid back attitude,
UK we are the greatest empire never exist WE ARE IMMORTAL USA hold my beer,
wow no mention of the Atlantic slave trade and how it greatly influenced the industrial revolution Cheap labour without pay cotton and tobacco farming in the 16th and 17th centuries allowed for the revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries America Britain and their cohorts used slave labour to produce consumer goods for world trade during the 17th 18th and early 19th centuries,
I thought it was bitten by a radioactive spider or something,
Real reason *Because MURICA*,
This slaughter was not caused by guns but with famine,
Through the Masons aka Illuminati military like alien organization The alienIlluminati gave them weapons,
My country is a world super power 0 20th,
How to become a superpower Dont have a global war on your soil twice in 40 years Just keep building no rebuilding  make money doing that for others instead,
Vox managed to for once not be a hard bias still a little biased though,
100 years has gone by and USAs politics hasnt changed a bit Strange,
Somebody should be the global police to prevent next world war,
Usa lose in vietnam war,
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said Democracy is two wolves and a sheep arguing whats for dinner Liberty is a well armed lamb,
Proud to be an American,
Yall getting this wrong The great Wakanda is no doubt the most powerful,
Thank God for the Lend Lease Act Thanks Britain we love ya ,
Let set up a Elie of Elite Project to Execute Mega Social Restructure within max 7 years with clear KPIs set,
As a geography geek the lack of Gadsden Purchase is horribly distracting,
He got steroids and a frisbee shield Thats how,
Back to America when it didnt have enough *FREEDOM*,
Soon you can see India as a super power county,
I dont mind that they pursue their interests its legitimate as a nation What bothers me is that many think that they are helping other countries because theyre the nicest guys on earth,
Its like playing Civ on easy difficulty,
It WAS CONFLICT THE WHOLE TIME TO THIS DAY  DAMN LIARS  justice served,
Trade negotiation presence capitalism Democracy and amazing innovation is how,
NATO isnt just there for protection its making them money too stealing goods making sure trades go alright send them information,
But they cant switch to metric,
I find it intriguing how the USA literally started from the bottom after breaking away from Britain and soon over 200 years they rose up and became one of the most powerful countries In the world when back then no one thought they would last not even Britain,
What is he music on the back ground Thank you for the reply ,
Low levels of conflict why lie not even 2mins into the video  clearly the one speaking isnt of any Negro descent,
low level of conflicts seriously VOX,
Consumerism is the power of America nothing else ,
They didnt suffer economic ruin during ww2 because they didnt get bombed,
The United States is a Republic not a Democratic nation,
Talks about how USA became a superpower doesnt talk about the war against Mexico,
Video title should be How America became mystery Babylon,
Wow I had a serious focused face watching until I hear trump voice still one of the best jokes,
LOL unprecedented prosperity for banksters Ask the YellowVestInThe Street how prosperous they feel VoxLies,
FYI Sicily and Sardinia are regions of Italy,
Elizabeth Warrens ad at startan oxymoron Shes as corrupt as a politician can get,
Failed to answer the question The answer is that the two world wars were hugely profitable for the USA and transferred wealth and power from Europe to the USA,
Vox dont let this guy narrate any more videos Painful voice,
So proglobal politics is imperialism and isolationism is racismantiothercultures So imperialism is antiracism Alright US Its time to become more proimperialist Try and get Iceland and Greenland Than eventually integrate the idea of Israel joining us and see what well economic countries want to join us,
GOD BLESS AMERICA,
alliances LMAO,
Still not as powerful as Wakanda,
companies always want a surplus of workers to easly replace others  companies always want more worker than jobs,
The only thing I support trump with is dropping out of global affairs,
You just cant tell the democratic China from the communist one dont you,
The Beneficiaries of this Projext are current owners including European nations and native US citizen eg 250million people,

To go where no man has gone before And to do so boldly,
peacemaker,
Unprecedented prosperity and low levels of conflict are you living 1000000 light years away from earth which conflict doesnt USA has its fingers in,
Difcil ver o vdeo e perceber que toda influncia negativa estadunidense na Amrica latina fomentando governos autoritrios e capitalizando sobre a dvida externa de pases como Brasil Argentina e Chile que foram subjugados por regimes antidemocrticos foi ignorado na narrativa histrica de como os Estados Unidos da Amrica se tornaram a grande nao pacifista sobre a terra,
I dont always agree with your politics Vox but damn do you make some informative videos,
i liked and it went from 97k to 98 k,
It became a superpower when the rest of the superpowers were ruined by wars Thats all the wisdom,
And then came Trump Eff you NATO Eff you United Kingdom,
Translation for not United States citizens How the United States became a superpower,
TRUMP WHAT THE HELL YOU DOIN Famous last words,
The US Is foreign from America It also is a corporation Among many things The president is head of a corporation Kings rule countries and we are our own Kings unless you a 14th,
America became a superpower with the creation of Captain America,
Viva Espaa Ya es hora de que echemos a Podemos y al PSOE nimo Vox,
so is America an invisible Empire or I dare I say invisible by way of Empirilism 20 lessons from Rome,
well said Prosperity dominance american culture has influence so many countries in the world and is still a superpower Hope United States dont turn into Ancient Rome endless war Bread  Circus,
All good except didnt consider the ECHR and EU which were also instrumental and eventhough not the focus should have been mentioned I think otherwise the picture is less realistic and a little reductionist,
They became a superpower because the powerful European powers were too busy fighting each other and didnt care too much about America since its too far away,
By using Masonry against us like when they killed that breeder of Carrero Blanco rofl kek It was kinda based tho,
Talk about propaganda LOL,
This video and comments demonstrates what CIA Director William Colby had in mind when he said Well know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false ,
God bless and protect USA always,
I shocked that white men and racism werent said once in this whole video This is Vox right,
518 thats how political marketing works,
Ya forgot bout da Gadsden Purchase,
You lost me at unprocedented,
Make sure to say how colonizers murdered everyone in their way including my family,
The comments are made up of  50 European elitists  30 Discussion of the video  20 People saying america is a continent not a country,
America  U Meant The US,
America  U Meant The US,
theres only one side of this story of course,
345 The periodisation of ww2 on the chart is incorrect This is suggesting it took place from 194146 while it actually occured in 193945,

World Bank keeping us from going into another depression Propaganda Why dont you tell the truth,

Im mesmerized by the closing musical theme Listed as Colony by Elijah Barley Cant find it anywhere can anyone help,
I died when he said this lunatic in north korea,
How USA and not America wich is a F***ING CONTINENT became the biggest and worst Terrorist state in all of mankind History,
We cant think the Soviet Union a threat we keep the peace as a whole the elite have always been in control of labor through credit companies this effects America labor effects America its not all about THINKING ONE WAY,
Trumps greathis vision will benefit USA,
USA has just geological and political luck no strong neighbors and lots of resources,
Yall need some Freedom,
After The Central Bank was established,
The family of Rothchild And immigrants from Europe who settled in the New England region in the United States,
So short answer is by aggressive expansion and waging wars,
Before watching vid I guess bc the US has so much or more accurately gathered land mass materials and since the War of Independence no invasion to conquer the State was ever conducted,
LOW LEVELS OF CONFLICT,
I have to say Im glad American is prospering love from the UK,
U forgot to mention how Britain made America the superpower,
I really doubt that the US could become entirely an isolationist country,
Dammit Congress We shouldve taken Greenland,
And the Spanish has nothing to do uh Interesting,
I was going to tear this apart BUT its from 2016 not 2018,
So if were not expanding power intrusively into other nations amd creating globalist centralized power structures then its just an isolationist attempt to keep inferior races out of our country Just wow,
The name of our country is The United States,
Illustration is so pretty I hope Ill get that artistic sense,
This is incomplete without a mention of Petrodollar recycling the gold standard and how the dollar became the worlds reserve currency Those are the key points Without explaining those this presentation should not be considered anything more than a caricature of the history behind the American Empire,
The US prospered during the two world wars simply because they made an unbelievable fortune selling weapons to the allies and never had to play defense since the british invaded the US from Canada in the early 1800s This allowed them to make huge amounts of revenue and was never occupied or significantly damaged,
Finally vox says something thats actually true,
Guys lets remember that there are 3 branches in the government meaning that president Trump can not decide to do anything without 1 of the other branches,
Its easy to look today in the micro but when you study history going back to 70 BC and move forward it is a wild ride The Mongols for one,
You are eating your words mate Slow down,
Trump was angry because Macon want to leave NATO,
America will give prosperity if they get something put of it obviously,
1 Weapons sale 2 Causing wars in the world,
Sloppy Mapmaking Western Germany joined NATO in 1956 not 1991 and one of the Japanese islands was left out of the marking as Ally Wonder what Shikoku did to not get that role ,

Low levels of conflict LOL  thumbs down for propaganda,
start war between other countries and sell them weapons,
Thanks from Egypt,
Forgot to mention one of the key takeaways from Brettonwoods that helped the USA become a world power the USD became the reserve currency for every country on the planet,
USA USA,
You should keep using the best hardware at your disposal to compile the videos 357 700,
WW2 its no coincidence that Americas decline began when the rest of the world recovered from WW2 ,
You mean how USA became a superpower,
As a Russian the deeper I learn about the history of the USA the more fascinated I become about how interesting and complicated it is Americans truly should be proud of their country I wish Russia never fell in communist hell and stayed on democratic capitalist and european way of life,
My twoword summary for this video Manifest destiny,
I stopped watching as soon as he said Donald Trump,
This video is embarrassing to my non American countrytherefore Its wrong some people,

It was powerful because 1 It never suffered world war on its land 2 After world war it supply its allies with logisticand got paid for it 3 Lots of scientist run to USA during world war because its safer there 4 MURICA,
I could have sworn that the public outrage sparked by the USS Maine exploding in Havana Cuba is what dragged the US into the SpanishAmerica war The lovely William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer capitalized on the fact that the ship suddenly exploded while in a Spanish port in order to sell more newspapers The famous saying Blame the Maine on Spain came out of this You guys didnt even mention the Maine at all but it was the catalyst Not doubting that there was domestic opposition to this its just that every video Ive seen on the subject and whatever I have read has always painted Mckinley as begrudgingly bowing to the public pressure brought on by the incident thus starting the war Asserting that McKinley started the war based on his own personal imperialist leanings against the better judgement of the American people just doesnt corroborate with the absurd amount of flame fanning that Hearst and Pulitzer had done with the Maine I know that once the war was won and the USA had gained Guam Puerto Rico and the Philippines the America public was up in arms about the fact that their army was dealing with the subsequent uprising in the Philippinesbut that intense domestic pressure line was used to describe the buildup to the war in a way that makes it seem like the public didnt want to fight Spain They very much did Not trying to argue here just want to know if literally every single thing Ive read or seen on the subject is incorrect,
Yes super power of Shef boy rd,
This will be history after Trump turning it upside down,
You mentioned nothing about America Profiting from both world wars America benefited economically throughout both wars and thus when others were poor due to fighting America became a superpower,
Now America has turned into a big bully bullying the weaker nations and imposing tariffs on developing countries,
our world was always a idiot place and will be in future so we need just one more world war 3 and everything will be finished,
Hope you are neutral in politics,
Correction  How america became the biggest and most successful colony of israhell,
The United States is a newer modern trendier Industrialized version of the Roman Empire,
As long as we still have a military and people to fight in it our empire will stay rich and vast in territory,

Russia lets spread communism USA Knock knock its the US,
How America became a superpower WWI How America became the worlds leading superpower WWII,
Because it sat back for most of ww2 an would cripple countries with loans lasting half a century Including their parent the UK to which they swallowed their assets and empire Basically de facto becoming the superpower Also its capitalist structure would expand wealth inequality an solidify its strength,

*IM HERE FOR SPICY COMMENTS*,
Covfefe,
Cherry meet picking Way to warp the truth Vox Another swing and a miss,
America had the advantage of having vast as yet untapped resources that were exploited right at the same time that the Industrial Revolution moved in to high gear It never had to devote vast resources to protecting the homeland its efforts could be concentrated on expansion The SpanishAmerican war was probably the last time that the Victors benefited by winning Wars fought after that unless you jumped in late became so destructive Victory  Defeat were no longer so different In WW1  WW2 Americas industry supplied the Allies with food weapons  ammunition in staggering amounts All of this was paid for in hard currency including a staggeringly large amount of gold  America got rich as a result By the time that war became inevitable American war industry had become robust  efficient an expensive learning curve that was funded by the Allies  mainly Britain Other countries in WW1  WW2 had to face the strain of war with unprepared economies  industrial base America is now facing the same fate Instead of tanks  aircraft they buy Chinese goods sending billion to China  then blaming others when China gets rich enough to build an aircraft carrier America got richbut not smart,
Nato was created for more than anticommie purpose It is the best thing that happened to us alongside joining EU If the nato and un existed before WW1 or WW2 it would have probably avoided them It was created as a lesson and as a necessity so it transcends the purpose of just fighting commies,
Can you do a video how South Korea became so prosperous in such a quick amount of time,

Government creates its illusion of legitimacy by solving problems that it creates We wouldnt need a centralized government to usher in peace if centralized governments werent engaging in war in the first place at the behest of central banks The real problem is this game that psychopaths play to enslave the rest of us using state power Conquest now continues through the use of deception and psychological warfare against the general populace as well as through the fiat ponzi scheme of debt based currencies The military industrial complex and the central banks are plundering and enslaving the entire globe,
the Warriors blew a 31 lead,
Fortunately for the world Trump can be president for only max 8yrs Anything he does would be definitely reversed by his successor,
they stole stuffs from other countries and then became the super power country _,
Okay but the Soviet map is not accurate Yugoslavia had a falling out with the USSR and was not under their influence despite the fact Yogoslavia was socialist,
241 It was not a decisive factor at all,
Yeah they came to the Dominican Republic but we kicked them out,
the us was not a decisive factor in ww1,
I need a cool hat like the one in the thumbnail,
513 why is yugoslavia soviet,
Thanks to Jerusalem,
i always wondered as a brit how America became THE country yknow this answered it thanks ps keep up the political videos the best people are the informed ones,
Of course they have to talk about Trump at the end,
Stealing the secret to be a superpower,
I AM GOD,
600 billion a year ready to throw a war at anyone  800 military bases  joined WW2 almost in the end and took the whole credits MFS America  main terrorists  propagandists  all in the name of democracy ,
Yugoslavia wasnt part of the Soviet Union,
Whats the track at the end over the credits called I cant seem to find it in your music credits and I love it,
I hope so It all feel apart with world war one I am truly blessed to be born in the USA People need to under stand time periods and how life is without electricity Most Americans have zero clue what life was truly like years ago 1900 1800 1700 DAM AMAZING WE ARE HERE   Good video,
This video lowkey summed up my us history class but we went much more in depth,
America really just outplayed everyone else LMAO,
WellWhen every major war is not fought in your own land and you act as a Bank to rebuild the countries that you destroyed it seems pretty obvious why they became a superpowernot hating on US thoughjust citing the facts,
Wholesale,
So 911 didnt have anything to do with the US engaging in a economically destabilizing war for 14 years,
Exploring other countries Next,
So nice to know that Sicily and Sardinia are out of NATO ,
Unfortunately the US has grown into one of the biggest arms dealers on the planet and their economy is interlinked with and dependent on a military industrial complex It could have been predicted that their arms technology could later be used against them Feudal cultures that were based on hand combat using swords suddenly found themselves being trained by the CIA to use weapons with much more power Couple that with a society that worships the martyr living in a comparatively hopeless situation and you have a recipe for escalating violence that is very hard to contain It is not easy to stop that kind of cycle but an ethical way to start would be to reduce the US dependency on the sale of weapons to other countries,
Too bad the USA has lost any sense of justice and respect for individual and N azad rational sovereign rights,
Lol I know 1 word deception,
In other words we took over moderating the world when Britain got tired of it,
Prosperity to who,
US avoided economic disaster after WWII because it was the only country that didnt have the war right in its backyard So dont claim it as smth that US managed themselves,
God bless America Greatest country on earth,
hmmm maybe it was the 500 billion in free labor that helped the country to become a world power glad you talked about this oh wait of course you forgot that point,
Absolutely horrible Does not mention how Europeans could no longer be imperialist powers after WWII because they Bolger could afford or maintain control over the countries they dominated,
slavery  save yourself time,
japan is not the same country it was on December 7th 1941 if anything they are a symbol of american capitalism and industry america literally is so wealthy that we broke down a govt in to nothing literally burning the capital to the ground and turning two of its largest cities into glass and then in 70 years built it into the third largest economy in the world let them defend themselves they dont have an emperor anymore if anything we need to convince the neighboring countries to japan that it is okay to let them have a military again and that will be hard almost has hard as going to the moon but if we have learned anything from american history its that we can do anything,
AMERICA HAD WORLD STANDARDS IN THE 20S 30S 40 50 AND 60S IT HAS BEEN IN RAPID DECLINE SINCE THE LATE 70S,
How it became a superpower One word SLAVERY,
506 Yugoslavia was never apart of the soviet union,
America salaam Taiping people paix paz,
next time 1min long tell me it feels good,
True superpower  Them,
One of the least biased videos on this channel,
**accidentally throws ball behind** _Mii Characters_  *AH*,
**Attemps to curve ball** **throws wii remote at TV**,
Wait till the US Govt finds out that theres oil in bowling alleys,
one time I accidentally threw the ball into the other lane,
*When you dont even bowl but you carefully study a bowling video*,
Those lanes have so much oil Im surprised the US hasnt staged a military coup to profit off of it Oh wait,
Oil pattern Us army *HOL UP*,
251 My teacher told me hooking wasnt a career choice This video proves him wrong,
Can I implement these tactics in Wii sports,
but will it work on Wii sports,
US ARMY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION,
America oil BREAKING NEWS America claims all bowling alleys,
Guess who got banned from his local bowling alley by throwing the ball at the ceiling Ps I due to getting a really small bowling ball that my finger got stuck in,
Starting to see a lot of local bowling alleys shut down We need to make bowling great again,
i cannot express how much i didnt need to watch this,
I always knew oil had a huge effect on the ball but not being able to see the patterns and such I never did get it Now if only there were special glasses and such that can show the oil patterns that would be a great help,
America did you say oil **invaded bowling lanes**,
Bowler ahggg I got the oil pattern wrong USA didid u just say *oil*,
This is Litterly only for the people who can curve the ball idk how tf to do that,
Oil Ohill OhYell Koolaid man* OhYeah,
Omg This video is so helpful when I cant explain bowling simply The surface level stuff that people need to know are all in this video The more indepth stuff is like the anatomy of a bowling ball ball reaction how to change the reaction of your ball with different releases ahhh bowling is such a complex game ,
I really hope somebody caught that ball and there isnt a huge divot in that lane,
Before you think this is a way of rigging the game its not for the average Saturday afternoon bowler The oil patter then typically use for open bowling is such that it will guide the ball toward the center or the strike zone so bowlers dont get frustrated and get better scores For semiserious bowlers like league bowlers they are well aware of the patterns and can either adjust to the conditions or change to a hardersofter ball Its part of the game There are also many different patterns that give different results Something else to consider a freshly conditioned lane is ideal for a serious bowler Its predictable Since the oil only goes down about 3545 feet you get that distinct hook at the last moment the latter part of the lane is dry the ball spin grabs and the ball hooks Now after several games on a lane the oil gets carried all the way down to the pins so you have to either move a board or two over or switch balls Anyway without oil bowling would be boring and predictable,
when pros include math and physics while you are just rolling balls,
i was taught by this man in person how to read lanes hes an amazing dude his family is just as awsome,
You just made me never want to try bowling ever again,
Hey Niko Its Roman lets go bowling,
Thanks for the advice i can finally beat my cousin roman at bowling,
The US bowling cup is called the US Open They missed out a grand opportunity to call it the Super Bowl,
So My life is a lie,
This isnt necessarily something just a pro would know With the push of college and youth bowling competing on more of these sport shots There is the junior gold championships which is nationals for youth bowlers that bowl on 4 different patterns over 4 days I do love that you are going more into the mechanics and the actual reality of how much more there is to bowling than just throwing a ball down the lane I also do have to say I have met Parker Bohn several times and he is one of the nicest pros I have ever met,
They are not hidden you can look them up,
Did you just say *oil* *US has entered the chat*,
ive been using left handness as an excuse to suck at bowling for years when i really had the advantage the whole time guess i just suck lmao,
*The USA wants to know tour location*,
You Why did I watch this Me WhAtS bOwLiNg,
US Army Did Someone Say Oil,
Thats so odd that the balls never come back all oily,
imma be using this on wii sports,
Things I wish I knew while playing wii sports,
Who else is a bowler,
What the name of music at very beginning,
Great video Love that you used such an experienced bowler to explain this Much respect for PB3 and I think the rest of the competitive bowling community can agree with me,
the guy who throws it up in air is my sister LOL,
how do icurve my ball when i throw ima break my wrist,
I feel bad for being closer to the professional bowler then you,
I dont even bowl but watched this 20 times,
better make sure yall dont put too much oil on your bowling lanes or the US will invade your local bowling centre,
155 Weird flex but ok,
Tldw lefties have an advantage in yet more sports,
I have no idea about it but its interesting,
I thought you just throw the ball and just knock down the pins theres more to it,
Me after watching this video yall better watch out ima pro bowler now,
nah i dont throw the ball,
i dont even bowl YouTube here now do it,
So oil in Bowling is the broomstick in Curling,
Please make a video about chess,
Leave it to Vox to genuinely intrigue me for 8 minutes with a video about bowling oil,
Yup I have first hand experience with these Not very pretty what happened to me,
DAMMIT I DID IT WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM,
The first day and I think one of the only days Ill ever bowl was back when I was 11 Majority of my tries were strikes knocking down all the pins in one go,
Who needs real bowling when you can get a perfect 300 in Wii Sports,
*You see the Oil there* FBI OPEN THE DOOR,
I just went bowling today,
I been bowing for a long time since I was in high school bowling league and I always do the same things as you are talking about and I always in the 100s for my bowling score,
All I could think of was Scott the Engineer lol,
004 You 007 The guy she told you not to worry about,
*throws ball behind me* Other soldiers *insert jerry face here*,
i remember getting strikes on wii sports by aiming at that arrow on the right so does wii sports also do the oil thing,
When the goverment finds out the bowling lanes has oil *FBI BOWL IT UP*,
059 Hes been turned into an arcade game Well I guess Parker Bohn III got turned back into a human some time before this video was made,
Ah bowling the only professional sport where eating is allowed on the field of play,
US are gonna bring democracy and freedom to the bowling alley,
Hi does anyone know the name of this song on the start of video,
I feel like this is like sweeping in curling Yes it factors in but I really cant wrap my head around it making or breaking the skill of the bowler A Pro bowler has aim accuracy and muscle memory down to the instinct,
DID SOMEONE SAY OIL 3 OCLOCK MOVE MOVE MOVE SECURE THE AREA,
Hey vox just hit 12 subs wanna collab,
I just bowl straight and hard coming in from the right into the pocket I do this about once every 10 years now Every time we go the lanes are full of league bowlers and there are no lanes open for others  I usually bowl 130s 2nd of 3 games is my high one to warm up one good one last one Im wearing down,
Is That Roman Bellic,
*owling* 110,
Anyone who bowls regularly knows about the different oil patterns and the uses of each Theyre not hidden at all,
This is vox This is a professional PC builder Ok,
Anybody else cringe super hard seeing that ball get lofted so high,
At the beginning where the house ball goes flying,
It depends on what kind of ball you have also Im a lefty so yeah,
When Vox starts the video by roasting you and your bowling skills ,
Now I can be good at wii bowling,
I just found meaning to my miserable life thanks Vox,
Vox could be doing a video on why its important to bite toe nails and sound it like the best thing youve heard all day,
004 well thats just like ehmm your opinion man,
Which means i can use the bowling lane as a slip n slide,
Video starts off comparing me to a failure of a bowler Dont you ever start off comparing me to trash like that,
America Lets give bowling lanes Some freedom and democracy,
210  Curling fans understand this Different types of ice temperature and pebbling height change how much a rock curls 415  Auto racing fans understand this Cars get lighter and tires degrade as laps pass which changes handling braking and top speed,
Im just gonna do how Tom Harverford does,
Did that dude just seriously throw the bowling ball 2 feet in the air at the beginning,
Video Oil US Army Raids every single bowling alley,
I love this stuff Straight outta Wisconsin baby,
*throws ball behind to the seats* People sitting jump and twirl when the ball comes back yelling AAH This is 95 of Wii Sports bowling,
wait Theres oil on the alley  Seems like it needs democracy,
does this apply to wii bowling,
America wants to get that oil,
For some reason I always get it right and get them all or all except one I didnt know this hmm,
studying bowling lanes instead of calculus,
This is you Me THIS ISNT ALL OF US HUN i am a bowler,
After watching this I feel like I can win at bowling from my friends,
Am I the only drunken college student that DID take a class on bowling form All of this was repeats for me but a good refresher Novice stuff for a learned individual but definitely this is a great video for anyone who wants to get into bowling,
Thanks I cracked a hundo cuz of this,
Bowler Oil *AMERICA WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*,
I guess you could say we got some LuBeD LaNes,
528 I feel you bro Lets be friends,
Every hole is different  Tiger Woods,
I sold Parker Bohn 3 pairs of pants years ago when I worked for Mens Warehouse Super nice guy,
Last clip lowkey boast on his bowling toy haha,
U do a video and your example bowling shots show only the bowlers back each time You are not smart,
Vox making everyone interested and care about an issue we otherwise wouldnt have noticed,
was eating bagel with creme cheese *end of video* laughspat creme cheese onto the computer monitor   theres sticky white stuff on my computer monitor,
The only thing I know is that the more beer I drink the better I bowel,
Then tell me why I slipped the second I entered the bowling alley,
or a friendless video producer whos greatest thrill in life was standing on a bowling lane *rubs lane in sorrow*,
I didnt plan to watch the whole thing but here I am,
 oh no no stop watch this video at 058 dont need to put currency number in here video at 055 to 058 NOT important,
*grabs wii remote* *throws remote at self* *dies*,
This makes bowling so much more exciting,
No wonder why i slipped and fell on my head,
USA  This Video has OIL,
*video keeps saying OIL* USA  Did you say OIL,
I wanna build a PC Yall got any pro tips Kappa,
Bowling*has oil* USAHippity Hoppity youre now my property,
Ah its oiled so thats why cartoons portrayed it as a slippery floor,
Oh man I wonder how the blind guy that bowled a perfect game did it,
What do you mean by Hidden everyone knows this but I bowl so maybe everyone dosent know this,
Hey Cousin Lets go bowling,
Hey Niko Lets go bowling,
I tried to google more videos on hooking and balls but was swiftly reminded of what those search terms merit,
Does Jaehyun know about this,
Are there policies regarding refinishing the lanes I can picture a pro insisting on the lanes being refinished during a tournament ,
Now i can win in Wii sports,
Now i can win in Wii sports,
Roman Hey Niko do you want to go bowling,
Didnt work Wtf Should I try extra virgin oil next time,
This is an awesome breakdown and I love the comparison to golf,
Extra bumper and I still get the gutter,
okay I watched it YouTube chill,
That guy just threw the bowling ball nobody does that unless they want to damage something,
I dont have to worry about oil on lanesi play super fast and straight lolzz,
why am i watching this I NEVER BOWL,
USA gonna raid all bowling alley and get those oil,
Hey cousin lets go bowling,
Woahcould it be A sport where lefties have sorta an advantage *My time is now*,
British Airways Boarding Music towards the end Brought back some memories,
Now I can say to all of my friends that Its the oil patterns The workers mess them up before I come before I go bowling Thanks Vox,
I throw two handed personally gives ya more leeway on your approach and form so as long as you have a good release you can find alot faster improvementsalso a lefty tho so I get a bit of an advantage,
the hidden oil pattern on your face,
And then there is me whos happy if the ball stays in the lane xD,
When the worlds oil wells run dry we can start sinking wells at bowling alleys,
I was hesitant at first on watching this video but Im glad I eventually did ,
HEY BUDDY YOUR ADDICTION  IS GETTING THE WORST OF YOU ,
Youll likely never experience the ideal condition of these oil patterns if you dont bowl in a league or tournament If you bowl in a league youll likely experience it on the 2nd to last night of the season when the league teams are bowling for final placement in the standings The last night of the season is sweeps and award ceremony based on the league ending stats from the week before And youll experience it bowling in a tournament So how do you use this knowledge In a league or tournament use the practice period to see how your ball is responding to the oil condition of the lane If you need to adjust you can move so youre putting your ball down on a different board and you can aim at a different arrow or board I suppose you can also adjust the amount of spin you add to the ball I threw a straight ball and never purposely tried to adjust the spin on my ball,
I have always done this making my ball go on the side of the middle of the lane and I would always get a strike I never knew this was the reason why I just did it because I saw it worked in Wii Sports,
Lol Im still gonna play with the bumpers I suck at bowling forever,
I tried this and ended upside down with my dingaling stuck in someones trunk lock,
Funny thing is most people whore studying this video arent good enough to where knowing oil patterns is enough to make a difference to their game,
So bowling on a basketball court for gym is a disadvantage,
As a competitive bowler I can say this is 100 accurate and very informative Thanks for acknowledging this underrepresented sport,
Great explanation and graphics,
when i think professional bowling i just think WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM DAMN IT RIGHT uh but memes aside very interesting video,
how am I just seeing this when I bowl here weekly and personally know this man,
USA Did someone say OIL,
a friendless video producer whos greatest thrill in life was standing on a bowling line  dude love yourself a little lol,
Does this work in FIFA 2K17,
Good video Bad music choice,
No wonder why I suck at bowling,
hey I granny role while bowling and always win,
This is you No this is Patrick,
Niko cousin it is your cousin want to go bowling,
What Theyve been using invisible guides this whole time,
Thats why no one has gotten a 300 in duckpin bowling,
people the bowling rink is covered in oil *US army wants to know your location*,
 a friendless video producer thats rough,
Finally A story about an issue that the Vox staff can handle without looking loke complete buffoons,
That dude in the sneakers is better than me I bowl like Im Steph Curry,
Vox Ruins Everything,
How are you able to make me watch a video about something I really am not interested in but then I really like it,
Chess advise can be easy if your white always move king prawn first to quickly go for center controll,
Oh So once you get a good enough form its a game entirely dependent on chance,
I didnt recognize Parker Bohn without his moustache from the 80s,
Vox makes both fun pop culture pieces and terrifying news analyse Its pretty good,
Nice video on bowling lanes hidden oil patterns Remember Blue Chip Bowling,
Professional bowler thats sad Ill just keep throwing the ball,
Also this is a professional bowler NOOOOOOOO ITS A PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYER,
OMG HOWELL LANES NJ WHAT I WAS JUST THERE LMAOOOOO,
in just 7 minutes Ive become a pro bowler,
There trace huge fix separate project coalition daughter pure production progress,
I did this with a basketball and it bounced and smashed my neighbors window,
There was a question exactly about this theme in a German TV Show today The Show is called Wer wei denn sowas ,
Next on Vox Hidden air patterns on Badminton courts,
506 this dudes lowkey flexing jordan 12 cherry nice,
Lefty  s bowl better because we can naturally hook the ball,
this is you haha killed me,
003 But pretend that Im a professional player too,
No one thinks bowling is like a basketball court,
every time Ive ever been bowling it was fun but not that fun,
i only able to make the ball go straightthats why it easy for me to get spare When I try to make it spin curve the ball always fall to the gutter,
Devanshi,
i always throw out my elbow i throw it carefully and have a clean release carefully,
I need to understand how to not get my bowling ball in the gutter first,
I LOVE PARKER BOHN THE3RD TOODID YOU DO THIS FOR PARKER OR US AMATEURS,
This is you Did you just assume my gender REEEEE,
 Im not a pro bowling and I bowl the same way he does,
I am on my high schools bowling team and we bowl mostly on an arc oil pattern,
man I should get back into bowling,
This is fckin amazing I dont ball but find this fascinating Thumbs up,
Wow I had no idea I thought I was just throwing down the lane,
I was once bowling and kept throwing the ball at the centre but towards the end it just changed directions and went to the gutter while my sisters almost gutter ball suddenly spinned around went for strikes I couldnt believe what was happening Cause I always thought you always have to aim at the centerthrow straight So it was all about the oil The time before that in the same bowling alley I kept aiming the centre and got good results so I was so confused how my skill suddenly changed,
I just watches 740 mins of something i dont even do,
That explains why the lanes are so shiny,
The only time my balls go 100 miles an hour,
I always avoided spinning the ball because I thought it would make it nearly impossible for a righty to hit the dreaded ten pin Guess Ill have to try,
Dad Why is the military here,
Watch out the US military might invade the bowling lanes,
so vox is basically saying that everything in the world is rigged,
u just compared basketball with golf and bowling lol,
No wonder I couldnt get a strike in Wii Sports,
Earlier I was a noob at bowling without any knowledge after this video I am still a noob but with knowledge ,
Nice next time i surely will win against my parents,
Now know how I keep on getting splits and open frames a lot I never strategize I never even focus on how big the curve is,
Haha the guy in red was hired by Vox,
These bowling alleys are going to get a visit from the marines soon,
The beginning was epic,
Im the guy who oils these lanes and fixes these machines xD You may not know it but when you bowl I could be standing right above the pins watching the result of your throw and judging you for it I could also be grabbing the pins off a distributor thats faulty and placing them in the correct cups so it sets down the full set of 10 pins You dont know it but im working like a monkey on cocaine out the back to ensure your game goes smoothly,
Whats intro song ,
Howell lanes has some great fries,
O I L  The us army would like to KNOW YOUR LOCATION,
wow every time I looked at Lanes I saw wood  just thought they polished it to look Nice,
Eyy cousin wanna do some bowling,
You have to knock the pins down Ive been playing it all Wrong,
Doesnt work on wii,
i dont need to watch this im a junior professional,
The most complex oil interaction is the pizza grease from the basement bowling alleys food stand that coats every single ball,
Hey Cousin Its me Roman we should go bowling sometime *Im a master bowler Niko*,
When youre a Professional bowler,
The Its Always Sunny background music saves the video,
151 FLEX tape,
I wondered why I clicked on this but now Im left wondering why I watched it,
I only pulled the turkey once in my life,
I tried it once along time ago The local Alley has at last given up and closed,
Used to play in a Sunday night team league My highest score was 243 but generally averaged 175  180 Almost saw someone bowl the perfect game but had a split on the 9th frame,
Im about to smash all my friends at bowling,
My recor is 193 and im 12 BUT IT IS MY SPORT SO HIHIHIHIHI,
**attempts to curve the ball** **lands the ball two lanes to the left**,
Imagine being the child of a professional bowler Literally the dad to end all dads,
Btw its not pronounced bone its pronounced bohn like cinnabon,
Man I was just grandma rolling,
Im so triggered by that amateur THROWING THE BALL like JUST DESTROY THE LANE WHY DONT YOU,
Used to work a bowling alley Have ran the lane machine many times Oil pattern can have a major affect on ball movement,
i dont do bowling,
Im pretty happy if my bowling ball doesnt hit the gutter,
This is why were running out of oil,
I havent been boweling in years but this video made me want to go,
The Dude abides,
Why am I watching this I dont even like bowling But he managed to make this interesting,
Thanks cause every Wednesday in pe class at my school we will go bowling,
5 minutes in and I realised Im to poor to afford bowling moving on,
Im a professional at bowling On the wii,
Maybe they lay oil just to make the game harder Its a game that theoretically could be played by a simple robot,
Wow I just learned something new,
Id always wondered why my bowling balls took so long to start spinning I always thought the polish they used was unique or something,
OVER THE LINE,
Oil *US Army Theme Song*,
003 EXUSE ME I CAN PLAY BOWLING BETTER THAN HIM *who else is triggered*,
Cant wait for the USA to invade them,
Bowling the only sport you can eat while you play And that hand dryer thing if youre sweating while your bowling youre out of shape If youre out of shapeYoure probably a professional bowler,
why am i watching this at 2 am ive never even bowled,
The music keeps the video interesting,
USA OIL OPEN UP ITS THE FBI,
Did anyone else notice the fact that the professional bowler is throwing it with his left hand Im LEFT handed This surprises me and gives me a potential that I dont suck at bowling cause I am left handed its because I suck at everything it general Now I understand,
Chill out with the oil stuff the US army will show up if youre not careful,
O I L Sudden US military presence in all bowling allies,
I did league once I got to the stage where I could bowl the ball straight and it would keep going straight until hitting the desired target One would need to watch this video a few time to understand it,
Fun drinking game Take a sip everytime the word oil is used drunkinseconds,
I cant be the only one who still throws it higher than it actually rolls,
I need to get a girlfriend,
Its 2 in the morning and I really need to work on college essays but im watching this video instead,
You *sucks at bowling* Me enlightened shooting 200 *unlocks perk that lets me see oil on the lanes side effect is i can see oil on your face too*,
Ahh Howell I was blown away when seeing this Grew up and graduated from Howell hs,
Hidden oil patterns are fake news Its a conspiracy created by the Chinese in order to make American bowlers less competitive WAKE UP PEOPLE,
DiD yOu JuSt SaId OiL *American soldiers raid bowling alleys*,
Hidden Oil Careful now the US army will seize your bowling lanes,
every hole is different  thas only suggestion I would agree with,
Back in the 70s we just used split,
When I was younger I used to be in a league never did tournaments only practices One of my balls was hugging the gutter down to the edge and my coach and I thought it would just either fall into the gutter or merely touch that corner pin Instead it swung far right and managed to hit a good chunk out of the middle I would like to say it was a strike but I honestly cant remember and why embellish where theres no proof,
Could you do one on Darts as well,
Why am I watching this at 2 am Im not even bowling that often,
that creep can roll man,
Obviously not a golfer,
This video was about oil but one important piece not mentioned is the actual ball itself There is a weight inside the ball A house ball will have the weight in the very center This is to help amateurs keep it straight in the middle of the lane Bowlers who use their own ball have the finger holes drilled in a certain spot so that the weight is off center In the video he talks about the ball hooking back to the pocket once it passes the oil This is helped by that off center weight inside the ball There is definitely a certain wrist action in throwing a curve ball but the majority of the movement to that sweet spot in the pocket is done by the offset weight bringing it there You just have to make sure you have thrown the ball so that weight reacts at the right time,
I just go for the center and dont think too much about bowling basics,
Did you say oil *USA invades*,
I never do bowling in my life yet i watched a video carefully explains how to win at bowling,
I would watch a full 3 hour long documentary on this if it was made with the same production quality of this video,
Water water water water water water water water water Ugly God,
Its amazing how Lil Pump manages to rhyme Gucci Gang with itself 7 times in the same sentence This is why he is widely considered to be one of the greatest lyricists of all time His complex rhyme structure will never be duplicated Real talent,
I hate when people say that hiphop is a talentless genre,
This is still the best edited video Ive ever seen on the internet I come back to it time and time again just to appreciate those smooth transitions and animations one more time,
Next time someone says hiphop is easy or a talentless genre pass them the link to this video Man great stuff,
In Conclusion Rappers are Smart,
WUTANG CLAN,
33K dislikes probably SoundCloud rappers mad of the bitter truth,
Rap is poetry in its best form Saying rap takes no effort is like saying poetry takes no effort Try writing an actually good poem or rap song show me whats up,
Mf Doom is one of the most underrated rappers of all time,
Now Please break down Gucci Gang,
Earl Sweatshirts Oldie verse shouldve been here,
I will always wonder why rappers like ILL Bill or Pharoahe Monch are rarely mentioned when it comes to lyricism,
I honestly have been neglecting clicking on this video for 6 months now It always appears as recommended I now understand why So glad I finally clicked,
She about to make hip hop a major,
Im glad there are people out there that nerd out about hip hop Ive never had more than 12 friends I could share my love of hip hop with So I have this whole other huge part of my life that nobody around me cares about So thanks for this series,
A bar actually doesnt have to be 4 beats It can also be 3 or 6 or 8 or any number depending on the meter A 1516 meter is not gonna have 4 beats,
Not gonna lie I found the pulsing circle beat really annoying Apart from that 1010,
I expected nas to be here,
and then theres drake Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum ,
I would watch a full 3 hour long documentary on this if it was only made with MF Doom lyrics,
Inspectah decks verse in triumph is the best example for this,
And on top of that mf doom got his style from killa priest from the WuTang family Not only that that masked styleimage was widely known by Ghost Face Killah of the Wu Tang Klan Know All of your hip Hop history before u go Giving too much credit where it doesnt necessarily need to be,
If you included Andre 3000s verse in aquemini you shouldve gone with his last verse,
MF DOOM And how about Nas  Rewind That song is genius,
Ive been ignored longer than youve been interested  Aesop,
What no love for Kool Keith Dr Octagon,
Motif not motive but good video though really explained things in a super concise and simple way,
Mf doom inspires almost everyone to become a rapper lol even people who arent into hiphop,
Please Vox expand on this and not politics,
Now we have mumble rappers which sound like they cut up words into 23 or 13 and somehow made that rhyme,
It wasnt done just for the sake of being different it just was the best way to tell a story look into uk rap,
Dont get me wrong g I understand fhis requires alot of skill and I certainly cant do it but its just not my cup of tea I dont find it pleasing to listen to,
Majority of new rappers need to see this video Might learn something Lol On another note this should be a full documentary Can we start a petition to get that started,
Where is Bustas Put Your Hands The whole song was on one syllable,
Immortal Technique took after MF or something,
I seriously watch this all the time and just wish Tech N9ne wouldve been mentioned,
Thank you miss Whomever you are Loved to learn all about this,
Moms Spaghett,
can you do one about RA the Rugged Mans Definition of a rap flow that would be amazing,
Andre 3000 has done that same setup that u saying doom used w the word booze a few different times Dont u Ever in your Life compare Andre 3000 to doom or to anyone for that matter Andre had created rhyme patterns and changed the syllable sounds of words to make them interject with other lines to the point that it has been a style that he actually gave birth to and has been notably copied by anyone who claims to be someone mainstream and underground,
Every time I listen to DOOM my ears start to sizzle a little,
I think gucci gang rhymes with gucci gang,
Inspectah Deck verse on triumph,
Youre called the same as a fascist spanish politic party who wants to deport all inmigrants build a wall in morocco and make them pay for it yeah Im not kidding,
Wow Great video and theres a lot to digest You earned a sub easy Thanks for introducing me to MF Doom too Shame I didnt get to hear you talk about Notorious Thugs,
That 90s rap was the pinnacle of hip hop From death row with dre snoop etc to outkast and goodie mob makin that southern rap Cant beat it But i think dr octagon should have been mentioned Probably the most unique rapper out there,
They should turn this into a miniseries Maybe focusing on time periods or certain rappers,
The best emcee with no chain you ever heard right ,
Mf doom will for ever be the best,
she says motive i think she means motif,
This should become a bachelors masters and doctorate,
Lmao this is like rap school 88 of rappers out here at the moment need to watch this and take notes,
Take my respect for ur amazing video,
*m o m s s p a g h e t t i*,
*i Be FlOsSiN*,
Lupe and Earl shouldve been mentioned but nevertheless she covered a lot,
Damn This video is incredible,
Eminems verse looks like a painting on the wall,
Tupac  Lyric king Eazy  gangsta king Biggie  Flow king Eminem  Rhyme king DrDre  Beat king Rick Ross  Burger king Me  CopyPaste king,
Aesop rock,
Desiigner needs to watch this video,
Great video but its motif not motive lol,
Its motif not motive right,
Thank you for taking the time to create this video It really is beautiful,
Thanks Kendrick and some others for moving the legacy Also shout out creativity _,
People in the 90s  The rap genre is wack People now  Rap is about poetry,
This just became one of my favorite videos on YouTube,
Theres not a single trapper out there today i know of showing us any talent of lyricism yet they are all considered rappers RAP is talent anybody can trap yo,
No tech n9ne slug guru masta ace,
I have found myself coming back to watch this video many times Thank you for making this excellent video,
I know he may not have the most complex structures but QTip gets the award for silkiest smooth sounding flow in my books,
I cant believe they forgot Lil Pump hes like a god,
What about Blueface tho,
As an emcee and an academic I have so much respect for this analysis,
This is literally poetry This is exactly what I as a literature student analyze when studying a poem going back to ancient Greece poetic manifestations we know poems were sang Music and poetry merging together and Rap is just our modern manifestation incredible,
Speaking about Lyrics and Rhyms without mentionning Lupe Fiasco,
Thank you for this video,
Does post malone even rap,
Rakim one of the most influential Rakim is top 3 greatest rapper of all time Man was waaay ahead of his time,

Graphics on this are impecable Nice work,
Motif **,
This is why I would like to start a conversation with Artists and Performers about opening up our beautiful 100 year old church for small venue performances and or audiovideo recording With the 70000 work we have recently had done and the 80 Rank organ we have one of if not the largest in Northern Illinois played by professional organists This Church has played venue to groups from around the world I would like to see it open to a wider variety This is my message in a bottle WE ARE THE ONLY EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN DIXON IL I AM THE JUNIOR WARDEN Have a great day and I loved this video,
I wish this could be a permanent series Rap Deconstructions I really enjoyed that visual auditory storytelling and break down,
Obrigado pela legenda em portugusbr,
Can we get a video on double time triple time and choppin Like for real,
NAS,
Em never stop amazed me,
Im just a guy waiting for the year a rapper will win a Noble Prize in literature,
You sure this aint supposed to be on Prime time tv,
What a delightful informative way of spending 12 minutes of my life,
MF DOOM is the greatest lyricist and top 5 producer of all time Idc,
Phonte the dude from little brother have a rhymestyle that is fascinating I Would call it the 121 were he connects the first and fourth bar Same with the 23 bar It is really easy for the ear and smooth,
Biggie Flow has the sexiest grouping of words you will ever read or listen to Eminem has a special way of writing as well which makes me consider him one of the best ever,
This is not just wordplay this is ART,
MF DOOMs FLOW AND LYRICS AND WORDPLAY AND WORD CONSTRUCTION is INSANE  We just did an episode on the NO PROCRASTINATION PODCAST on his entire discography come check it out and show lovein the comments,
That MF Doom guy sounds just like Reason,
Vox Please do a video on The great conductor John Williams Thank you,
Moms spaghetti,
Biggie and andres versus are legendary,
Music theory applies to everything in music  and I loved this video but you forgot to mention one of the greatest rappers in the 80s90s The Last Emperor  the guy was a God,
Eventually these dissections of hiphop will stop ignoring Aesop I hope,
You could make a whole episode on Ski Mask the Slump Gods rhymescheme,
Props on giving due credit to Andre 3000,
found em drowned in cows dung crowns flung Damn Yeah that really set the benchmark How is anyone ever gonna top that,
Im the 8 millionth view 0,
Who else heard OPEN MY KEAGLE in the intro,
Did she just call a motif a motive I thought she was pronouncing it wrong but she just used a different word,
This is the best video Ive ever seen,
Fast forward to 2018 and LilPump does Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Eminem in Business  HipHop is in the state of 911,
I think Im gonna make a whole playlist with songs like these,
Rakim,
Its a shame that today every form of art seems to get rationalized You cant express the value of music numerically,
DOOM your favorite rappers favorite rapper,
Im confused  overwhelmed but also wondrously amazed Raphiphop has to be the most misunderstood genre of all time,
MF DOOM is the greatest mc but Earl Sweatshirt is lit too very good video,
yall wrong for not including Dres last verse on Aquemini on this C,
Great Estelle amazing work you did now I understand why after listening Hypnotise by Biggie I wanted to never stop listening to music,
Such an amazing executed video Loved this earned a subscriber,
hopefully ome will start getting some love outside of constant plugs by vox because his vibe and flow are sublime,
Great video Speech from Arrested Development is also one of the big ones,
550beanz live freestyle featuring swagger jack my bars off the top,
What made Vox a hiphop pro,
Why did you not discuss Nas Probably the greatest rhymer and lyricist,
When it comes to double entendres this video doesnt give Eminem enough credit music king of double entendres IMO,
no spotify in my country to watch the playlist ,
Masta Aces on beat off beat on style Saturday night live Original and perfectly fits track,
I wouldnt call it clever,
This is absolutely amazing great work,
LMFAO 441 dont talk about lyrics and misspell RHYME gtofh,
andre 3000 and mos def are legends,
this is HIPHOP the originators cant be taught no matter how many times you watch IT IS A FELLING,
*Mumble rap has left the chat*,
WHERE IS BIG L Great video but dang how is Corleone always overlooked,
Correct me if Im wrong but Rakims 16 dots more commonly known as 16 bars are a dot on each line or bar Its not 2 dots on each bar or line its 1 dot per linebar Edit Also Rakim is reffering to lyrical bars and I was reffering to them to but in the video you only explain instrumental bars,
We go from this to Lil Yachty  Young Thug,
already knew this but good job vox 100,
3 thousand dislikes are from mumble rappers lol Aye jk calm down,
Enjoyed watching this Teach this as a course at a university or something Cuz this was solid and your explanations are simple clear and intellectual,
This is one of the most informative reviews of hiphop Ive ever seen plz continue the good work,
MF Doom is sick but wheres Nas Talk about unpredictable and unorthodox without kool keith,
Frank Zappas 1973 I am the slime,
This is beautiful Thank you for the hardwork,
One of my favorites is Sticky Fingaz on Remember Me,
Ok what I took away is moms spaghetti,
90 of rappers today need to take note,
This is great Great rap knowledge and great intro to some basic terminology Awesome production quality Thank you,
Analyse wretch 32 The man is a genius,
Rakim and Guru best mcsvideo over Especially Rakim invented the hesitation on Follow the Leader,
Great construct to the vid dropped a follow just coz of the content awesome stuff,
If you mumble you can rhyme virtually every word,
brilliant video  amazingly constructed do a full length   and thank you for your wisdom,
The technical information is on point but the bottom line is if you dont have soulrhythm and an imagination you can never be great EmceeRhyme Sayer,
*BLUEFACE BABY*,
Motif Pronounced Motief or mtf,
You guys are absolutely killing it,
Despite my best efforts I actually learned something Well done,
hey pls do a video about Big Ls rhyme sheme would be awesome,
Az tragedy kadafi killa sin raekwon,
MF Doom sounds like Immortal Technique,
i really appreciate this persons love for rap and how much effort this took,
1040 underrated Stevie sample How can you Believe go DOOM,
My mind just blew up I really dont understand how someone can create such a complex thing both in words beat just everything and its incredible,
DOOM is easily the greatest and most indepth lyricist in the history of Hip Hop You could write an entire book breaking down the references and meanings behind the rhymes of just one of his songs He tells a story while including obscure references to a vast variety of topics with outrageously creative and mindblowing rhyme schemes and deadpan humor all delivered with an unmistakable unique flow that is all his own,
Man im so happy you started with doom You didnt even use his craziest lyric song rhinestone cowboy,
okay but have you heard gucci gang by lil pump,
You can literally read EMs highlighted bars and it could still be a full song,
Abalaleiura adhue bneur slaksjhdgwepiu Migos,
big puns flow on deep cover,
The rest is emp ty with no brain but the cle ver nerd The best M C with no chain you e ver heard I immediately reminded this Doom rhyme when he said Doom had rhymes where all the setup bar rhyming with the punchline,
I came here because I guessed MF DOOM wouldnt be in this video and was going to complain I stand corrected,
Andre 3 Stacks 2nd Verse on Aquemini is one of the most phenomenal rap verses ever created,
Motif not motive but otherwise a great video,
Two words Aesop Rock,
Em can do something like that,
Wheres Nas,
You should do a similar break down on Bone Thugs N Harmony,
Can you do a video on techno and especially the Detroit legends including Drexciya,
The animation is so smooth Yall can edit,
3 Stacks no need 2 say more,
should be teaching this in English lit class and poetry in colleges,
BIG PUN also is very complex and has a great flow,
Born sinner the opposit of a winner  remember to eat sardines for dinner Also sound like when i remember,
Outsider  Loner  Korean rapper analyze that,
Doom is like the Vasyl Lomachenko of rap,
Great vid but there are so many rhymes in Kurtis bar that they dont give credit for kinda tight tbh Repetition alliteration and multisyllables if you look for them,
I recommend checking out samsas work,
When you described a M O T I F you said motive and it is bothering me physically,
I love this music its so artistic I miss Tupac and Biggie,
Motive is okay I guess but in music it is referred to as Motif,
Shout out to everyone who know Rigamortis before it blew up,
Still none of these guys compare to the rhyming capacity of lord and savior of hip hop Lilliam pumpernickle,
Great video But its pronounced  mo tiff not motive,
135 in a 44 songright,
Lmao alll the mumble rappers and trap rappers must have gotten a headache after watchim this,
No mention of Big L though,
gracias al quien hizo los subtitulos 8I,
Im you mentioned MF Doom,
Lecturing birds how to fly,
Its actually motif not motive,
Can yall make this a documentary,
Now you know blueface is a rhythmic genius,
mos is arguably one of the greatest do shade on nas or big l,
did not expect to see death grips on that spotify list,
MF Doom so underrated,
This felt good to watch When i was a kid like 9 or 10 i heard Rakim and immediately thought hes the best I didnt know why but i felt it This vid just solidified and quantified my intuition Thank you,
I would love to see a video about Vinnie PazKrinoBeast1333Ra Rugged ManHopsinCanibusLocksmith,
This is a terrific video and the linked Spotify Playlist is pretty quality too,
Tech9 freeway should be mentioned,
nothing will ever top gucci gang pump rhymed every two words consistently,
this what white boys use to learn how to rap lmao jk,
This is a good video and a good take but you author needs to understand theoretic timing A measure isnt always 4 or on the 1234 as you mentioned many different time signatures apply to a lot of your songs,
Im blown by the quality of this video very educational yet entertaining Great stuff,
This explains the love for hip hop that most dont understand I can watch this over  over ,
This what pure hiphop fans hear when they listen to rap  unfortunately for the mainstream listeners  they dont get to hear this very often ,
Vox doesnt like the Nword,
Epic Rap Battles contain some of the cleverest wordplay I have ever encountered,
Where lil pump at,
Rappers are geniuses to me I can never freestyle anything,
So you Really forgot NAS Anyway still a good Video,
3 stacks is the GOAT,
This video is incredible It really inspires me to write and I love analysing rhymes Well done Vox Another fantastic video,
Why dont they ever break down Krayzie  Bizzy Bones bars,
KAAN and Token are keeping music like this going,
*Best Rhyme Ever* Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace x100,
More videos like this please This is so well done,
Open mike eagle Mad underated Check out lackadasical wax feat open mike eagle,
**MOTIF,
Bars are only in 44 time now None of these techniques are new except for the artistic use of error a real novelty and surprisingly useful here,
Personally I think it was really impressive how Eminem managed to make an entire song where he just kept rhyming moms spaghetti with moms spaghetti over and over,
this was a GREAT video i learned so much,
Hop hop loop like panelope cruize  you use hair oil  i rub moose you waer sandles made of my skin i wear shoes from your jewellery,
This is one of the best videos on YouTube Me and some of my classmates have used this video a couple of times for our college presentations about literature and poetry,
if you love this youll enjoy my youtube real ish i gots that dope hip hop day in day out i basically dont know any thing else,
They almost on lil pumps level,
Okay now lets get back to MF DOOM *hype intensifies*,
No mention of Aesop Rock or any of the Wu geniuses Ok sure,
Bust down thotiana blueface,
only they never referenced the top 2 or 3 MCs of all time,
When someone says hip hop is easy theyre not wrong hip hop can be extremely easy for example mumble rap But when hip hop is made into an artform and a way of self expression it is anything but easy artists like Rakim Ice Cube Biggie 2Pac Naughty by Nature Eminem Kendrick etc use hip hop as a storytelling divice a paintbrush a weapon and therapy A genre of music where an artist is able to tell you a story that you identify with and still make every word rhyme with every other word in the song that is skill That to me is hip hop,
Spotify playlist name,
One of the best video Ive ever watched Vox you better raise the girl behind it ,
Mention mumble rappers,
So Ab soul just gonna stay slept on Alright,
I wish that THat Part was out when this was made Kendricks verse on the remix was amazing I think Genius has a check the rhyme on it,
Dance with the devil by Immortal technique tells one of the most captivating stories ever,
You shoulda mentioned earl sweatshirt,
Best line of all time Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Gucci Gang,
I feel like this video needs a revisit or a part two I cant get enough,
Thank you for making this video,
The meter is the pattern of stressedunstressed scalable within a line Meter can make all of difference Rhyme is only half of the component,
I would never be able to thank Vox enough for this video,
How abouts LOGIC style ,
props to giving Mos Def some credit,
you shoulda put dooms verse on figaro on there do not stand still boast your skills close but no krills toast for po nils post no bills coast to coast joe schmoes flows ill go chill not supposed to overdose no doz pills,
Thank you Estelle  I never knew there was some much complexity in rap music I did hear it but no body broke it down down like that They are poets by another name yeah X 3 it called the rap game lol,
Lmao ofc UMG claimed the vid lmao,
Love to see an analysis of Joyner Lucas rhymes,
If this was a class Id show up at 5 am on Saturday its so good If you know me you know my deep deep despite of mornings especially on the weekend Thats how much I loooooove this Awesome subscribe Wish yall mentioned Nas though,
no pac hes the lyricist god,
Damn so yall gonna diss the greatest writer Jay Z like that,
You gonna make me sick Picks your know On science with flow Hell no we soildjers gijoe What do you call that lol,
Hell on earth Mobbing Deep amongst the greatest beats ever,
Makes you never wannna put a pen on the paper considering how bad it will sound compared to Eminem or Mf,
Motif Not a motive,
This was super interesting and informative I have to find that spotify playlist now,
this is really truly a great video and I appreciate videos like this so keep doing what you doing cuz youre doing it right but I really got to mention that you missed something actually two majors in my eyes but youll just have to get back to me if you really want to know not only the power of these ways and styles of rapping but how insanely intense and almost aliens rated no alienated or very different nonhuman lets put it that way theres something is that I just figured out is that only the finest of rappers are you doing  get back at me and let me know if youre on the same level or if you would like to be elevated oh an jus ah FYI im not even a wrapper  RIGNEHLS,
I present to you the best up and coming rapper of 2018 D Vinci Cherish this moment and comment D Vinci offers no qualms or hesitation with his brutal delivery President Trump quivers at his name He is the champion of the United States Constitution and he is the personification of personal liberty Do you doubt him Download his album for free  or listen to it on his YouTube now y7tc t,
kind of pissed how she skipped over 1994 where nas dropped illmatic  completely changed the game in terms of flow  rhyme scheme at the time,
Oh my god this is beautiful,
This was pretty dope,
Lose yourself still gives me the chills Thanks for this vid,
Your English teachers should be celebrating Your skills evoke my envy,
moms spaghetti,
id like to the experts deconstruct some suga free,
Wouldve been great if you guys also dissected earl sweatshirt,
Lil Waynes flows double entendres word plays are amazing Make a video about that,
this vid is so great thanks so much cant wait to see mo of your stuff i wish i could rap like they had who knows maybe someday ill have the guts,
And here we are With Lil Pump at the top of the charts and minds of todays youth,
i think shakesphere was the best rhymer of all time,
This is the only Vox related thing Ive ever enjoyed,
Shadowboxin Gza  Meth Man,
Id love more music analysis videos like this,
Theres truly a science behind hip hop,
Suprised there was no mention of big l or big pun or even k rino,
Hypnotize didnt make it to the Spotify playlist ,
Low key MF DOOM reminds me of a grandpa nas And mentor to Tyler the creator,
People who stereotype black people as unintelligent have never heard True rap music,
657 that oscar winning song became a meme lmao We are all doomed,
If you claim to have a little problemWell Scott LaRock knows just how to solve emIf youre a guy a ninell do the trickBut if youre a girl you need some flowersI admit Scott has strange powersEnticing girls in less than an hourOr should I say minutes I seen how he did it KRSOne 1987,
these people have good english skills,
Dope thank you,
I used to think all rap was was inaudible mumbling with the occasional swear word This video made me realize that rapping is an art Thank you,
Dont give Em too much credit He didnt know We did,
This is what I like about vox over genius or something they recognise real rappers the people behind it are real rap heads who respect the genre,
They should make a Documentary on Mumble Rap Lmao,
Raphip hop deserves so much more respect from the elite musically educated crowd A lot of hip hop songs are more complex layered and transcendent then even some of the best poetry through out history but musical elites still believe that is hasnt matured as a musical platform and dont consider it as an Art This really needs to change,
whoevers controlling me is doing a really bad job,
Then this game is made by EA because everywhere are microtransactions,
*Elon exposes life* _*Admin has joined the server_ _*Elon has been kicked from the server_,
200 dude on the left lagging or something,
this explains why we go to the fridge and dont get anything from it we are just saving the game,
Sodeaf people dont have their sound on,
So sleeping is basically when our controllers are afk and just play movies for us so we dont get bored,
I need the person controlling me to use a cheat code and find me a good wife deposit 100000 into my life,
911 was just a hacker adding bots to grief the server,
What was my guy thinking when he made my characters face,
this is like that one rick and morty episode,
Im gonna say the N word,
The guy controlling me is trash at gaming,
what about the mandela effect or deja vu I think those are glitches,
Graphics are good but the gameplay and community is terrible i want transferd to a different server,
The dinosaur exstintion was just a server wipe,
Everything is complex answer  God,
This comment section is a gold mine,
Why tf did I have this theory at 7 I was playing with my Barbies or something and then I was like hmm what if someone is doing the same to me It was deep for a seven year old lmao,
If we live in a simulation can someone put it on easy mode please,
200 old manEXE has stopped working,
No wonder I double jumped once but it got patched the day after,
So thats why my mom called me a glitch,
If were simulated that means we were simulated to know that we were simulated,
This game is paytowin,
My controller is watching youtube about a simulation,
Dang who created my avatar I want to meet them,
Idk why the person controlling me hasnt used motherload to give me money,
If Im a simulation then why does this guy have to even bother Like is my life even worth simulating for Most of the time it must feel like crap for him,
were not living in a simulation were living in a microverse in a car engine producing energy why do you think were so interested in oil,
Elon  we are living in a simulation Me  ALT F4,
Elon watching too much anime,
If you did something on accident the person controlling you missed clicked,
Guys I just leveled up,
I feel bad for abusing my sims now,
Sooo If we are in a simulation how do I apply for admin D,
Hate this server so toxic and overpopulated they need to make more realms already I need to start a fresh character,
Steven Hawkins was madly nerfed,
Well in patch 7636463 we will all forget about this video,
So jesus is an admin that visited us,
What if we are in a simulation where the creators of our universe gave us a story of god Which people belived but some people wanted attention so they wrote their own version of the story of god This kept happening which entually made religions This was done to see what would happen if we were given some knowledge of us being in a simulation And the creators made other simulations without religion,
Ya I have been lagging lately but I think they patched it in update 94,
Dont trust a dude who never smoked weed until 2019,
Ok but if someone is actually controlling me then whos controlling that person and so on,
this game is pay to win,
The guy whos controlling me is trash Nothing is happening to me for like 2 years cmon dude Do something,
Wait arent we basically selfreplicating robots,
I thought that when i was 10,
Me 2 I always think this when im bored,
Plot Twist  *Elon Musk is controlling us all*,
1 in billions chance this is base realitybut that doesnt necessarily mean we live in what we understand is a simulation but a form of a simulation in a spiritual sense Soul growth energy etc,
So if I watch YouTube the person controlling me is gonna get bad quality sound of the video,
I sort of agree Sometimes do you ever feel like everything dosent feel real it just dosent feel right Then you start questioning it your body starts to tingle,
So life hacks are bannable,
If we live in a simulation spawn me some money please,
Can we switch players my player sucks,
Videos like this are helping Americas youth become more ignorant and unattached Sad,
Real life  graphic awesome Gameplay borring,
Elon Elon I know where proof is and I also know of several scenarios that scream simulation difficulty patch jobsIll tell you but Im dirt poor so some money would be nice U wont be disappointed,
Whoever is simulating me should use a cheat code and make me win the lottery,
Let there be light turns up brightness on computer,
Okay so where do i type in the money cheat,
ServerAdmin please change the mode to PEACEFUL Because right now it really feelin like Hardcore,
Well simulation or not if I dont pay my bills my lights go out,
Were not living in a simulated world yetthis beast is waiting for its greatest deception yetLETS make the sheeple think that being CHIPPED is SSSOOOOOO DAMN convenientcoolthe in thingthen we will SNATCH them uponce we have a great number CHIPPED and CONNECTED TO THE WORLD WIDE WEBthen we have themCONTROL those zombieswere controlling them NOWthis wont be simulating at all thenthis will be the REAL mccallWAKE UP SHEEPLE,
Elon must have started smoking weed long ago,
1 and 2 Humans already run simulations out of curiosity andor amusement 3 All religions are manmade I think its reasonable to believe that we live in a advanced man manmade simulation 4 42,
Anyone watching when Elon hosted meme review,
Our creators are probably laughing now like oh my god theyre working it out,
He only said that because he doesnt like aihe believes its dangerous so he rise to popular an argument,
Were not in a simulation but we in a game that Made by God,
FYI according to ancient Indian texts they knew that the earth was indeed round,
Who ever is the coder of me is trash a math,
Hey Player if Im living a simulation can you assign me a gf  thanks,
Our user is God doesnt need to make a simulation the way we do it And if we could make one as realistic as ours that would be freaking awesome even to be in Dont think simulation as a bad thing if you do so is because you compare our simulated life to the games we have made in which detail is way worse than real life in every kind of way,
So does god have the cheat codes,
What was my person thinking Dear controller What the heck Love Simulation Girl,
Simulation brings the topic of a higher being aka God Which God ,
Almost certain then he says theres a 1 in billions chance ,
This is the same man who made RIP Harambe,
God please dont Ban me,
Thanks for the existential crisis,
The graphics are good but the tutorial lasted over 18 years,
Its 136am and I have no Idea whats going on,
So I can respawn Im gonna go try it out,
As long as were not an ubisoft game everything is fine,
Well we have minecraft No Okay,
*Time to find some glitches*,
I tried to pull off my VR Goggles but it turns out I dont have any,
 300 So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them Genesis 127,
so if we are in a simulation why are we still using birth control,
HEY PLAYER CAN YOU PLEASE BUY A QUEST COMPASS PLEAAASEEE IM LOST IN LIFE,
So if we do live in a simulation and I see my pregnant wife give birth to a baby is that a fake human or is it a player that connects to the server,
I thought about this when I was like four not going to lie,
The Elites are using mods and cheat codes Unfair,
I hate how elon is getting so much credit for what Dr Missler has introduced and mathematically proven 20 years ago using the Bible codes I guess no one wants to hear you if you use the Bible Sad,
_Should have used better designs on me _,
I dont mind living in a computer simulation as long as it isnt Windows 10,
_Whoever the one that is controlling me  please use some kind of money cheat Im running out or lets say I already runned out long time ago_,
Whoever controlling me was a big fan of mia khalifa,
Nah he just doped and saw The Matrix,
Hey look at this cool simulation I made Its just like a real universe Whoa cool But how did you simulate an infinite universe Its auto generating It keeps getting bigger What if the people in it reach the edge I made it impossible for physical matter to move at that speed and programmed a natural fear of the unknown to dissuade them Wont the smart ones notice those limitations and catch on Yeah thats why I programmed them not to trust smart people,
So are twins made by a duplication glitch,
whoever is playing my me is definitely not a pro _,
I wonder what is the real world,
I need to restart the game,
We didnt realized that he just hold f9 keyboard button after he quick save,
1950 well have flying cars in the future 2017 Were living in a simulation,
whens the new DLC dropping,
But What if WE are the ones who start this chain reaction Think about that elon,
The player controlling me is on ultra high difficulty and 0 tutorialskills,
What if were all in some kids game on some little kids console who just made us for fun,
The guy controling me is so bad in leveling me up like wtf,
Looks like Elon just watched the Matrix phh,
Cmon watch and understand The Matrix instead of thinking on these lines,
Rick and Morty plot,
It doesnt accomplish anything if we are rly living in a simulation The species Controlling us must live somwhere too It just creates more questions,
this video prooves eath is square shaped,
Not true since in simulations we controll the player and it doesnt do it on its own,
Rip The fly glitch got patched in the latest update,
As greek philosophers used to say I know only one thing that I dont know anything,
The atoms or what I like to call them graphics are pretty good,
just sounds like slavery with extra steps,
If its true then I will hack everything,
it seems the guy controlling me is out of tutorial,
So why does musk care so much ab climate change then,
They should fix some stuff in the next patch like the cant find a girlfriend glitch  thx Ubistof ,
Why cant we just be chillin instead of a simulation like what,
HESOYAM Why this cheat code dosent work,
whos controlling us an alien is the perfect answer,
Wow So the one who controls me must have messed up in the character creation then,
If this is a simulation Im sorry for the one who is playing with me I wish you couldve gotten a better character dude Or are most of us NPCs,
_GREAT Video to watch at 3am_,
I think the one controlling me need to apply the latest patch and stop using a 3rd party steering wheel when I run,
Then how do I leave the server,
This isnt a new thought Have a look at the concept of Maya illusion in Hindu philosophy,
Can my player upgrade my life pls,
So we dont see ghosts cuz they never switch their webcam on,
THE BIG BANG WAS THE START OF THE SIMULATION THERE WAS NOTHING BEFORE THE BIG BANG until the universe was *created*,
Super Twist Hitler was the admin,
Meme review Hes meming himself right,
Can the person controlling me give me an upgrade or something,
Money hack here I come,
Ok ok but is it made by EA,
Funny how Mr super intelligent Musk doesnt talk about  alien intervention as one possible hypothesis of the future Hmm Now I dont believe in that either but it is odd he doesnt suggest this either where many believe that His extinction possibility is quite correct IFand this is a BIG IF you do not believe in intelligent design and a master CREATOR Almighty God That is the issue in the Entire Universe That  Grand Creator will deliberately swallow up all non believers and evil doers into a great Black Hole of nothingness and divinely protect his worshippers that follow his direction into a New World of everlasting life and peace Who created the science of black holes Our grand Creator YHWH HE has a nice big black hole ready to swallow up this Satan distorted world coming soon No extinction for many No computer simulated existence Real life as YHWH intended Very simple truth is Subject yourself to the Creators sovereignty and will or become Extinct non existent Your choice,
This is how we know Elon musk is a stoner lmao,
I better not die till i hit that level 100,
In that case his enlightenment about us being simulated might also be a simulation of the simulator,
And god is the player I understand it know,
*Elon just simulated himself* *It all makes sense now*,
The person controlling me doesnt make me smart,
Does a fish know its in water,
Yep Sword art online,
I really hope that im in a simulation right now Ahhh,
someone pls explain his hot tub joke lmao,
Elon Musk is THE ONE,
Ive always had the thought that deja vu was some sort of glitch in the world,
your first words of this vid was Elon muk thinks were etc,
I always felt like my life was someone playing a prank on me and Im just a spectator of it,
This message is for my controller please type this cheat HESOYAM on your keyboard or whatever the thing you are using,
Hes been watching too much Matrix,
*Omnimax has left the group*,
What if were being simulated by a 4 dimentional world,
I cant feel my left boot,
If we are in a simulation Who is simulating our simulators simulators,
This is one of the people on the higher level of existence If you like my comment I will wake you up from the simulation,
If I choose number 3 do I get a simulator price,
When you realize the word simulation has SIMS in it mind blown l,
world population dies mom cAuSE OF tHAt pHOne,
Earth is flatters joined the chat,
this is basically me when im high,
why do i feel that rick and morty had a big influence on this,
The one who is controlling us  why would he play games by controlling us and then we controlling the game he can play any game in his world  and how would he have such ample time to waste on us  am I right If you think I am  Plz like here,
Well we all must be AI that has been going for millions of years,
Player that is controlling me is such a noob,
Does anyone know the cheatcode to spawn a helicopter then,
And here I cant even find a plumber to fix my sink ,
*How many lives do I have*,
There seems to be something *really* wrong with my coding,
oh i know something we players animals bots god moderator simulating us satan a nub hacker,
guys dont worry this will be fixed in the next patch,
My graphics are 144p,
K but when we die how come we dont respawn,
Earth is just a giant discord server Elon Musk is an innovator so probably has Discord Nitro,
Oh its like that one Rick and Morty episode When they enter worlds made by other worlds,
In a future patch they are going to Nerf Elon Musk so we dont catch on to everything,
So like the Rick and Morty episode,
So if I die I can just respawn lemme check,
This comment was written by the simulation and youre the only real person living among NPCs Prove me wrong,
The guy whos been simulating me stuck on Level 69,
Wait what if Im in a simulation on my own What if this video is a simulation *HELP*,
What if being drunk is just a glitch or paranormal activity or when you find your stuff somewhere else then where you put them Or Elon is just a lunatic,
but if we are a simulation cant we manipulate the simulation into making us stronger  pain free and better humans  *MOM GET THE CHEAT ENGINE*,
Our bodies are organic spaceships that are host to our consciousness Time is the medium in which it travels But the question that arises is who created these organic spaceship  the answer is still unknown So just to name someone we created God  And then just to remember the one who created us organic spaceship we pray to God  just for the goodwill of humanity  Think about it guys,
It kills me that everything is a mystery,
he watches toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much Rick and Morty lol,
Someone give whoever is playing me in a sim some cheat codes or a game genie or somethingIm still on level 1,
If we are a simulation then were prolly controlled by EA bc we havent unlocked the rest of the earths ocean,
Were in Ricks car battery,
so which pill did you take blue or red,
i try to altf4 now i just close the universe i thing i am shaggy,
Musk is gonna get kicked from the server,
But does anyone know any good hacks or mods we can use in this simulation,
Can the person controlling me please buy sharkcards,
Well whoever is controlling me they are a noob,
So if we can hack it we can do magic,
Huh no Rick and Morty commentswell ghee,
Was that Hot tub thing was a reference from Rick and Morty,
He also said he wanted to host meme review,
Or After you died everying you see will be red tinted and theres two option for you Respawn and Title screen,
Elon musk thinks we live in virtual reality Musk 1 Out Of A Billion Chance Are living in a simulation,
*HE KNOWS TO MUCH TAKE HIM OUT*,
159 to this day he is still waiting for the woman to grab his hand,
Elon Musk its the real life Lex Luthor Follow him and fall,
Multi world theory with quantom physics,
Can someone out there watching my user play tell him the cheat code for Money Thanks,
Why listen to Elon about a topic like this,
This vid is excellent succinct and encompassing for a person like me who is uninformedbutinterested in simtheory im going to break protocol by not making some laim joke even though all of them so far are really good Thanx Vox,
there better be a roblox deathsound when I die,
The person controlling me must like making bad decisions,
Maybe its global warming self replicating robots What about zombies How can you forget about these awesome guys,
If you cant make a Rick and Morty reference from this we cant be friends With extra steps,
We are living in a simulation but its nothing like Sims or matrix Those are WAY *WAY WAY WAY* too primitive for a complex simulation that were living in Atoms are 1s and 0s because they behave same,
Whos controlling the person controlling me,
The rich people are playing on very easy mode,
They should buff EA,
Seductively ifferiating or dull bore conversation,
gamemode 1 give ME command_block 1 I write this because this vidio look like it in minecraft XD,
So lets find some cheat codes for this simulation,
Does that mean that I can ask the thing controlling it to somehow upgrade me,
This comment section is god tier,
Alien to the admin sir We got a problem,
Someone controlling me doesnt spend too muh on microtransactions,
When we die do we respawn in a different server,
I mean whenever I mess something up irl now i can say it was a glitch,
Wee living in a simulation thats redi *sees a car clip into the ground shake violently and then blast out of the ground and out of the atmosphere* Huh,
the person controlling me gave me a stroke,
Hinduism have been saying these since last 4000 years That we are living in a simulationcreated by our thinking mind,
We better start searching for some cheat codes,
What a Pay to win,
Imagine if our souls are consciousness from the simulating world That means for example our body and our world are something akin to VRsomething like looking through a Vr while our souls are the eyes of the people simulating us ,
2016 we are a computer 2019 i will delete t series,
The wordsymbol and numbers do seem like a simulation,
but that sounds like slavery with extra steps,
Nothis was *patched* in last update,
Once Elon got high with Joe Rogan he was never the same Guess thats why he thinks were in a simulation Wowzer,
Is that why mt roblox exploits worked when i did god mode,
Us God is amazing Hes done all sorts of cool things and is our ruler God No Im just some nerd playing a video game,
People seem to be misunderstanding the concept of being a part of a simulated universe You arent a player character no one is controlling you You are a nonplayable character AKA an NPC A good way to think about it is imagine NPCs in video games Now imagine an NPC so advanced that it has consciousness artificial intelligence and an entire life within the confines of the game Thats what you are There doesnt necessarily have to be anyone actually PLAYING either A simulation can be run for a variety of purposes only a few of which require actually jumping in and taking part in the simulation,
So counterfeit money is just a duplication glitch,
whos gonna be the first guy to access the console and write noclip 1,
*SWORD ART ONLINE ALICIZATION*,
Maybe Im wrong but isnt there a fourth possibility We are not in a simulation rather we are the humans that will create the first one,
LolI dont get it Whats the need to simulate ourselves,
I always lag out when I have to go to work,
MY CRUSH BROUGHT ME HERE,
To my creator its motherload,
I have a question for elon musk Can he give me the cheat codes for infinite money,
So when we die we get banned xD,
*TELL US SOME CHEAT CODES THEN*,
Because his fanboy sycophants will believe anything he says,
we could be in a simulation and all the errors that we make in our life our choices the mistakes we make in our math tests are bugs in the system wah,
I believe the reason why we do not figure things out is this Creators mainframe God Universes Our Universe Planet E Human B  mainframe God mainframereplication Universes Our Universe Planet E Human B So god is human The great creators might or might not Could they be post humans or outdated versions of AI Who knows the answer I want to hear it,
The person controlling me needs to use motherlode cheat,
Well the girl playing me sucks,
If we are in a simulation then who which thing is controlling us  Then how that thing is born  In where  Then the thing which controlling in where that living if its just like a simulation game in a PC then how we can escape from the monitor or CPU then how that world formed before forming what happened  Damndamn Its endless no way to know,
I guess that would explain why there are so many bugs,
Graphics are realistic gameplay sucks and community is toxic The guy who controls me is a casual noob player,
If somebody sins Jesus bans the for stream sniping,
Musk is 100 correct go to nderfcom check out actual near death studies and the similarly of the stories identical Use Oculus go for a few weeks and will see this is definitely not the base reality,
plot twist  elon musk achieved CHIM,
If this is a simulation then can I have admin,
What if the gamer decides to pull the plug,
What if the gamer decides to pull the plug,
*Hello if any one simulating me then please resume the simulation I am stuck at point maybe cuz of ur pause break*,
Nah we are in a sim but its the sim our brain gives us,
i feel like im an alt account that my player abandoned,
Im in need of a money glitch,
what if the simulation is evolving as well as we who live in it never to be able to understand it no matter how much we progress,
controlling humans doesnt sound cool,
Criminals could start blaming their behaviour on their controllers,
Heres what I got to say to my player Youre a noob,
Everything is really a giant mystery The part of not knowing answers and then dying still not knowing bugs me no end,
My guy might have faulty remote controller,
I had the same thoughy when I was younger When the sims was trending But I thought the it was absurd,
You would always want to have base simulations in action especially for long term security as a fall back back up plan,
Is commiting suicide just exiting and saving wtf,
*Owner of the stimulation*  Ok lets see what should we add here *Elon musk*  Were stimulated *Owner of the stimulation*  wtf is this a virus,
Take the blue *NO I DONT DO DRUGS*,
The guys behind Rick and Morty knew everything,
Were in a simulation Gamemode 1,
So basically Rick was right,
Why did I get an impeach trump ad before the vid started,
Everything seem too good Were living on a planet with basically anything we needed with right temperature etc,
If we lived in a simulation which Part of me wish we were Then things like instant teleportation time travel and many impossible things are possible I always thought the easy way for those things to happen is living in a virtual world like the Oasis of Ready Player One Eventually it will become undistinguishable from reality and thats like a door to a whole new level of things,
I agree with eloncuz we are live in a simulation and god controlling everything and have the script for the world,
Welp time for my weekly existential crisis,
So this explains why trump NPCs exist,
Why did god not give me gamemode 1,
the rick and morty theory simulation in simulation in simulation,
The point of exercise is to replace fat with muscle not just lose weight,
In summary it is not feasible to outwork a bad diet,
This video is kind of biased It talks about cardiovascular exercises like Jogging and Cycling What they do is burn calories directly But what they missed out was looking at High Intensity exercises like Sprinting and Lifting weights Lifting weights builds muscle mass in your body And this in turn increases the work your body has to put into utilizing the muscles and thus increases your Resting Metabolism which happens to also be the number 1 factor in affecting the calories you burn Not to discredit the video but they were absolutely right in saying that diet ultimately is the main issue but they shouldnt say that exercising is ineffective,
Youll definitely look better if you workout to lose weight vs just dieting lol,
American media Step 1 everything you know is wrong Step 2 heres something you already know but framed in a new way Step 3 walk back what you said in step 1 a bit to CYA Step 4  profit ,
All you need to do is 100 Push ups100 Sit ups100 Squats and 10km running,
19K gym owners disliked this,
Exercise is useless when it comes to weight loss  And I immediately unliked the video,
Dont join on Jan 1 it is way to crowded On Jan 14 the new members are gone and it is back to the regulars I dont know about other people but exercising does seem to make me lose weight I even eat better I crave sugar less I think I look at sugary foods and associate the calories with how long I would have to work to burn them off So I think twice I do agree that we should work towards collective solutions like making our food healthier But I definitely dont think they should be discouraging people from exercising Without movement our bodies die much more quickly,
Ive lost 20 pounds in 18 days by limiting my calories to 1200 a day and working out twice a day I feel pretty good about myself and I feel like working out everyday contributes more than anything,
This sounds pretty defeating Ill just stay on the couch and eat less,
The secret Workout Eat well Sleep well Spend sometime with your family Be happy You will be better and lose fats whilst having a good life,
Exercise in this video talk is about only burning calories by running or cycling They dont mention lifting weights To increase the bar for resting metabolism lift heavy weights to gain muscle When you increase the size of your muscles you can increase your intake of food because you need more calories to maintain your muscles With that you are able to burn more calories even when you are resting referring to resting metabolism,
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ONLY ACCOUNTS 10 TO 30 IN ENERGY USE MAN 30 IS A LOT,
i hope people get that the point of the video is not to stop exercising altogether but that exercise alone is not enough and maintaining a healthy diet is also necessary,
I literally had no exercise at all Everyday go to work and walk Just normal work routine 45L water a day 24hours I eat low carb and high fat I eat less than 1600 calories a day I have lost 14KG in the pas 3 months From 90KG to 76KG And i still keep going until reach my ideal weight which is 65KG Wish me luck,
Just Stop Eating And you dont have to pushup situp squat whatever,
Its around 80 percent diet Starvation or caloric deprivation causes weight loss,
Come on the vast majority of Americans need to change their diet for the better and you all know it to be true You really can basically undo your hour long run on the treadmill with one slice of pizza Its literally that simple We have to eat better people theres no getting around it And of course the top ten percent of people that are ALREADY athletic and in good health will talk about how they are outliers and how much of an exception they are,
I am studying as an undergraduate about to finish my degree in exercise Physiology at Kennesaw State University This video though mostly true leaves out some very important details Exercise is extremely important to overall health and eating is extremely important for weight control However the research done here is interpreted in a way that downplays the effects ofexercise on weight The effects of exercise go far beyond the acuteie the right there and theneffects of a single workout Exercise will burn a small amount of calories during a workout but the small amounts of damage and trauma done to the body during a regular bout of exercise need time and energy to repair Your body has to recover and repair itself after every workout This can almost double the energy expended in the workout sometimes Resistance training is a great example You burn very few calories lifting weights but as the body rebuilds itself and prepares for the next bout it uses so much more energy throughout the rest of the day even into the next day that the effects are magnified Not only is this working in your advantage but also when new muscle tissue is created itbegins demanding nutrients regularly and adds to your Basal Metabolic Rate or the amount of energy you require just to maintain your current body weight So you burn more fat in your sleep Even though the effects may not be as blatantly obvious for weight loss as slowlystarving yourself until you reach a goal weight exercise plays a huge and irreplaceable role in weight management,
The reduction in resting metabolism is actually true I sleep much less when exercising everyday But on days when i dont workout i sleep much longer and better,
Losing 5 pounds a month  That sounds pretty good Thats how much you should aim to lose,
How to increases RMR exercise specifically weight lifting,
No killer workout can replace caloric restriction and saying goodbye to sugar junk carbs transfats soda fast food junk food convenience food Harvard University and numerous other scientific research organizations proved that aerobic and anerobic exercise did little to lower body fat However instead of sitting on ones ass watching a screen of any kind take up ordinary movement Walking housework cutting grass parking at the far end away from the store and walking are the only exercise a person eating a restricted calorie diet actually needs,
Mental health benefits are the best thing about exercise IMO,
This video confirmed what my doctor told me a few years ago What u eat is way more important than working out at the gym,
active workout also improves metabolismwhich lead to weight loss,
I agree i changed my diet just 3 days in lost 5lbs and i have also gained weight training very hard cardio and weight training but obviously taking in way to many calories But if you wanna be muscular and hard looking u gotta train or be skinny and flabby like jarred from Subway,
For people confused Of coarse exercise isnt going to work if you lose say 200 calories then go to a fastfood place and gain 800 calories,
Eat less move more lose weight Pretty simple,
Working out is also therapeutic When you sweat and go out of breath your body releases hormones that actually make you feel happier and feel better,
To lose weight you cant just do exercise you have to combine it with a good diet and running burns more calories than taking the stairs,
so amI mistaken or did this study just totally ignore muscle mass and its effects on resting metabolism,
i totally flipped out I thought I lost my phone at gym I think I am to stressed,
Exercise does help you lose weight but you can not out exercise a bad diet Not going to happen,
What your body could be doing is moving the calories from Physical Activities to Resting Metabolism because your body will think that your workouts are essential for you to survive,
how come I lose more than 14 kg from cardio  what u are talking about,
well thermodynamics,
Weight loss tip 1 Less calories in more calories out through calories tracking based on weight age height,
Agree with the vid but the best thing about exercise is that it motivates you to eat healthier plus it improves mental health,
This video does not even reference the fact that one type of exercise resistance training can build enough muscle to significantly increase your BMR,
Exercise maintain and build muscle in the body The more muscle means more mitochondria mitochondria burns fat But muscle has massweight so it doesnt show to much progress in the scale Its effective to make yourself look good in the mirror but not to look good in the scale Simple and thats that,
Despite knowing this to be true I continue to workout like a horse but still eat and look like a pig Nice,
the people that are selling crack are telling their customers to go to the gym,
The video isnt saying not to exercise Its saying that based on whatever studies they cite those studies found that exercising alone does not necessarily lead to results It is true that losing weight is as simple as calories in  calories out and exercising increases calories out however human behaviour takes a toll People tend to justify eating more or eating worse because they exercised In this case while theyre increasing calories out theyre also increasing calories in Theyre not saying its impossible to lose weight by just exercising only that its a lot harder and requires a lot more focus and self control than most people have Changing the way we eat and our approach to food is in the opinion of the studies this video cites a more sustainable and effective way to lose weight At the end of the day everyone needs to find what works for them,
Doesnt more muscle mass increases your metabolism,
So how do they stay slim They dont overeat Me Okay Ill become an anorexic,
YES lawmakers should be responsible for what I eat Good thinking,
 excellent tagline Why working out is great for health but not for weight loss,
Im gonna start smoking so I can stop best thing I can do for myself,
Brian Gantick Great analysis you nailed it Also strict fasting tends to slow down your basal metabolic rate since your body sees this as a time to conserve energy,
Exercise is for muscles Just be fit and eat healthy,
17k people who bought a gym pass disliked the video dont worry I also have one but the video izgud,
healthy eating is the most important tip then exercise is for having strong healthy body,
MISLEADING VIDEO This is is talking about aerobic exercise because anaerobic exercise leads to muscle gain If you have a larger muscle mass then you have a greater resting metabolism So you can lose fat if you gain some muscle,
WHYYY ITS SOOO MUCH MORE EASY TOdo exercise then diet,
building muscle increases your metabolic rate,
They never say that exercise wont help you lose weight They say that exercise is harder to lose weight If you workout a lot but eat a lot of junk food Then you will have hard time losing weight We all know that exercise is good for you but for losing weight it is not the only option Remember that diet is also very important,
exercise makes me more full If I was hungry at first after a 30 min light cardio Im super full,
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT a minute Im a fitness instructor and all my fancy textbooksteacherspersonal experience show that the more muscle you have the higher your resting metabolism And how do you gain more muscle You workout So YES exercise helps you lose weight just not quite the way we thought Seriously I lost 30lbs through cardio I promise it works,
Weight lifting is a form of exercise If you develop more lean muscle tissue it increases your resting metabolism to sustain muscle Which they stated is the most effective consumption of daily energy needs ,
Pointless video Losing weight depends on the balance between incoming energy and burning energy If we assume that an average person burns aprox 1800 caloriesday that person needs to consume less calories than this ammount in order to lose weight Each calorie corresponds to a quantity of body weight We can lose weight either by increasing our calories burning rythm which can be done most effectivelly by excersise and by decreasing our food consumption in terms of calories intake Of course if we increase both intake and burning by the same ammount the balance doesnt change but it is ridigelous to blame excersise about it The most efficient way to lose weight is to excersise a bit to increase the daily calorie burn by excersise and to decrease the energy consumption simultaneously Excersise alongside a proper diet works better because the weight loss is undoubtedly faster and healthier maintaining or even increasing muscle mass and lossing only fat in comparison with diet alone,
As some others have said mostly true Simply put weight loss is about expending more energy than what is consumed Doesnt matter whether thats eating less or exercising more That said metabolic function has been grossly simplified in the video While it is true that the body can and will adapt to exercise it takes awhile for this to happen This is why resistance training requires changing things up changing acute variables such as volume resistance tempo etc But the body also adjusts to eating less It will also cause your Basal Metabolic Rate to go down And for that reason this video gets it majorly wrong If you lose weight through food onlyprimarily the metabolic adaptations will be worse than theyd be if you did so onlyprimarily via exercise especially resistance training At some point your body will start burning lean muscle and that will be problematic because lean muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain and thus your BMR will go down The reality is that the better way to lose weight is to eat less eat a better variety of nutrientdense foods and exerciseespecially resistance training But what do I know I only lost 150 lbs,
So combining good nutrition with exercise is key What is new,
You can increase your resting metabolism by adding muscle mass Bad science,
I was under the impression that more muscle mass means a higher amount of calories needed at rest And I took one anatomyphysiology class in college yo,
I went to a dietist because I needed to lose a little weight She told me to eat healthy and to workout even if the food you eat is more important HELLO My name is MIKIWAWA btw ,
*Only 30 of your calories are in your control* Like 30 is nothing,
YOU CANT OUTRUN YOUR FORK,
I lost more than 50 pounds by just exercising and not really changing my diet So yeah God bless everyone,
We shouldnt let people find out the truth otherwise theyll never move,
Lifting qeights is the best way More muscle u have the more calories burned at a stand still and u gain muscle,
Whole foodsIntermittent FastingProblem solved,
you guys do know that strength training raises your resting metabolic rate right,
ok but havent studied shown that the more physical activity you do and the more fit you becomethe more muscle mass you have your resting metabolic rate increases,
I use the treadmill 2 hours,
Raise your metobolic rate by doing two days a week full body heavy weight lifting two days a week interval traing and one to two days a week steady state cardio 45 minutes  like brisk walking AND dont pig out  Trust me you will feel better mentally  you will look better because you will have more muscle and bone densityyour knees will strengthen up  you wont pee your pants when you cough or sneeze your mysterious arthritis will vanish you may even throw away your antidepressantsadjust your diet lower your fat intake reduce carbs lots of veggies fruits lean p rotiens In other words Lifestyle changesno dieting,
Im freaking adult if the government tries to take away my big mac and fries Im starting another godamn civil war,
fat people use this as an excuse for not trying to slim down and saying its not their fault,
The lady sounds like Cardi B,
100 push ups 1 calorie 10 hours of running maybe 20 calories A month or eat disorder Maybe 6 pounds,
Cardio is not optimal for weight loss but resistance training will increase your metabolism so on the long term it is the best solution to keep excess fat off your bodyalso the thermogenic effect is so minimal its not even something people should look at and its the same if you have one big 2500kcal meal or five 500kcal meals,
in short we are what we eat  simple o,
But working out creates more muscle tissue overtime This muscle tissue burns alot more calories compared to the isolating fat cells even when you are just doing nothing,
I dont count my calories etc but I work out mostly everyday and I still have a big stomach its crazy,
I lost 90 pounds last year and did the same amount of exercise I did for the previous 25 year What changed was I eliminated sugar and flour from my diet I also weighed my food on a food scale So eat healthy food Eliminate unhealthy food And BTW dont overexercise Cause too much exercise causes hunger,
since I watched this video I stopped working out and gained 20 POUNDS I realized this and decided to go on a change diet and exercise and lost 30 pounds,
Intermittent fasting is how huntergatherers keep lean It is endurance conditioning that modern diets have compromised,
i got an ad telling me to start exercising and stop watching youtube videos,
whole food vegan diet is the best to maintain health the planet and a good body shape,
Sedentrios a falarem de exerccio fsico hilariante,
Your BMR can absolutely be altered over time Guess what happens when you gain muscle BMR goes up and your maintenance calories rise as well Videos like this allow people to stay lazy and feel like victims of their own body when the reality is far from that,
Michael Greger Neil Barnard John Mc Dougal,
I lost 8kg by being on keto and watching videos lmao,
Three glasses of wine damn alcoholics,
Intermittent fasting helps if you start in your 20s30s,
I lost 50 pounds through excercise without changing my diet but I do work out for about 2 hours a day,
There is some awesome information in this but to say exercise is actually pretty useless when it comes to weight lose They never mention how exercise nd muscle gain increase your metabolic rate Which is as this video shows the most important form of weight lose next to diet,
brah if you lift weights and do cardio for sure you will lose weight this video is just an excuse,
Excercise weightlift for more muscle also be in a calorie deficit,
Or just have a speed up methabolism and eat whatever you want lool,
5 pounds at most in the month You should only be losing about 2 lbs at max a week,
The key is to exercise up to 8 hours a day and still eat minimally until you collapse,
This video made me start doing intermitten fasting Its been 2 years and I lost about 20kg without much effort  besides changing the way I eat of course I have my regular portion meals 1218 hours apart I dont stress about it I keep it flexible yet consistent Within a week my body got use to it and Ive been fine ever since Tq Vox,
CocaCola marketing has left the chat room,
the bicycle thing ride a bicycle in austin texas for 15 mins and your gonna not be able to walk or move afterward uphill downhill uphill uphill yeah were not talking slight hills,
Seems like the key is mostly portion control specially at night that our metabolism is so slow,
For weight loss Eat low calorie diet For strong physique exercise,
Wow perfect voice,
1 Nutrition 2 Exercise 3 Be consistent,
It takes one look at a chart with energy expenditures for various activities to come to the same conclusion Pretty trivial video presented in a clickbaity manner,
Videos all over the place a bunch of nonsense Ive lost around 30 lb I did it by exercising dieting both of which are extremely important and they go handinhand and perseverance which is more important than the first two,
By working out your muscle mass increases which leads to an increase of your basal metabolism,
Working out increases your resting metabolism if done right Obviously diet matters also,
One thing to say Michael Phelps,
This is a great topic to cover Please post more like this in the future Excellent,
The thumbnail is so misleading It should be flagged Eattrainsleep If you get these 3 in a healthy controllable pace Then you should be healthy,
i am bothered and unbothered by her voice all at the same time,
Exercise isnt the best way to lose weight *The sky isnt blue*,
204 so distracted by the reflection on the spoon,
If you exercise regularly you are training your will too,
Heres a solution when your hungry after a big workout drink a LOT of water till you feel full,
proper nutrition and exercise combined WILL help you lose weight this info here is so counterproductive now all fatties will have another excuse not to exercise,
This is such poor reasoning You absolutely can control how many calories you expend Keep moving until you get to the number you are aiming for,
Just dont eat meat stay away from soda and dont smoke Eat fruit and vegetables I dont understand why its so difficult for Americans,
Whos exercising while watching Me,
To lose weight    eat less and move more,
When you build lean muscles at the gym you get higher metabolism,
If you want a 6 pack or get buff then you need to do excersise,
you can speed up you metabolism she said you cant control it,
18K gym rats had their world shattered,
Exercise will increase your metabolism plus what youve burned in the session So you burn more for just resting after exercising This video is missing some facts,
Claiming to have read 60 studys is not evidence Stating that exercise comprises a tiny fraction of daily energy burn and going on to say the number is 10 to 30 Thats not tiny its significant Guess what if you work out for 90 minutes a day the number becomes very significant A man running an hour a day looses 5 pounds in a week Thats a lot What if you did this for ten weeks The touted expert who probably wrote the studies she references in the titles telling you how time consuming weight loss by exercise is and how quickly you can erase your workout The average canadian watches 30 hour of television a week What do you think would happen if they took ten of the thirty and added it to their weekly exercise Theyd lose weight significant weight Yes diet is equally important you must align the two but I categorically reject the premise of this presentation Julia Belluz you need to check your own biases Your compiling evidence to support ideas you already identify with,
Vigorous exercise builds muscle Larger muscles use more energy,
I get feeling to ignore what the video say,
Way to move the goalposts Resistance exercise increases lean body mass muscle and as such increases your basal metabolic rate Not to mention the cascading effect it has on things like insulin sensitivity Your diet AND exercise regimes are important for maintaining a healthy weight and active participation in a sport is the easiest way to get your arse training Dont neglect it,
I exercise so I can eat more,
Before you watch this video just know that their saying that you shouldnt over eat their I saved you 444 minutes of your life,
Probably the most demotivating video I have come across in a long time,
this womans voice is the audio equivalent to moldy gravy,
Exactly So good food and exercise together is great right,
idk about anyone else but working out makes me feel better and crave healthier food after running for a week I dont feel like eating a burger or pizza I feel like sipping a smoothie,
The science is in Exercise isnt the best way to lose weight Where was this sciences pulled from someones arse,
So my workout was high intensity and lasted for 40 minutes I burned 1200 calories according to my watch and was soaked through Exercise definitely helps loose weight,
 Volume  key word If you eat ONE of our new fangled hamburgers you can replace the calories youve just burned from a 5 FIVE mile walk or run  think about it,
Dancing and wine drinking They go together Lol,
This entire video Im just waitin for the conclusion on what to actually do,
Please make a video about intermittent fasting,
I lose 5 pounds every time I run hard for 15 min,
I dont know aye i started to cycle for 2 hours a day and lost 20kg in 6 months No changes to diet or any other part of my routine,
This is not true once you establish good endurance fitness Problem is most beginners are too heavy or not conditioned to take advantage of it,
Summary put down the fork,
Energy in and Energy out,
I agree with the information I have personally tried the run it off method for calories To date my body has adjusted every time to maintain the current status In short running is a good calorie burner but it does not make you thin Your diet does,
lose it app really works i lost 10 pounds in 3 weeks eating less calories keeping track of all i eat eating small meals its great,
This is bs lmao Ive lost 50 lbs so far just by getting a labor job and being on my feet for hrs a day I also eat 2x as much now,
this video motivated all the lazy people out there Yeah so got good likes XD,
Human xp daily cap,
Vox you should be prosecuted for disseminating inaccurate information that could have huge health consequences and for straight up lying,
This is in line with my experienceexercise is awesome beautiful way to connect with your body and enjoy life but for a weight loss the best strategy is mindful calory intake,
Studies,
The point of the video is that you shouldnt be surprised if you dont lose weight with exercise if you continue to eat too much especially fast food not that exercise is bad or useless despite what the video said it was just to get your attention A healthy diet is necessary for success and I dont mean those fad diets I mean changing the way you eat for good If its something that only lasts a few months the chances are your weight will come back,
this guy has got the darkest eyes that ive ever seen gives me heebie jeebies,
I lost so much weight as a great side effect to mountain bikingunintentionally and I still ate about the same Must be metabolism,
I lost 18kg in 3 months without workout just close your mouth easy,
Good now I can quit the gym,
I think the point of exercise is mainly about increasing your basal metabolism,
its not that they dont over eats its just that theres is not enough food for them to overeat,
There are no sources hmm yeah i doubt this,
I watched this video  and then proceeded to lose 70lbs in 10months,
to balance the video If u do strength training your muscles grow and they raise your resting metabolism Also sports may reduce stress so u may eat less,
they need to make healthy food just as affordable as junk food then we could see a differencemaybe,
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INCREASES THE RESTING METABOLISMDAH IT DOESNT BURN MUCH CALORIES ITSELF BUT MAKES YOUR BODY BURNS MORE CALORIES,
Exercising is still important though,
Implying people who did even 5 minutes of research didnt already knew that,
I think you can find good solution on Avasva,
A bit misleading Diet *and* exercise are the keys to weight loss They didnt even bother mentioning how strengthtraining for muscles will increase your metabolism,
I like the saying You cant outrun the fork,
Why do lawmakers have to do anything My weight is my responsibility not theirs and I wont have them exert anymore control over my life,
This is why 1 mastication 2 plantbaseddiet 3omad is so effective in weight loss Exercise is good for strength endurance and relaxation,
Shes beautiful,
Food is medicine Many are overdosing on it,
Ok I get it Working out doesnt make you lose weight Fat sure But actual lbs not so much Lets remember muscles weigh more than fat The more muscle mass you have the more weight you may gain I weighed almost 200 lbs before I started working out with HIIT CrossFit mostly I did that for about 3 years I gained serious muscles my body transformed and got thinner in some areas thicker in others And if I was ONLY looking at the scale I would have ONLY seen about 20 lbs difference However this doesnt account for the muscle mass gained or the bone density gained Only numbers So before we go around saying that exercising doesnt work lets look are ALL of the components And yes there may be other things that a body is dealing with like thyroid issues adrenal gland issues etc,
Why im watching this Im already slim,
Of course the answer is to have the government regulate our food environment,
Exercise helps you lose weight but it mostly helps you build muscle and become stronger,
Drink dirty river water with bacteria lose weight,
I am 21 but my fitness is 61 years old sooo saaad ,
Diet works exercise works both together work the best,
yes agree ahuh policy makers should improve our food environment  What Oh right its Vox so of course going after McDs and Coke is the solution not me just watching what I eat,
Why should we take Good for your Health for granted,
Resting metabolism is increased due to exercisestay woke,
See those hunters in Tanzania thats what a fit body looks like and its hot All these gym guys need someone to tell them the truth,
Government doesnt need to regulate food people need to have some discipline and make good choices,
This is extremely misleading By doing exercise you increase muscle and that causes your body to burn more calories at rest,
Double the exercise and half the calories intake increase accordingly as needed,
228 As people start to slim down their resting metabolism can slow down This is a terrible speech the unclear sentence may misguided people to knowing the truth easily the most important factor of basal metabolic rate is depend on your muscle mass not the stupid number on the scale,
I dont get hungry after a gym session  green tea helps alot,
Someone please give this lady a cough drop,
What you eat is the most important part of losing weight If you eat unhealthy and exercise you probably wont lose as much fat as someone who hardly exercise but eat healthy,
Comunism helps a lot thanks to that no one of my family has overweight not obesity,
What theyre saying is basically dont eat crap food Wow How revolutionary D,
its hard to be on a healthy diet when my bf keeps putting food in front of my face i think its time to break up kappa,
They just simply ignored the fact that exercising increases the basal metabolism rate,
So its true an apple a day keeps the doctor away BUT JUST AN APPLE NOTHING ELSE STOP EATING JESUS,
Its worth spending this 5 minutes you wasted to commute to your gym,
The only exercises they mention were aerobiccardio what about weight lifting Weight lifting increases muscle mass which then increases your metabolic rate Aka burns more calories even when you are at rest,
Wow look at the cheeks of that presenter She is thin but has a super round face Kinda odd,
Depressing god damn video,
Losing weight are made in the kitchen Strength are built in the gym,
But I actually lose 20kg in 7 months by cycling and running treadmill,
Just to summarize this for everyone If you exercise youll still reduce your weight even with the same diet as you have but it will take longer If you change your diet to healtier foods youll lose weight as well depending on how bad your diet was you can lose a lot of weight or very little Combining exercise and changes in your diet are the key to weight lose and overall a healthier lifestyle I myself lost about 15 pounds in a couple of months because I cut out soda and fast food which I used to eat everyday and then procided to gain back 10 pounds over the next 4 months because Ive been exercisinglifting as well Everything I saw in this video I already knew because I like to be well informed on subjects that interest me I would like to point out that if you are interested in working out consider supplements like beta alanine and creatine together because they help with muscle growth and that will increase your resting metabolism alonf with helping you lose weight Also I just want to point out choose a healthy diet that will promote healthy weight loss and not a crazy crash diet where you will lose weight crazy fast by say eating only 600800 calories a day and drinking tons of water because those diets dont work and once you get off them youll inevitable gain back the weight,
Vox is the best place for fitness advice,
This is some bullshit Last year I was 15 and I was 280 pounds I started to work out and I lost 1039 pounds now Im buff and skinny I feel better and Im healthy,
Jesus Christ just be under your caloric maintenance to lose body fat,
What Exercise sports must be good for health,
So what is the best way to loose weight Diet AAAND exercise I knew that,
What astonishing science Exercising high intensity with intermittent fasting will get you the best results,
One hundred pushups one hundred situps AND 100 SQUATS A DAY AND 10 KILOMETERS Also No AC,
The point of exercise in going down on weight is to build and maintain enough muscle to burn the greater amounts of calories that you eat It is the muscle not the exercise itself that makes you slim but you need the exercise to keep the muscle so in the end nothing much changes,
When it comes to health  nutrition there is always one source of information and another source contradicting the other It is literally everywhere Best advice Try out different diets workouts etc and do and stick with what works for your own body,
cals in vs cals out its not very complicated,
Wait so we shouldnt workout,
What about those of us who are trying to bulk Could you make a video about that,
lift weights builds muscle and that will burn more calories in your resting state cardio sucks,
1030 of your energy goes towards physical exercise And they dont think thats a lot Thats a whole meal Jeezum,
Im a pinnacle of physical fitness my doc asks me for fitness advice,
420 229 for 2 ltrs of Coke If it ever reaches that price here in a grocery store where I live Missouri Im off of it,
discipline and self respectthats all you need,
This is just a stupid clickbait Weight loss Its about exercise basic human body adaptation combined with good nutrition in a caloric deficit,
Unfortunately this entire study is flawed There doesnt seem to be any knowledge on the physiological and muscular adaptations to the body through progressive overload,
Im laughing while watching this,
You care more about being clickbait and getting views,
what about hormones that are influenced by training Video has some point but not rly,
The more you exercise  the more you build muscleand muscle mass has more basal metabolic rate and thus people can burn more calories,
the bottom line we should learn how to control and discipline ourselves in the quality and quantity of or food and drink intake Now this is the HARD part ,
Yes I agree on this,
How did I know that Kevin Hall would say slice of pizza,
Started at 2899  20 minutes a day cause I was very out of shape got to 30 minutes a day now doing 30 minutes a day on the treadmill at 35 speed and 10 incline and Im down to 2672 in 3 months,
Best way to lose weight is to stop eating,
19k triggered gym rats,
Welp no more gym for me now i can internet troll 247 ,
who else went for a cigarrette when the guy said stopping smoking at 030 ,
17k people who disagree said that their gym membership is a futile move,
This video obscures two crucial points about health and exercise 1 Your basal metabolic rate is under your control and anaerobic exercise is how you control it This video talks about exercise as if aerobic exercise were the only kind that counted Anaerobic exercise eg weight lifting rock climbing etc will add muscle which will raise your resting calorie consumption 2 Weight is not the primary health risk Body fat percentage is the primary health risk Weight is easier and more satisfying to measure But the fast ways of losing weight all cause muscle loss which will sabotage your basal metabolic rate See point 1,
They need to distinguish between aerobic exercise and anerobic hypertrophyinducing exercise The former will consume sugar and fat stores The latter will consume sugar and fat stores but also raise your bmr increasing base level burned,
I knew it resting is the best thats what I keep saying,
Yes so whats the solution Just dont eat ,
I just cant believe that a smart person like me got clickbaited,
The real solution is to go vegan Low fat high carb and high fiber diet Dont you feel the same,
Explain the marathon runners bodies ,
I automatically eat healthier when I exercise regularly,
Exercise is still good for you Reduces risk of heart disease and osteoporosis,
Best way to lose weight is by not eating worked for Eugenia Cooney,
Exercising actually reduces hunger,
Well it needs a proper diet too but a proper diet is not just about cutting calories as even that can be counterproductive because it can lower the metabolism rate However a 30 minute workout daily is among the best health options you can choose,
i agree with this,
America America Always finding ways to increase your obesity,
Vox if youre going to mention research then please provide links to said research so that we can verify it ourselves,
The GOVERNMENT needs to tell people how to make healthy food choices ROTFLMAOrightthats like taking income tax advice from Willie Nelson,
this lady talks like Cardi B hahah,
At 415 it hit me The message is stop eating sugar The nanny state should help people protect themselves from themselves Thanks vox Push those public works into fascist policies Your grandchildren will love the road you paved for them,
When you find something to hold on to ,
One more reason I am happy that I live in the Netherlands Europe and not in the United States with their stupid department of agriculture,
the main reason is foodcalories came from what we take,
At 443 the total percentage adds up to 1063  Something is wrong in the data LOL,
Just dont eat as much damn it Gluttony is everywhere these days,
And with this video Ive decided to never watch anything from vox again,
Lots wrong with this presentation A recent study demonstrated that dying leads to weight loss in 100 of the subjects studied While further research is necessary this study indicates that suicide is the most successful approach to weight loss The above is meant to illustrate where research lacking in thought leads to false conclusions,
diet  exercise  sleep,
Wow kills me I dont want to workout any more,
Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder but dont nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weights  Ronnie,
Truly I have never seen a fat running enthusiast,
Obvious statement is obvious but sure for *purely* losing weight exercise isnt the best way as a standalone option You exercise you gain muscle weight you burn fat less weight than muscle Thing is the better physical shape you get in the more efficient your body becomes at burning stored fat and retaining or building muscle which provides physical and mental health benefits as well as a reduction in visceral fat which is more important than simply focusing on losing weight Only exercise as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your diet as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your sleeping habits isnt best If you have excessive body fat the best solution to eliminate that excessive fat is to combine proper exercise with proper healthy foods with proper sleeping patterns Human physiology isnt meant to handle sitting at a desk for 8 hours then sitting in a car for an hour then sitting on the sofa at home watching TV for the rest of the evening while drinking sugary garbage,
Its the opposite You exercise you eat more beacuse you need the fuckign calories duh,
Also something worth mentioning is your brain uses over 20 of your energy which theyve probably lumped in with Resting metabolism Make sure you get your mental exercise in too,
or disconnect the pie hole intake vacuum as the easiest way but thats just me,
That girl is from moon where the weight 16th No worries,
Hell 5 lbs per month every month sounds awesomethats 60lbs per year Plus it teaches healthy habits,
136 First of all 5 pounds a month is nothing to sneeze at Second of all he would look more than 5 pounds thinner because hes turning more of his body weight into muscle weight which is more dense,
Nutrition is the most important for weight loss Exercise is great for health and keeping your body healthy,
Thats why I recommend meth,
So What was the point of this Video What is the conclusion Youve defined a problem so what is the solution,
dont get confused eat healthy 1st and do exercise you can lose more wight be gaining more muscles so exercise and eat to grow your muscles and spread the message,
We can start with more video like thisthank you,
I got this calorie counting app where I log what I eat and it tells me how much I have eaten I think thats the best then,
I think the right idea is to watch what you eat and still exercise regularly I used to enjoy working out I dont know why I stopped,
The real answer is Eat less and cut down on food,
just drop 1000 cals a day from your diet Ive lost loads of weight without ever breaking a sweat at the gym,
Totally useless VDO Whats the point of the VDO its all negative and nothing positive or good advice,
What about the idea that exercise can increase or temporarily boost your resting metabolism,
sooooooo just eat healthierless,
Cut sugar grains and as much corn as you can That helps a lot Joe Rogan Experience guys come on Haha,
Its honestly a bit silly to say two donuts  1 hour of rigorous exercise If your aim is to lose weight you wouldnt be going off and having a donut Thats just dumb,
Build bigger muscles and you increase your resting metabolism,
So wtf is the answer huh  Just talked about all the bullst i have already known,
Actually actually actually actually actually actually,
This biased research really makes me angry,
Eat less junk and work out more ,
YESSS Finally I know for a fact that me and all the other lazy people have been waiting for this study our entire lives,
The US had no idea what it was doing in Iraq after 2003 Well said sir well said,
Can we get a 2019 version A lot has happened since this video came out,
Why does every war include USA in some or the other way,
Calling Saudia Arabia secular is a joke,
Ottoman empire im not feeling good Western countries hippity hoppity this is now my property,
Didnt the US support Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran Why leave that detail out,
Arabs and persians hate each other even before islam came So its not necessarily sunni and shia war its arabs Vs persains before its sunni Vs shia,
Hey Vox can we please get an update,
The US Britain and France have created a mess in the Middle East that they cant clean up,
Americans are very good at blowing stuff up They are less good at understanding where the pieces fall once theyre done,
A proxy war  Iran vs Saudi Arabia  but that proxy war is also the proxy war of USA Saudi Arabia vs Russia  Iran What a weird world we live in,
USA just need to get the f*** out of middle east thats the only solution to stop this mess cuz USA is supporting the war,
Its USA the terrorist country making Cold War in the Middle East,
Dont forget wadiyah the most cruel dictator still rules there,
Iraq was doing great until 2003 we all know what happened Libyans were living a wealthy lifestyle until the west screwed them over Syria 90 of its population are educated and it had over 100 universities Yemen a country known for its historical architecture its one of a few countries that lies on two continents it haves natural resources such as oilgasgold its known for its sea exports and agricultural production we all know its wealthy neighbors and their allies deprived Yemen from developing from exporting its goods from importing anything cratered a siege that caused a famine When you say failed states tell us why what caused it,
How did you escape from Saudis *Iran*,
Its difficult to get everything in in a short space of time but one would think that the impact of British colonialism the creation of Israel and the continued interference by the US and now Russia  Turkey would have a bigger place in this analysis This short video doesnt really show that the socalled Proxy states are THEMSELVES Proxy Without US backing Saudi Arabia would not be able to get away with what it is doing and now with Israel playing a more destructive role,
This is all Britain and Frances fault they were the ones who colonized and destabilized the area after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire Btw your map of the Ottoman Empire at 155 is horribly inaccurate,
There is also a soft cold war between saudis and qatar qatar supports the muslim brotherhood and revolutions in the arab world and saudis are against Both are sunnis and backed by the US btw,
found oil and got allied with USA ofc,
The reason for the US intervention is so that they better exports their arms weapons US The biggest exporter of arms had wrapped the world piece directly or indirectly,
Why is there no mention of Israel and USA who really are behind these wars,
Iran and SA are doing the same thing to third world countries that US and Soviet Union did,
news sunni vs shia UK citizens who gives a crap,
oooh a political video about the middle east The comments will have more salt reserves than Saudi has oil,
thanks to france and england the Middle East is seperated,
Iran and Saudi look good But both of their leaders are ruthless dictators who dreamed to reunite the middle east in their own regime,
us to iraq Hey IrAq wAnt SomE deMocRaCy US *creates proxy war totally not on purpose*,
In much of the Islamic world when Sunni and Shia lived in close proximity they got along famously well *Stares aggressively at the Balkans and Eastern Europe*,
Turkey **eats popcorn**,
Europe and USA manipulate African countries to maintain social control in order to own manage and extract natural resources Now China is becoming the major player,
154 Start of war When Ottoman went back from thoose lands peace broken,
western civilization has destroyed everything,
kurdistan **still dances around a fire**,
Plot twist the the Middle East is just another proxy war between Russia and the USA,
America is behind for everything and also Israel,
Im Iranian and I think its foolish to assume that revolution has happened  because Irans muslims felt stifled by the Shahs reformations But to be fair the rest is pretty much accurate,
Moral of the story *dont intervene with middle east politics*,
egypt is the only safe place in the middle east,
Two countries always seem to be involved US and Russia,
The middle east is getting more complicated maybe because its in the middle of the east,
The music made me tired thank you Vox,
What you said about Tunisia is wrong They were no intervention from Saudi Arabi or Iran to support the Sunni vs Shia confilct The revolution of Tunisia was not based on islamic conflicts or what so ever other reason related to the religion Its was a revolution against the government and the politilcal corruption of the country Its was a revolution for our freedom of speech and opinion,
A lot is missing russiaukTurkey with the trying to be the biggest power with help of obama gov,
Makes me wonder what would have happened had Bush not sent in troops in 2003 neither side wanted the US in there,
How are the Houthis an Iranian proxy group,
Everything bcz of oil thats it,
Poor Kuwait,
I cant help but notice the US involvement here,
To be clear Saudis only hate the Iranian leadership not the people,
I love this cold war tactics in Middle East even killing people is bad I will just have to imagine that its like a game,
I love kurdsh people from Ireland,
US did some one say oil,
And not a single word about the reign superpower israel,
GW Bush killed alot of young boys and girls We have no business in there holy wars,
Long live iran,
Where in all of this is Oman What is its role in past and present conflicts HFB,
The graphics team for Vox  Verge is amazing I cant imagine how long it takes to make these videos,
Once the fossil fuel resources in the Middle East is exhausted every rebel will succumb by itself,
No dad am invaded Saudi araibia hence the gulf war,
But Ottoman empire did not control the whole Saudi Arabia as you have shown,
023 *Three countries always seem to be involved Youre forgetting that the USA is heavily involved in the Middle Easts affairs no matter which country it is,
Immigrants also can include Eastern Europe Russia Western Europe also,
US foreign policyIsraelpentagonErik princeCIA Enough for destroy our world,
you forget 50 countries ar supporting Saudi Arabia in 2017,
Its rather misleading to say that the Ottoman Empire collapsed when it was in fact overthrown by Bedouin rebels supplied by the French and British under the promise of a future Arab stateonly to be divided up by European powers via the Treaty of Sevres Yeahits really odd to leave the invasion and genocide of Palestinians completely out of a discussion on the cold war of the Middle East in the 20th centurythats kind of a major facet of the breakup of that empire Proxy wars and oil are big factors here but this leaves it all like Europeans didnt start the mess off in the first place and somehow arent responsible for it Spoiler alert this was all caused by Europeans meddling in places where they were not wanted or invited then demanding the right to stay with force of arms,
I love how that CIA guy talks like the main reason isnt USA,
just for the your record guys Saddam Ayothaya and all the Iranian leaders king Fahad and the rest of AL SAuod leaders ARE DICTATORS,
IRAN The meaning of invading Iran is the beginning of the Third World War all major political analysts and war in the world,
Wahabi  Shia*,
Long live Jordan The most most peaceful country in the Middle East,
You didnt mentioned that the main supporter of Iraqs Saddam was us uk France and Soviet Union beside Saudi and they gave Saddam chamical weapons,
Any Q bout ksa im happy to answer I live there the media will never show u the truth,
The US destabilize the Middle East,
if everyone just minded their own business then we might just have peace,
Weird how somehow the US is always involved before during and after the war,
libya north africa thats how complex,
This is a pretty good and concise video but suffers under the makers indeed people in general tend toomit some important factors facts and information in order to project a particular standpoint So I will add a couple of points The first has been mentioned further down in this thread 1 Yes US powersthatbe not the general US population a great nation full of wonderful people strengthened Saddam as a bastion against Iran there are indications that certain US bodies CIA or whoever knew of the plan to or the likelihood toof the gas attack on the Kurds in Halabja which led to 710000 deaths and injured 2 The axis of the ignorant  US UK France etc states etc have messed around and messed up the middle east since oil was first discovered in the 19th Century and has directlyindirectly been jointly responsible not solely deaths and untold suffering of millions 3 The Shah of Iran was little more than a puppet of the US and others  and was a dictator who also brutally oppressed large parts of the Iranian population 4 anything else,
how many more lives does it take to tire the leaders out none until its dead,
And here Oman is like  we are not getting ourselves in this drama ,
I wish that my country wasnt involved in cold war,
USA and Iran Are One,
My Salute to Turkey for keeping its people safe amidst this Chaos,
wow actual factual nonbiased journalism almost forgot what it looked like,
I like how you casually ignore the fact that it was the USA that gave Iraq chemical weapons to use on Iran,
that was fantastically wellexplained ive watched a dozen of videos trying to explain the middle east conflicts and this is the best breakdown so far,
If perform well second grade or new citizen can become first grafe vitozen latet off course,
Note for everyone watching this video know that whenever Saudi is mentioned the US and Israel are playing complimentary major roles as well This video should focus more on that,
Wow Quite honest and thoughtful Honest integrity feels like fresh air Thank you for this work,
Its almost like a cold war inside another cold war,
This is so wrong you got almost everything wrong not that I was expecting anything good from vox anyways,
823 wtf are you talking about iran and saudi arabia have nothing to do with the revolution in tunisia I AM tunisian and i can tell you that it is all about social matters like poverty etc dont mention our revolution if you dont know what r u talking about,
can i get some book recommendations or other readings for a more detailed information,
The most complex geopolitical issue of our time narrated by a mouthbreathing brodude with the pronunciation of a midbender drunk GJ vox,
So US government made mess in other countries mainly Syria and IraqAnd then Europe has to take refugeesThats dumbCmon Trump even Canada and Russia took more refugees than us,
*US clear IraqSaddam*  Civil war and ISIS gain power *US clear Afganistan*  Al Qaida reborn and JeM in control under pakistan *US involved Vietnam civil war*  Collision between major parts,
AlQaeda ITS just conspiration,
Cyber war,
Can not we live in peace Reference to the worker In GLA in CQ GERENALS,
They dont teach you this in world history,
So basically the USA is the founder  funder and supporter of what it calls terrorism,
The background music is so good that it becomes a distraction at some point,
IRAN Very powerful and perfectly independent,
Oman is like the Switzerland of the Middle East no wars and so many mountains,
Kuwait is the Switzerland of all things tbh,
US certainly great again after this project,
Iran is not Islamic just pretended,
Jordan is just like hmm wanna share a cookie,
Without Turkey Perfect explanation,
Saudi Arabia has since been set free from the NWO control,
US has always been a snake,
Vox gets all of its information from the mainstream media government cheerleaders like CNN with complete loyalty and no questions asked,
cold war civil war world war but why no hot war,
Please keep in mind Vox is a FARLeft antiwest propaganda channel so everything you learn through this channel take with a fistful of salt,
Shah a little before revolution saidIf i go down Iran will go down If Iran goes down middle east will go down If middle east go down world will suffer on behalf of many many Iranians i say i wish islamic revolution never happened khomeini deceived people,
Please make a video on Pakistan  India relationship,
Jordan the land of peace,
I like how they minimize the impact of the USA and Russia These two countries and especially the USA are deeply involved in those conflicts You cant understand whats going on in middle est without understanding it,
I like the Iranian born Lebanese leader of the Movement of the Deprived Imam Musa Al Sadr It became the Amal Movement and the leader is Nabih Berri,
Neutral countries **sips soda**,
Its like the bloody us and soviet but in the middle east,
how can a youtube channel be better than school,
Can you make an updated version,
Whoever the US supports gets rich Whoever China or Russia supports remains poor,
So cold war on a regional scale vs a global scale,
Ok really good information But missing huge key elements about Israeli and US intervention too,
Is this why Shia Labeouf hates Sunni Labeouf so much,
Vox nice try then again your videos are for the gullible Give little truth and more nonsense Entice the public with some facts and then the western narrative of the world they shape,
DID SOMEBODY SAY OIL,
The US power way way outmatched the USSR which was only regional,
And theres a cold war in one of the hottest places in the world It should be called a hot war,
Funnily enough Mosaddegh wouldve likely made Iran into a secular democracy and prevented the revolution in 1979 Once again the USs reckless intervention turns a potential ally into a violent enemy,
US involves all bad,
IRAN VS SAUDI IN WW3,
253 The shah was a great man And he wasnt installed by the west,
Awsome analysis Impressive and eloquent narration of the rhetoric,
Just not going to talk about the US being involved in literally all of this,
Saudi good Iran bad what a surprise Vox,
*looks for a less biased video to explain things in a more objective way without drawing conclusions about who is the good and bad guy*,
the arabic spring isnt against monarchy it against Republic government,
Love Iran From India,
You forgot Israel,
They didnt bring up us or isreal or Europe,
Luv Iran luv frm Indian occupied Kashmir,
Indeed the United States is split really well between countries in order to sell its weapons to foolish states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE ,
Pakistan joins as spectator*,
Americas huge involvement in the region is mostly left out in the video but other than that its a good peice,
ROTHSCHILD CENTRAL BANKING SYSTEM  Centralization of money aka new world order lol Ilumanati lol,
Feud season 1 Bette and Joan Feud season 25 Saudi Arabia vs Iran,
i think safest place is out of universe,
USA Is always responsible for the terror in the world  after 911 they created Al Qaidah and then Daish and ISIS after Iraq war,
Fantastic work as usual Vox,
How do you call Syria Assad a Dictator when the Alwahabism 911 Kashaougi murderersfinancier is our is our Friend Oh what a world we live in and the Legacy for posterity,
The sunnishia split was never as violent They fought massive wars against each other assasinated each others leaders and attempted to exterminate each others civilian populations multiple times,
Hafez al Assad isnt a dictator Syria was great and strong under his control,
Islamic government and sharia law destroyed iran But the protests in the 20182017 were a bullet to the heart of the republic islamic,
Terrorism in Algeria  I dont think check your information again,
Is the narrator the same guy from Casually Explained,
IRAN Iran a great country with a few thousand years of civilization and with advanced military power and advanced technology in the 21st century fully selfsufficient and selfmade and with all power and power against all superpowers of the world including the largest superpower of the United States stand alone and stand alone,
Let me summarize USA started a war to sell weapon,
Its very funny that there is *NO MENTION of USA* interfere in each of these war,
It amazes me that no mention of Israel It bombs Syria daily and is very much involved in this Cold War why leave it out,
IRAN Iran is a very large country with seven thousand years of magnanimous civilization and history when all of these countries were the whole empire of Asia and even half of Europe,
U mean hot warright,
Did you guys even mention Israel in this video They play a huge factor in these proxy wars,
Is this still accurate,
Well the SunniShia split is certainly violent _now_,
There was always a conflict in this region oil makes people go crazy,
*Roll on the One World Government* it will get rid of all of these petty conflicts between countries once and for all and then there will be a selected breeding program going on,
Great video As a history buff I love the obscure stuff youre educating about in this video Nearly no one knows about the IranIraq War which was one of the deadliest since WW2 and the effects of the Great Game between Britain and Russia one of the most interesting rivalries preCold War Many props this is super informative and also really important for people to understand exactly why the Middle East is and has been such an area of conflict,
The rising why Saudi are loser they are taghuti my Allah bless the Shia,
700 the CIA claiming incompetency of the US is the oldest trick in the book Destabilizing the region to keep the weapons trade flowing while also bolstering the military intelligence industrial complex in the US as well,
Afghanistan will always be on Irans side Love from Afghanistan,
Cut The BS Saudis are just a face cover puppet to the USA and the Iran is Just another Puppet to it too that allowing its properties to be weapon test land just like Iraq in old days,
in between all these wars there is always United State of America,
America  if Iran is such a big problem then invade them wink wink and liberate the people Translation  Occupy extract oil for free in name of peace and stability,
They either got to be adults and move forward or have an actual battle let their be a winner and move forward Because the worlds getting tired of the constant turmoil in that region,
There has NEVER been peace in the middle east go look at newspapers from 100 years ago They dont want peace so there is none,
Thank god Saudi and Iran both are Allies of my country,
Just a little mistake  you included my country Morocco as one of the countries that suffers from the SaudiIran intervention and its on the bring of collapse  its absolutely not the case  we are a stable country who is very far away from the middle eastern turmoil,
Thank you i really enjoyed this a lot do more plz,
IFif my Grandmother had 4 rubber tires she would be an automobilehopefully 2019 Subaru,
And of course no mention of United States exploiting this cold war selling weapons to Saudi and constantly using veto power in the UN to impose sanctions on Iran,
How is nobody giving name to those Militias The ones backed by Saudi are Isis and Al Quaeda,
this video is full of historical inaccuracy typical vox,
dictators like Bashar Assad excuse me1 what the hell i think you meant Saudi Arabias corrupted king right,
At least they dont both have a shitton of nukes,
If only they become like the Ottoman Empire they would be stronger,
I love how Oman and the UAE dont interfer,
It is Ironic that you actually brought up a CIA Former Persian Gulf Military Analyst which basically means you brought a Westerner to Analyze the Middle East Which eventually Means exactly why America Failed grossly in the Middle East because typos like Kenneth Pollack are the people who give opinions worth a Fart because basically they see things from a different angles he doesnt speak the language never lived his entire life in the Communities there yet is preaching expertise about them And here is what we call Modern imperialism,
This is so informative wtf,
The largest Cold War is in fact the North pole and South Pole besides its cold they can never be joined together ever,
Sunni militia Dictator Assad Lol,
This is because of the US and their s Jewish leaders the top 1 of the 1 who control this world theyre experts are causing havoc,
turkey Citizens UAE Citizens and Kuwait citizens  *eats popcorn*,
now I understand why IRAN is number 1 of support of terrorism they started all this mess we need a war against IRAN IF THE WORLD NEED PEACE and ISIS will die,
It is more like America vs Russia Then puppets Saudi vs Iran Then smaller puppets Idiots vs idiots,
The cold war was actually 46 years 19451991,
Love iran from India,
Please make a similar video on the effects of the US pullout from Syria,
The video forgot Israel for sure also they forgot that Sunna  Shia has always been in war hundreds years ago before Saudi or Iran existed,
I think we all have an agreement on the big chaos USA did in Iraq Saddam Hussien was a dictator for sure but they took the leadership off the dictator and give it to extremist militias and ISIS is just a consequence I am very disappointed about the humanity in USA responds for this matter the US says that Iraqs invasion was a mistake and weve lost soldiers and troupes Ohh really just that well what about the country and lives youve ruined economically the country is completely destroyed the effects and results of the militias expanded and created the whole unstable situation in the Middle East as I said ISIS was a seed among the other militias the US watered and created the fertile environment for them to grow big and where is the payoff where is the aid for the troubles you did there when US speaks about the invasion and the American army their Patriotism is pushed to the boundaries of racism and beyond and they are completely ignorant for that But like we used to The US is like a baby who does the damage and cant be judged to fix it THANK you the GREAT USA were living in the shadows of your American dream for more than 13 years,
I almost died when I saw the map of the Ottoman Empire,
I MEANT TO B LEADER ONLY GOD KNOWS,
Most of the info are true but incredibly superficial and deceptive the real proxy war is between US Russia China and Israel It is told as if US never involved in Arab Spring and Syria Conflict All of a sudden out of nowhere people start to protest dictators and fight for democracy Then the saviors of democracy came and bring more destabilization violence and suffering,
As long as Oil exists there will be a need for US to pressure into selling it only in USD for their economy What better way to pressure than creating war using diversity and offering fake support Russia doesnt want US to grow and hence supports the opposite side,
US created ISIS simple,
How you think the Middle Easts Cold War happened Like Regional Dominance Comment USA,
Both Iran and Saudia tried to do the same in Pakistan but failed miserably,
Basically america and russia are the luminati overseeing tiny ants fight each other lol,
America Once oil runs out in the Middle East its Latin America time,
IRAN  All comments and more comments are in all other countries and they hate and hate Saudi Arabia and today the world has realized that Saudi is a valor of the United States and has been dying for the United States with his indignation in the world,
conclusion  were not human  we are the devil,
Arabia vs Persia Bring back Zoroastrianism to Persia,
Its crazy to think the World Cup is happening in Qatar I really hope it goes well for all the fans and football players,
The Middle Easts cold war explained in 2 letters US,
Well you forgot the basis of this entire problem the Sykes picot agreement,
Im from Scotland and if there were to ever be war between these two countries I will always side with Saudi Arabia,
Libya isnt apart of the Middle East ffs,
Iran is a piece of paradise on the planetIRAN,
Russia proxy Iran USA proxy Saudi,
I support those who follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him He is the only person we must follow,
Its all about that book Unless someone makes some serious modifications to the content of that book this will continue with or without USA or Israel,
IRAN All the Gul persin from Saudi Arabia with the UAE should be hiding behind the Americans but Iran alone stands alone in front of all of them,
I respect Aaga Khomeni he was right long live Iran,
653 Annnnd thats how isis was created,
Can anyone tell me how Italy is related to all this Its for a research I am doing,
IRAN Its time for the great empire of Iran like the old ones to rise from the beginning and from the beginning and it will continue to exist which will happen or it will happen soon,
128 you forgot Greece,
IRAN All the Gulf PERSIN from Saudi Arabia with the UAE should be hiding behind the Americans but Iran alone stands alone in front of all of them,
Bush good ole boy bush BUSH in his wisdom disbanded the army of Iraq why So now the army personnel joined militias etc,
I love and support Iran Saudi Arabia your time is end now,
The Middle East is quite small and if they continue to send oil cheaper than they ever did whats the problem There are the same forest fires all around the globeLOL He wrote ironically,
Some key roles are missing But not bad anyway Just sneaky and hiding some truths from dummies who believe everything they see because they dont bother reading,
Presentation wise you make great videos but i am starting to see a pattern of incomplete research by excluding Israel in almost every video I want an unbiased authentic source I havent found one anywhere Even Vox has drawn out some lines,
as an Egyptian Muslim watching many YouTube channels and reading many western articles i have so much respect for VOX because they have proved to be really honest when delivering any news related to the middleeast on the opposite most of the other news outlets in the us and Europe dont get it and just tell you what you want to hear and deliver pure bullshit SO thanks you everyone at Vox working on these videos for you great work,
Americans are the biggest oil stealer,
US needs to look at its true values not just fund countries who are involved in hurting civilians,
But did Iraq invate the whole iran,
Your idea about how Saudi Arabia was formed is incredible over simplistic and wrong,
America would now be eating popcorn if they didnt drank those oil,
Libya is not in the Middle East though,
 The USA and Israel are still backing the Saudis and their proxy wars this cold war is turning into USA vs Russia,
Saudi Arabia n there cousins Israels time is coming n hopefully soon,
This videp is heavily downplaying the impact of the US politics in that region The USA caused most of these conflicts between 1953 and 2001 to gain rights for their oil companies and while doing so made the states buy their weapons sometimes using israel as a middle man,
Long live Iran and Iran live long Iran and Iran a great country with an old civilization with strong and lively hearts and with all the power and military strength and high technology and people,
The USA should have ended it in 1979,
You know what these middle eastern countries remind me of They remind me of Europe back in the early 1900s,
American and urope and Studies helped iraq in IRAN iraq war,
The USs policy has been to prevent countries to develop and become economically and politically independent for years We need to understand the hidden incentives of these wars otherwise we wont be able to judge neutrally Wars get begun by someone and their equipments and funds the rest is a drama of misery and desolation,
Iran is middle Easts superpower,
Theran is the strongest nation on middle east i see x,
Sunni Shia split was never as violent Ummm,
And Israel  USA has nothing to do with all of this ,
2019 boys it kinda feels better,
Imagine getting news from vox,
Basically the BritishFrenchUSA and Soviets fby fighting for their influence they make it all a mess,
Lebanon was not part of the 2011 Arab spring It has always been a republic relying on a Democracy,
The only Middle East issue is the American attempts to influence and control oil supply,
I wish I could watch you but you are fake news,
Iraq is the aggressor and attacker against Iran during the 1980s IranIraq War,
Let me stop you right there and correct you both sunni and Shia are fighting together side by side against isis in Syria so go saying we are fighting each other I know this is late but worth it,
Cold war kind of an ironic name,
Sunni rebel groups in syria are in fact ISIS formed by mostly NON SYRIAN fighters,
typically they never say that saddam was also brought to power by the usa just like the shah,
and the us got many profitable purposes making a chaos is us hobbie,
That is Not The Picture of Reza Shah That is The Picture of His Sun Mohammad Reza,
This video has so many errors that I even dont know where to start But worth to notice Iran is a civilized country with high education rates while Saudi Arabia is a terror supporting country with high illiterate rates and with a high procentige of child abuse which at the moment are bombing the living crap out of majority civilians in Yemen which have been tired of having a Saudi puppet as their president Talk about Us Saudi propaganda video trying to seem serious butat the same time constantly sneaking in false and distorted facts,
USA people are the swine breed Root cause of every single problem Hoping to see the demise of that country,
Its not about saudi or Iran everything has got to do to us,
Long live IRAN,
when you dont mention israel,
This guys blind America Britain always involved Whos supplying weapons,
You got a lot wrong ive lived there,
Change this Iraqi governments who are Iran friendly Give power to the Iraqis and they will stabilize the whole region in less than a year Just like how it was under Saddam Hussein,
539 to 635,
The sanctions that the worlds nations impose on Iran would fail if it were for another country but we are strong One day you will be punished,
this is oil war  not cold war ,
CIA misleading commentary,
132 you call Viet Cong rebels Are you sure  From Vietnam,
Yahood Arabia,
Anyone notice how according to them Hezbollah is an extremist group but isil isnt Yeah because ISIL doesnt hate israel while Hezbollah does,
The 4 collapsing countries in the Middle East are Libya Syria Iraq and Yemen Wait didnt the US invade all of these countries and overthrow their governments Hmm I wonder why these countries are failing,
WONG,
the us always wants to get involved,
wow are they missing a lot of info in this VIDEO,
what is that suspenseful music in the background can someone tell me the name thanks,
So what on earth gives the US the authority to invade a country that easily ,
But between all those powerful people innocent civilians are suffering for no reason,
who else is still confused,
Pray for the innocent children and families in Syria,
US training rebels why is it so familiar Ohh AlQaida ISIS right,
I swear if US and Russia doesnt intervene in others matters The world would be a better place to live,
I think if we just gave Assad a Pepsi wed all be friends again,
you think the Syrian civil war was bad look at the comment section,
This is much difficult than to comprehend World War 2,
2020 *North Korea bombs whole Syria ending the civil war*,
Im Syrian and I hope Syrians are safe,
This is a match between Usa vs Russia Ksa vs Iran Rebels vs Asad Isis vs Kurds and all others And the stadium is Syria So what we wait is the result,
I never trusted the US I have already seen what other Western medias trying to cover up about my country I believe the United States are doing the same thing to the Middle East as they have already done to my nation  Btw the EDITING of VOX is PURELY EXTRAORDINARY But the accuracy may be wrong Also I hate CIA,
This comment section is loaded with conspiracy theorists and propaganda It is hard to follow,
In spite of being in such an oil rich region all they can do is fight amongst each other See even their battles are so complicated nobody knows who is fighting with whom and for what,
Also if you really want to know what caused chaos in the Middle East its WW1 when the Ottoman Empire fell It was broken into regions to be overseen by the allied powers and the crippled economies of the allied nations meant they didnt have the money or time to really try to establish nations The UK was in charge of Iraq and France was I charge or Syria Yall might want to actually learn about history if youre going to discuss it,
Vox is such an Israeli backed channel They never mention the founder and patrons of ISIS,
Simple facts  1 Asad and his father Hafez terrorized Syria for decades through their dictatorship 2 The beginning of the story was a simple demand for rights and corrective actions but Asad handled it with brutal force  3 The Asad government basically collapsed after 6 months of conflict but Iran interfered to save it  4 As the time basis it became a cirques for world powers to show their muscles in syrian ground  5 The poor syrians left their country immigrating to Jordan  turkey  germany etc  6 As usual whenever US steps to solve a conflict they end up making it worse ,
Someone once told me why doesnt Isis fight against Israel Because a dog doesnt bite its own tail,
In less words  Russia and US are playing Dominos in Syria,
pathetic syria i feel bad fr syria pplallah give thm jannah,
So Im the gulf states And Im half Moroccan and Saudi I feel bad for Syria ,
It totally fault of ASSAD backed by pigs of Iran,
Yeah funny thing Saudi Arabia has also commited atrocities aswell as used poison gas in Yemen,
Why did you attacked Iraq  Usa We think they have chemical weapons Why did you attacked Syria Usa We think they have chemical weapons Why dont you attack North Korea Usa Are you crazy  We know they have chemical weapons ,
To solve this problem is easy remove all mentioned map from earth,
No mention of alQaeda in Idlib and Israels involvement Shoddy work my friends,
to be honest somethings are wrong in this vid im syrian and i know wtf is going on in my country,
510 Russia joins the chat  * Cyka Blyat everywhere,
I feel so bad for all the citizens who are struggling through all of these problems,
They may as well have just sent all of the gangbangers off the streets of Chicago over there into the mix Hopefully may be a little enlightening to the lads yeah and there were already enough factions in that war that one more added in for good measure wouldnt have made that much difference to the situation over there anyhow,
Im a Syrian and this Video said the Truth,
Ups did i do that USA,
Bring them all to Canada,
Its so easy to get caught up in the politics and then forget this is many peoples day to day reality living in this war zone that has destroyed their life and country Breaks my heart,
When will human learn to stop fighting each other Syria government EXTREME STUPID,
018 Man these doritos are spicy,
Watch this video if you enjoy American propaganda Its been proven that the chemical attack in Syria was staged It was a fake video,
untrue Im in Syria,
100 years ago yesterday the us joined ww1 no joke,
This one Civil war America needs to stay out of too many different factions fighting to be involved in such a conflict,
Did you hear of the Female journalist proved Assad had nothing to do with the 2013 chemical attack and she just happen to Die Lol you figure it out,
This is even more complicated than Brexit,
OIL and GAZ need show control map,
Thanks god China didnt get into this mess,
Im 13 years old and want to learn,
this gave me goosebumps,
Total warSyria,
Its official The End is Near,
This sounds too much like the start of World War 1,
Dost m zarazilo e Rusko je proti USA Myslel sem e sou spojenci,
Assad did not use chemical weapons Russians did bomb ISIL,
Hillary Clinton we made and trained isis Trump We spent more than 7000000000000 in Syria Iran spent 16000000 in middle east Arab nations didnt calculate how much they spent but quite more than USA Iran We spent only 2800000 in Syria now see this page who wins httpsenwikipediaorgwikiIslamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_LevantmediaFileSyrian_Iraqi_and_Lebanese_insurgenciespng note Isis and rebels are actually supported by us there are many videos and documents that shows that they are helping Isis and rebelsHistory says that USA is a liar Russia says we have documents that show Assad didnt use chemical weapons so judge it carefully ,
But what is the real reason the US were intervening I guess its more about oil and the weapon industry than about social engagement,
Now its time for my favorite part of a video like this Reading all the comments from people who apparently know just what to do in this situation It doesnt matter how complicated the issue how many parties are involved how deadly the result would be if it didnt work out Youtube commenters are the only ones who know what to do Either that or the debates devolve into mud slinging and insult throwing while the issue is completely ignored in the name of petty ego fights and trolling,
But what is the real reason the US were intervening I guess its more about oil and the weapon industry than about social engagement,
Make a video on the Lebanese Civil War,
103 Most of the protesters dont know how to use guns Only the military does,
At least isis is gone now,
Just a reminder Trump heavily criticized President Obama for trying to intervene,
Then i thought marawi war in my country ph was bad This is worst I gave yall all my prayers stop them wars,
Is is war world 3 in Syria every nation is flexing their muscles there sad reality,
This is one of those wars where its so confusing there is proably just fighting for fighting,
Trump should have fired pepsi cans instead of missiles,
USA dosent like that Russia protects syria because US marines are actually making mistakes,
Hey Isnt isis gone now Or is this video old Oh it is,
i was lost by the time they said unclear and confusing at 500,
Thank you so much for this This helped to simplify everything and clear up my questions Much appreciated,
Cool video im gonna go for a run then go to the gym might as well get in shape before im drafted to go fight in ww3,
Syria was heaven on earth but now I will do everything,
If USA AND RUSSIA dont fix this problem fast  bad shits gonna happen,
I heard the syrian people loved assad the winner makes the history Hard to know which one to believe,
Yes true Rusiya and america playing syriya,
The only losers here are those innocent people caught in the conflict,
2 cold war USA vs Russia and Iran vs Saudi Arabia and some other countries fight for her side and Syria is battlefield,
No Peace Found in Middle East some sort of curse a very very long time ago,
its like Assad  wanna fight me Rebels  yeah ISIS  sup wanna fight Rebels  oh God what we gonna do now,
Usa bring chemical weapons to syria  iran IRGC forces recently said  usa warchip useing for trasfert of chemical weapon recently came to middle east,
This war is such a shame Really shows humanity hasnt gotten that far definitely not as far as we think Proxy wars human rights abuse and a game of selling arms for money Shame on us all,
Trump Isis is defeated 2019 4 troops killed 1 injured 2019 bomb philphiens both two have been claimed by isis,
Say this to your friend and tell them to spread the word we need to help  Love not hate Dont say silent ,
JUST PLANNED PROXY WAR A huge mess,
This video is almost half correct,
you forgot a main underground player israel,
Dropping a few chemical bombs was enough to bring america in to this chaos,
Lets you and him fight,
Assad never used chemical weapons  thats utter BS,
Its a giant GOAT SCREW smdh,
Saudi the reason of crisis everywhere,
Hezbollah and Assad are the only heroes of this war Theyre the only side that represent unity between arabs in the region and the forces of Assad and Hezbollah are the only ones apart from the kurds whove defended christians from Daesh,
When the rich wage war its the poor who die  JeanPaul Satre,
just training for WW3,
the world need peace Kendall jenner is the only one can solve this kind of problm kendall dont forget to bring a can of pepsi haha,
Bashar Al Asad belongs to baathism ideology Sadan Hussein also belonged to same baathist ideology party,
Abd cause chaos everywhere,
The chaos in Syria was the main reason ISIS got this powerful  Tons of resources was left in Syria for them after the government retreat especially east of the country,
217 and Iraq is taking most of the damage GREAT,
God save those Inocent peoples living in Syria,
Why is Europe and the US even butting in a middle East conflict,
explained very well thanks MAGA,
USA and Gulf countries are responsible for the killing of Syrian innocents,
447 its wrong Turkey bomb both them all isis and radical communists,
Zaheer we are going back to the natural order Korra shouldve not stopped zaheer now isis keeps attacking,
In a dark day a young man took a brand new knife and killed a moderate opposition The incident was seen by the blind man and the blind man heard it and the blind man quickly ran to the United States to report the case,
Poor innocent people My heart is broken,
And now US forces are leaving Syria,
what does Syria have that all these outside governments want,
Excellent very interesting video Thanks,
Israel also they wanna run a pipeline through Syria they USA,
Those who destroyed Syria and killed thousands are The regime forces Russia Iran The Islamic state The Nusra front The Kurds Without these the Syrian revolution would have won since 2013,
There is a girl in my school and she is from Syria She told me loads about what people are going through in Syria Its dangerous We our so lucky to have her in my schooland shes Learning a lot of English and shes working soo hard,
Assad  ISIS  kurdish  rebels turkey  gulf states  IRAN  USA  Russia everyone is fighting and who is dying  Innocent ctizens ,
hizbollah and iran are the protectors of the middle east labaik ya nasr allah,
You forgot Israel the main source of funds of the war You didnt mention anything about the war that the media played It was worse than the real war By the way Im Syrian And most of the video is not accurate 310,
its bad game of sim,
My professor in school told us the class that Syrian war started beacuse of Croatia Some Croatians from oil industry Ina made a deal with Syria that if they find oil in their country they will split it 5050 and when they found it great powers came there to fight for control over the oil in Syria,
Why isnt Israeli role not mentioned Why isnt Turkeys support to ISIS by buying their oil and funding them to kill Kurds not mentioned,
No russian bots D,
There has been no proof Syria and Assad used the weapons,
But why did it start what made the peaceful protests occur,
Im a Syrian and I agree with this video I dont like or agree with assadisisthe rebelsKurdish or TurkishI just want my country back ,
And also ANOTHER MESS CREATED BY USofA geeez,
I want them to support the kurds  Seem like a better bunch,
Perfect example how politics work,
war is making this world look a lot like hell,
Assad didnt use chemical weapons only propaganda Just like in Vietnam Iraq Serbia Libya and now Sirya USA will fall and then world will be free Every president who dont want to listen and follow the orders from USA,
hey so where are those chemical weapons syria used ooh goddamn it you got fooled again gee looks like we are having a pattern here,
The other countries should not have got involved then maybe so many people wouldnt have died allah help us all,
I am Syrian Assad protects the people,
whereas me  I am fighting for room with my sister,
*FREE PALESTINE* whats the name of that piano song 315 btw,
2012 2013 I was attacked while I worked chemical agent used Damaged me I caught them then have been attacked again to cover up,
Thanks heaps for sharing 3,
What chemical weapons,
Can anyone share the background score Loved it,
250 thats a lie syria never used those chemical bombs USA said that just to take all their oil and act like they deserved it,
Feels pity for the civilians stuck between this political mess,
there is no cure for nationalism or fanatism As long people will worship flags we will forget that we all humans living on the same planet We need to stop national pride This will stop wars,
As much as I hate bashar alAssad what happens when he is out of power who is going to rule Syria its going to be another Libya,
Wait the CIA and Pentagon trained the rebels which a small faction eventually became ISIS Jesus thats crazy And part of the rebels who they still support through arms sales are Jabhat alNusra which literally is Al Qaeda and Taliban Someone tell that isent true Is this a choice of lesser evils between the RussiansIran I find this difficult,
the newclear world war will start from syria its end the world,
peaceful Arab spring demonstrations LMAO,
Old men give commands while the young ones die following orders Youll never see them grabbing a gun and go into wars so its a shame seeing the youth do it for them,
Imagine if WW3 did start like tommorow how would you feel,
everytime US steps in for sure there will be carnage,
USA fighting Russia indirectly  Arabs fighting Iran indirectly Other less quality of terrorists trying their weapons  And the battlefield is Always thousands of childrens lives ,
Why dont you mention anything about Israel or war crimes committed by rebels,
Relationship statusVery Complicated,
Why not mention Iran fights ISIS daily cant ruin the image that Iran is the axis of devil,
This video helped me so much thank you *thumbs up*,
Can you do an update video Its been too long,
Have you ever faced a problem you can go in but cannot go out,
Welp Cyprus is watching,
Where is the UN in all of this,
Long live the mujahideen taliban,
i think this is the most complicated war in history i have never seen a war with 4 opposing sides that is founded by multiple sources and fight multiple proxy wars against each others,
Wow Vox Have you been lying like this all these years,
Total war Syria,
The last time CIA trained rebels in Afghanistan Taliban was born So much for installing a democracy,
By peaceful arab spring demonstrators Yeah they sure looked peaceful Them and the Mossad hit squad who fired the first shots,
By telling the TRUTH we can HELP the people of Syria In the comment sections to our friends May those warmongers which pushed for war on CNN personally witness the dead children,
One of the finest and simplest explainations on the web There is still lot to talk about but for 645 thats the best you can get,
Im Syrian and we love Al Assad so plz US  any other country leave us alone,
You have to go back to 1943 if youre going to give the history of conflict in Syria,
Send Canadians North Koreans WITH COUNTLESS NUKES and India So they can help Syria end the war easily,
We say RIP Syria  but we will Rut in dirt unfortunately who would cry on the Arabs on our great nation after we die  NO ONE  We only have ourselves So stop the war fight your enemies not your people  i miss those old Arabian days,
Im Living in Lebanon next to Syria  everything is Cool here,
Why cant Assad be nice to his people,
If Syria was the part of turkey or ottomans there would be no war Peace can be happening in this state,
I was born in Syria and thankfully im in aus now thank you god,
Its all about Oil and wealth my friend its all about that Trump needs Oil for his space fleet Its real they have space ships,
WE ARE ONE,
Anyone here before we go to world war 3,
so much disinformation and propaganda hereits disgusting ugh,
isis is gone in 2020 ,
Remarkable that Israel is not mentioned by Vox,
THE US GOVERNMENT NEVER USESD CHIMCAL WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WINNING THE WAR,
Do another of these videos to explain the current situation,
Saudi Arabia and US also supporting Kurds,
Its funny how the second chem attack from Assad came so shortly after Trump said the US was pulling out of Syria *cough Israel cough cough,
Wish we the people of the world can control our destiny somehow with communication using the internet,
Im from Iran and every week we have some dead bodies from Syria I dont know when we have peace in MiddleEast When we listen and speak instead of killing each other Syria became like a game for big powers they all want to win in this game and show theyre power but they just destroyed Syria If war stopped right now its take at least 25 years to rebuild this country As Iranian Im feeling so guilty about this stupid war I know that 5M Syrian refugees will hate iran maybe not today but in future that hate come back to us We Middle Eastern people have same culture same food same history we build civilization here we conquered the world but when we are united While all of the word are growing we are just fighting each other and buy weapons Its dream of mine that someday there is no war in Middle East _,
i remembered assad said before the civil warif syria fall so europe n the rest of the world will perised,
This video is so amazing I love how you guys add the music to the video and I love your animation styles What do you guys use to make these videos,
This video is biased In short all this can explained as US wanting regime change in Syria and wants same for Syria as Libya and Iraq,
Is this channel sponsored by cnn,
Turkey supports Free Syrian Army against Assad and ISIS Turkey launched operation Euphrates shield against ISIS Vid Turkey aint doing nothing against ISIS,
Its so hard to know whats going on it is so complicated and virtually everybody lies to push their own agenda and beliefs,
*INDIAS MAP IS SHOWN WRONG*,
Who US and Russia Why Oil Done,
Where do you get the facts that Assad used those chemical weapons on civilians,
You have no right to blame the Syrian government for the chemical attack when there was no clear evidence The UN even investigated and failed to find any connections to Assad,
This will fix the problem ww3 NukesNon Stop War,
There is no provethat Syria army usedchimical weapon,
Syria became a platform to play game for world and poor people dying and suffering ,
They got the best photo of trump,
And Lebanon stuck between two countries that have war in them lol,
In the end its about resources oil mostly,
It cant stop And thats what the world has done to middle east,
Soon Vox would post How WW3 started and why,
Vox comment war Who is fighting and why,
I love cereal  glad we pulling out,
whos fighting whom again Lol,
Assad use of chemical weapons has not been proven,
US is only funding rebels who will fight ISIS and not goverment thats pretty convincing sarcasm,
War in Syria,
No USA wants the war to keep on going so they can sneak and steal oil,
War in the middleshit will NEVER stop As soon as one war is ended you can be sure that another war is on the making,
even by mistake you should have mentioned a truth all information in the video was lie lie lie,
I coulda sworn we were going to war with Iraq,
Tons of weapons thousand of plants millions of workers will be run out of money  inside problems many technologies need push  graft  lazy economy  tons of old weapons  old soviet Union dream  Question  what is the solution  Answer  free huge pie for everyone  Question  where we can find it  Answer  medil of East ,
Good explained But so complicated that istill understand nothin,
Who Amerika se bori za nafto,
And why did you hide Israel in 012 ,
It is a never ending conflict,
SAA just accused of chemical attack we dont know do they used or not,
Thank you America for arming ISIS We really apreciate it 333,
Americs is root of all evil,
Every war is a rich mans trick Unkown,
So basically Syria is a chaotic battleground where each sides fighting each other,
Stop the guns lets fight on the ring no weapons,
I came to see the comments from crazy nationalists,
It says when you are internally weak outsiders take advantage of you,
I feel really bad for the innocent Normal people there Removed if there are any part,
And who is guetting all the immegrees  LEBANON  Im russian lebaneese so I obviously hate the rebels  I dont love the other sides as well because Im christian ,
551 oh God no more,
As every time a lot of nonobjective informations in your report,
How on earth you managed to explain Syrian war without illigal Isreal Lol,
Only innocent souls are dying Screw these leaders,
You should do a updated video on this cause its a year later now and lots of things have happened,
Cause USA and Russia Plays again with other Lifes,
Alot has happened since would like a part 2,
Every time SAA wins a major victory chemical weapons are deployed and used Think about it,
Why is Israel not mentioned AND Why is who funded ISIS not mentioned Think for yourself The truth is out there,
Its alwayZz been a huge tug of war differences and jealousy loads of malicious people and stubborn hatered that could never be eradicated they alwayZz hated us,
Syrian government Syrian rebels  ISIS Khurdz USA Russia Turkey Saudi Iraq and finally You and Me all dont know whats going on,
Why it is saying gulf states  We all know it is Saudi Arabia ,
Inshaallah after complete my course Im comming to fight for seriya InshaAllah I will get this opportunity to help these innocent people,
1 year has passed and today another strike by US UK and France Its just a mere playground for world powers to try their weapons and kill innocent children in the name of gas or anything ,
The rebels are actually Isis funded by USA and Turkey to overthrow Assad and the Syrian government but it didnt work D btw Vox your channel is full of misleading content including this video and Im disliking it,
All lies God bless Syria,
Syrian govt killing their own people omg,
I feel lucky that Im not living in this kinda country proud to be an Indian and my PM an Military whos protecting us,
Usa world domination tour Bombing a country near you,
Wonderful rendering What program did you use,
Russia ask To be there to help Syria to fight fsa and Isis US to there in Syria to invade and take oil field and arms the Isis,
i mustve missed it but why does everyone want Syria,
So basically there are USA Russia Terrorists And idk what kurds do,
Greetings from Syria,
Jesus this is more complicated than the Cold War,
I am curious why Assad uses chemical weapons If he stops that the US will likely gag down an Assad regime This is actually a real opportunity to work WITH the Russians,
This is just the usa version,
Assad Regime has won,
118 What a smart move,
Assad encourages jihadists to join rebels to make it harder to support them That moment when you went too far portraying Assad as an evil master The moment you start bullshitting,
Sometimes you just got to throw the whole country away and reform the Ottoman Empire,
Assad is the lesser evil of all choices Most of the gulf states have monarchs anyway and they are stable Removing monarchs by force can result in a country that is not prepared to handle democracy Best examples are Iraq and Libya Removing their leaders has destabilized the entire region produced countless terrorist groups and militia people smuggling and refugee crisis etc etc Just leave countries alone and they can sort themselves out,
However this could be a sign of the day of judgement the ones who r fighting dont know they r killing,
The rebels used chemical weapons against civilians to be at the head of the Syrian government with the help of US dogs,
and look at the west see cyprus i live in that innocent country,
better you clear your concept,
0548 Chemical Weapons Pack of Doritos I always knew those things were dangerous,
i thought america and israel are in isis side lol,
middle east is a big wepons test,
I may be opposing akp but bombing kurds that attacking our borders right thing do or they will kill us even tried to see the war by eyes of turkey ,
Turns out the temples dochange people to an extent,
It is always for the money that wars are fought,
just nuke syria and war ganna end,
Kurdish forces,
basically a fire started and every nation in the region and conflicting power in the world started flying over and dumping fuel into the fire,
This video needs and update,
Yeah yeah yeah Assad was winning and then he used the chemical weapons Yeah yeah yeah this is so logical Good job America,
tldr assad did something which had an egregious warmonger penalty and everyone denounced him,
It becomes obvious that you have no idea about who is funding the terrotist groups and what the agenda is You need to stop tahong your informstiob from Zionist owned media sources To educate you wiuld take a few hundred hours of lectures,
Alexa this is so sad play despacito number 885 feat Dj isis Sad remix,
Im a Kurd Im a young girl which lives in England but Im in kurdistain at the moment and Im safe I guess theres no fighting round me,
This is exactly how the First World War started a small dispute in the east back up by more powerful nations Its scary to think we could be heading toward another world war,
Humans can be more worse than animals Hence proved,
Chemical weapons are used to prepare large provocations in SyriaThe information came from the people of the province of IdlibThere are plans to infect ammunition from the rocket launchers in the KaferZait settlement six kilometers south of Habit with toxic substances over the next two days,
Vox Or very ordinary xtreme propaganda Neatly folding together a one sided display of the widely accepted cover story Omiting all the contradictions,
055 How did they get guns It doesnt make any sense,
Who would gas his own people for trouble absurd,
war is about killing killing for what whatevil,
A proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran And Russia and America,
Its all starts with peaceful protests,
Sorry i am not convinced of neither USA or Russias reason to join the war I dont buy the humanitarian reasons,
It USA fault not someone else should pay only USA and it friend I see I wait and I enjoy,
They control peoplethey keep people at warall the timeI just hope they perish in burning Lava,
So if Assad were to dismantle his alliance with Russia and Iran would US government still care about the civil war,
of course oil hunter syria just like training battle field for usrussia,
You cant ally with any of them None of these regimes want peace,
Its always funny how people are like Russia would destroy the US The US wouldnt stand up against Syria or Russia *US launches tomahawk missiles into Syrian air Base* The balls in your court Russia,
So complicated May God helps civilians who are they the real victims from Politics crime,
2017,
vox is really great ,
Are you confused about what is going on in the Middle East Allow me to explain from a USUK perspective We The West support the Iraqi government in their fight against ISIS We dont like ISIS but ISIS is supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar whom we do like because we love our oil nice and cheap The Iraqi government is getting help from Iran to fight ISIS but we dont like Iran because they dont like listening to us Now coming to Syria We dont like Syrian President Bashar Al Assad whos a big baddie because he is friends with other big baddies like Russia and Iran So we support the fight against Assad by arming training and funding moderate rebels because overthrowing Assad means we can put a goodie ie someone who will listen to us in his place So we do not cooperate with the baddies Assad Iran and Russia who btw are also at war with ISIS to collectively defeat ISIS even though defeating ISIS is supposedly our number one priority in ME because the baddies are also attacking our moderate rebels without whom our regime change plan would fail So some of our friends are supporting some of our enemies and some of our enemies are kind of like our friends cos theyre fighting against our other enemies whom we want to lose but we also dont want our enemies who are fighting our other enemies to win because theyre also our enemies So right now we dont know which one of our enemies we want for to win and which one of them we want for to loseand while we make up our minds the war rages on for which all parties need more and more weapons to continue waging and since we are the biggest weapons exporter in the world more warmore money so I guess perpetual warfare is just what the doctor ordered And lets not forget this whole mess started in the first place by our ILLEGALLY invading a country in search of WMDs that NEVER existed to drive out terrorists who only cropped up AFTER we went in to drive them out Do you understand now,
Talking about kurds there no actually evidence about their nation its make up by england in ww1,
Error 404 Objectiveness not found,
I swear to god if uk joins this this might be a world war,
Remember when 25 of youtube was just lego animations,
Im born in a year 2000 When YouTube was created in a year 2005 I didnt pay that much attention to it But I remember when my big brother showed me a Lego stop motion somewhere between years 2006 and 2007 I do not remember correctly It was one of those typical Lego stop motions which had 009 Sound System music and blue screen with white text in the beginning The animation was pretty rough and maybe 8 FPS To think about that video today there is NOTHING so nostalgic than that memory Since those years I had always wanted to do Lego stop motions myself Then in a year 2011 I created my channel and I have since then done Lego stop motion animations Its something that Id never want to quit,
Does anyone remember The lego clutch powers movie No *lip smacks* Crap,
1989 Magic Portal 2019 *LEgO FoRTNiTe*,
Im so happy that they made it look like a stop motion instead of a generic animated movie,
249 Roblox in development,
I love this video It encompasses and explains the history and process of Lego animations over the last 15 years As a Lego fan who grew up seeing the animation in movies and video games evolve and change I truly appreciate it Thanks so much,
I watched this with my Mom way back from 2014 she had Cancer thankfully now she recovered Thank god,
I absolutely love it when big groups  companies are inspired by fans and do things together with them Its such a delight,
Hey they showed my thing cool,
i liked that this video referenced the first BIONICLE movie,
And now the Lego movie 2 is out,
Its the best of the two worlds Stop Motion with CGI enhancements,
everything made out of lego in the lego movie 217 THE BLANKET,
who else remembers watching lego stopmotion films on youtube in like 2006,
Only 90s kids remember forrestfire101 edit also early 2000s kids as well thank you Alexandra,
Who remembers forest fire s lego batman series,
Lego is boring to my friend and he LEt it GO Get it No only me Ok,
when i was like seven all my mum had on her computer was lego digital designer i loved it i had all the lego i wanted and could clean it up with the press of a button,
I hope Lego have sent an apology letter to Lindsay Fleay since Id love to hear what he thinks of the easter egg for his film in The Lego Movie,
I dont know why but ut seems like a lot of Americans think Lego is American It seems like no one knows that its actually danish,
Captain America vs Zombies vs Winter Soldier My favorite lego short film,
Anakin is so scary 125,
LDD  LDraw  Blender  LEGO Movie,
The lego movie is one of those films that is way better than it has any right to be,
Theyre finally doing recycled LEGOs,
 _Free software_  This movie was very low budget but had great quality,
Brick Films Halo was the best one by far on youtube,
This is 2014 Yes thats me 024,
Wow The Lego Movie is genius,
This is 2014 Emmet Thats me,
I remember growing up watching LEGO Stopmotions on YouTube,
theres a 2019 film called the lego movie 2,
Whats the song at 002,
Great video but you should include Lego Sport Champions animated videos from 1987,
I love how vox concludes their videos it just brings all the ideas and a sense of emotion down to you,
And now theres a second one yayyyyy Chris Pratt,
Okay YouTube I watched it can you please leave me alone now,
forrestfire101 tho,
It took 5 years to make the second LEGO movie with so much detailed LEGO Even made scratches dents and other stuff on the minifigures Took 14 years to make the incredibles 2,
Killroy was here,
Megablocks still a thing Anyone,
Slightly horrifying 124,
It must have taken forever to make the lego movie,
Everything is made of Lego Except the blanket on his bed,
its impressive how its actually cgi looks real tbh,
I LOVE THIE MAGIC PORTAL D,
I have a custom Lego figure And hername is Lieutenant twinkling spoon,
The LEGO movie was probably the most nostalgic movie I have ever watched and this was exactly the reason They captured the feeling me and my friends had playing and sometimes filming with LEGO when we were young This was my childhood,
A good Vox documentary,
2001JackStone 2014 the lego movie 2019 the lego movie 2,
000  031 What is the Song,
I feel like Bionicle could get away with that kind of animation I still own Mask of Light on vhs and I think it aged alright xD,
All of a sudden I really want to watch the lego movie for some reason,
Now there is a second LEGO movie Wow,
It all started at the Lego beer song for me,
that is so interesting 400 perhaps you should do history of lego home movies,
What is the name of the first song,
_heyy thats pretty good_,
I didnt know they used LEGO digital designer for concepts,
Its 2019 but yet this still blows my mind  this is one of the reasons I wanna be an Engineer,
I know this is an old video but now theres a different free program called Studio for making lego models it even has photo realistic rendering,
Who remembers The Adventures of Clutch Powers,
Ahh the old school brick filmingBrick films changed a lot since those days,
the lego movie is the most beautiful piece of trash ever,
And Lego Batman movie Lego ninjago movie Lego movie 2,
I came back to watch this video and started feeling really bad for Fleay So Fleay if youre out there good job,
keep on doing non political stuff this was great,
I suddenly got flashbacks to all of the LEGO movies I watched around 20082009,
Theres a huge difference in 2001 and 2014 and heres how they made it happen TECHNOLOGY GOT BETTER,
Im going to remake 2001 a space odessy in lego stop motion shot for shot,
This is very good explanation good job EDITsorry for my bad English,
Holy crap I watched Jack Stone and Bionicle as a kid Completely forgot about them throwback,
lego movie 2 anyone ,
Wow I remember seeing The Magic Portal on SBS in about 1990 Its a classic,
I have the jack stone lego figure,
I remember making stop motion lego films when I was young But I did like that style of the lego movie it was fun and playful and reminded me of imagining creating the most oddball and random contraptions with the toys,
The Lego movie from 2014 rocked,
its so amazing that I was able watched the magic portal years before the lego movie was announced looking at the magic portal video just makes me feel so nostalgic,
Its means all the lego movies main charaters are actually lego movie main charater family,
This is in June 2017 where is LEGO Batman movie because it did come out March 2017,
Woah Technology,
99 of lego minifigures havent watched the video yet,
Lego i dont step the lego Roblox i play this game,
The Lego movie was simply perfect in every single way 3,
I used to do stopmotion Now I animate,
Youtube wasnt made since 1997,
I used to make my own stopmotion home Lego movies starring a character named Guy Legopants 34 movies actually,
And *_THIS_* is 2014 Yes thats me,
I always wanted the old lego batcave with the large green screens or the newer one that had those holographic screens Instead i got lego friends BUT THATS OKAY,
Forestfire was the best ,
Lego movie 2,
That Magic Portal easter egg tho,
Ive passed by Animal Logic last week,
016 That looks like a lego version of Leon from RE2,
This was amazing Inspired Thanks for putting it together,
020 that sounds like a Really good song,
Hey vox what is the music used at 018,
It slightly gives me joy to fool myself to think that this video is narrated by Ezra Miller lol,
631 Lol that building in the background looks like the krusty krab,
But clutch powers was lit,
Alright YouTube I watched it,
i havea old flim roll from like 1970s but is gone,
When your remember the desginedbyme function of LDD,
Id just love it if I was delivered a set of Lego the bricks should be of nearly all dimensions and sizes as well as nearly every colour Thatd probably not be like that but it could,
homage is a French word pronounce it correctly,
This is my favorite vox video,
You can find the full version of The Magic Portal in good quality on Keshen8s YouTube channel,
Dang Kathleen Kennedy and co could learn a thing or to from this Respect where you came from Dont just trash it for something else Build on what was established dont rip it down,
I remember The Magic Portal good times,
2001 Lego Animation Characters dont even look like Lego People,
Personally I think fan games  films are fine as long as they dont try to profit off of it since its based on another IP,
LEGO FILMS ARENT AN OPPONENT FOR ROBLOX FILM,
Holy moly who remembers Jack stone,
Who here also binge watched a whole bunch of LEGO Star Wars Brickfilms too,
The limitations are what made the movie such a pleasure for Lego lovers to watch,
I really loved watching the old Youtube from 2005 to 2015,
Wait it was 2014 that time  oh my gad I never pay attention to the years,
This is one of the main reasons why I loved the Lego Movie,
The new one rockstar,
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER CLUTCH POWERSsorry had to get that off my chest,
Ive 100 still got my jack stone VHS,
325 the shoulder over extension is technically possible,
when your parents tell you Mom if you are going to make a youtube channel make it entertaining You sure 8 years later You thanks mom Mom why Youbecause i got loads of views and cash,
I dont know if its just me but it feels like nobody remembers Lego The Adventures Of Clutch Powers,
This is so nice on so many levels it almost made me cry,
Ive had LDD on my computer since 2009,
The old movie looked like ROBLOX more than legos,
This was a great video Id just like to also add that it isnt necessarily true that movie creators back in the day didnt know that theyre doing uncanny material but I personally feel like there was this huge ideal in the 19902000s that followed the more realistic the better We were breaking through computational power that pushed the boundaries that was supposed to blur the lines between realism and the fake and I think everything there followed suit we had this idea that now everything could become real instead of pretend everything that we simulated like legos dolls actionfigures all of it could now become as real as we always dreamed they would be But then I think we kind of sobered up when we saw the result Fully realistic ISNT always better It also kind of highlighted that we all add so different things to our play We all said yeah wouldnt it be awesome if this toy was real but then when we see a full 3Danimated version on the screen that follows one persons idea of what that means 999 other people disagree Because thats what we do we fill in the gaps of what we expect there to be but what these gaps are filled with can vary I think it is related to Gestalt Psychology where you can see a triangle that is full of gaps and still recognize it as a triangle the same way we can find highcontrasting imagery of people with few details to be more beautiful because we fill in the gap of what we imagine to be beautiful where these details are gone So I think now in this day and age we have two paths One that is still going ultrarealistic and one that is just trying to see the charm in the things as they are Like the lego movie but also indiegames that are satisfied with not having topnotch graphics but just enough,
i made a lego short for a movie project in school,
DENMARK UNDEFEATED When it comes to toys,
Finally a Vox video not about politics,
Dope i wanna do stuff like this in college,
They forgot about all those Eddie Izzard comedy clips using LEGO,
Holy shet i saw that the first day it came out in theaters and its been 3 years since damn time has flown by,
How can you make an entire video on Lego and still call it Legos,
its Lego Not Legos The plural of Lego is Lego just like Jedi,
Alright youtube I clicked,
I didnt know that it was actualy CG animated until like a year after,
Anyone remember watching ForestFire101 in early youtube and all his raunchy lego movies,
I got a copy of that Jack Stone vhs but it turned out to be Citizen Kane I am not joking btw that wasnt an implication that Jack Stone is groundbreaking and amazing it legit was the AFIs choice of the 1 greatest film ever I was so perplexed but frustrated at my tender age of like 9 that i never watched Citizen Kane until i was 16on DvD,
Whoa Whoa Whoa Hold the ducking phone Your telling me that over time animation has gotten better,
I use the software a lot even today It is so cool to get to design your creations and then build them in real life Really amazing video,
Only intellectuals remember and watched lego animations,
Bionicle 3,
Intro song Emmet fallingbin the portal,
Yall better stop talking smack about the Bionicle movie,
630 is that Anikins fighter at the Crusty Krab,
Bionical is a bad example since they have more limbs and are meant to be human like flexible,
What Im from Sydney Australia,
my brother and I LOVED Jack Stone when we were little I still have my VHS and some of the sets lol,
omg i feel old I knew exactly who Jack Stone was haha,
I remember I had a jack stone Lego figure that came in a space ship toothbrush,
I love the the stop motion because my brother and i made stop motion films when we were younger,
Oh yeah MrKrabz  155 *AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH*,

My personal favorite was always Metalzora,
217 216 Emmit uhhhhh Im having a hard time waking up,
124 The face of the devil,
Why does Jack Stone look a bit like Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 2,
You can import it into Blender a free animation software,
124 Ive just given you nightmares,
422 It was me and my friends who made that old film,
125 anakins face is scary weird,
035 INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC,

My girlfriends uncle made the lego movie XD,
I remember making these Forrestfire101 made real great brickfilms,
Roblox would be so proud,
best brick film channel on youtube KESHEN8 you wont regret it ,
In 2013 I began watching Lego Spongebob videos courtesy of Haqq17 and those were the first lego shorts I watched and reached me stop motion that was my introductory to lego films The first lego movie was Clutch Powers but it received mix to negative responses But the character Clutch was legendary even being mentioned in Lego Ninjago,
Bro I used to watch Jack stone,
525 this is such a great casestudy for how derivative works ought to be treated under copyrighttrademark law A fan makes a derivative work and Lego has the ability to shut it down Meanwhile Lego makes a work thats highly derivative of what those very fans make and everythings fine and people even seem to think wow its so cool that they made shoutouts to all the fans in the form of deriving or even using verbatim their art Anyway it sounds like Lego came around pretty quickly But not every company does and maybe the law ought to be structured so that both individuals and companies are always treated equally when it comes to derivatives by code,
My favorite YouTuber ZombieZapper uses 4 frames per second and his videos turn out greatly,

I thought jackstone was the blue guy from lego movie 2,
My start as a filmmaker was in the 3rd grade making Lego movies with my fathers old Sony cassette recorder I owe it to Lego for helping me find my passion at such a young age Its incredible to see the length The Lego Movie went to pay homage to the innovators of the genre,
The only good thing vox will ever upload,
This makes me super nostalgic I kind of want to make brickfilms again,
Lego the movie,
Can you make a video of the 2019 movie,
Im not a fan of Lego but damn this video was well put together youve earned my subscription,

You missed clutch powers,
Sometimes when Im bored I just watch Lego stop motions They are the best Something about them is just so fun,
I wonder how this studio would treat a Bionicle movie A Mask of Light remake perhaps,
My favorite was forestfirefilms101 and his LEGO Batman series,
Anakin Looks Uh Beautiful,
hey i use lego digital designer its cool,
Grant What you doing You should be at CollegeHumor,
Lego movie 2019,
its great seeing the movie in new light as we approach the release of lego movie 2,
I remember watching the original fan made lego robot chicken parodies that was probably my best childhood memory,
My favorite moment of Holy crap look at that detail from the Lego Movie was when Wyldstyle was scanning for the Piece of Resistance The readout on the scanner was stickers Stickers that shifted around slightly as they were applied in slightly different positions,
This could be done easily using software,
110 Heh I remember those helmets that would always break apart just like that I think I even had just that astronaut figure,
125 that is terrifying,
I love this and totally get this I approach every dance I make as though I am a kid Love lego Thanks for sharing,

Jack Stone was amazing had a few sets from that Good memories,
631 OH MY GOD I HAVE THAT CRUSTY KRAB SET,

Still waiting for some guy to make the lego movie in stop motion Ayyy 82 likes can we get this to 100 Never had that many likes before thx for like also,
Bionicle  one of the clips of early lego movies you showed  have a lot of manoeuvrability so it was very realistic,
Great video really interesting and warming but please Vox Lego should never be pluralzed Legos simply isnt a word Just say Lego bricks or Lego figures or even Lego models and avoid any difficult controversy,
Omg you got 2147 likes me to I want to see the logo movie toooooo,
We are doing one for class,
Thank yo for ruining the end,
studio 20 by bricklink is much better than digital designer,
bricktease channel is doing this lego thing perfectly,
I remember watching lego shorts about the zombie apocalypse in like 2010 loved them so much,
Time for the 2018 verison,
I seen it 3 times at theater,
The Lego Death Star canteen is still the best,
Lego Digital Designer also named as Roblox Studio Pro,
The first ever YouTube videos I watched were LEGO stop animations actually good times,
Wow I remember watching this one lego animation to the tune of viva la vida all the time,
Well bionicle wasnt as cant make at homeish because the animations were actually accurate Bionicles are very movable,
when you remember the zombie animations made with legos,
HOLY SHII that was one hack of a jumpscare at 432,
Shouldve mentioned Lego Studios Loved playing with that set as a kid,
This is sooo good thanks for the advice and Ive been working on my animation channel and lego videos,
Jack Stone was the first Bacon Hair o,
The lego bible was awesome and informative though i dont think it was stop motion more like a book Still great,
Remember everyone Lego is Danish,
Toy Story is doing the opposite way at first they all followed the limitations of the characters and now in Toy Story 4 they simply ignored it,
I remember making stop motion lego movie back in like 2009 Very nostalgic,
The 2000 jackstone his character is similar to The Lego City game chatacter,
God I Used To Play LEGO digital designer all the time as a little kid,
wow theyre not calling legos a bunch of nazis interesting,
Magic Portal easter egg in the lego movie I didnt see that coming when I saw that film way before the movie,
Jack stonewas the first minifigure i had,
clutch powers is the only lego movie,
I need help from anyone here for years Ive been looking for a very special brickfilm but I just cant find it It deals with a minifigure who was once homeless and was given money in turn he becomes wealthy and to return the favor he builds a restaurant named Inexpensive Cuisine Its a really nice and touching video it plays classical music and its just really nice If ANYONE knows what this video is called please let me know Ive been looking since 2009 I think,
The Lego Movie is my favorite animated movie It really had a special place in my heart No pun intended especially the speech at the end,
512 I thought he almost got electrocuted XD,
Fine YouTube *I WATCHED IT*,
Animal Logic Daniel,
What about Clutch Powers,
Vox actually has some interesting videos when theyre not being AntiSemitic,
i got to know The Magic Portal because of the Real Time Strategic Carnage site by Fleay,
024 Ahh superintendent welcome I hope youre prepared for an unforgettable luncheon,
I think mask of light aged well,
I thought it was mostly stop motion because I saw a fingerprint on Evan in the Lego Movie,
I was just ya know being quirky and decided to watch The Lego Movie earlier today and I was wondering wth how is this made Im glad this was recommended to me but the government definitely can read my mind,
Waityou mean to tell me my ceiling fan made the Lego Movie Epic Just epic,
Takes a screen shot of floating lego,
One of the best animated movies ever change my mind,
Ok but after this video I went through my dads old legs and found a toy of Jack Stone,
And Roblox was born,
Are you the ones that called 79M people antiSemitic,
Never seen fan contributions that big,
Would have been cooler if it was real Stop Motion Slackers ,
The time from 016  017 change with music is awesome,
Holy crap Lego Digital Designer Now that is a blast from the past,
ROBLOX,

EXPLANATIONS What are some of the international law mistakes in this video longexplanation Hello everyone First of all I would like to say that Vox always do a wonderful job at describing a geopolitical conflict unfortunately in this video there are many international law mistakes Im a French Canadian Law School student currently studying international law and Im writing this message because many people asked me to explain what are these mistakes next week I have 5 midterms so I wont have time to explain in details everything that is wrong in this video but I will point out a few of them very very quick Mistake number 1 at 200 Vox says that But any area that isnt in the EEZ 200 miles of the shore is regarded as international waters it means everybody shares it This is misleading because its not 100 right Some countries have a continental shelf art 76 of the The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS Basically what it means is that some countries have rights in an area that exceed 200 miles but shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured And in these 350 nautical miles art 77 UNCLOS Rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources So saying that everyone can share the resources that isnt in the 200 miles is not true all of the time Mistake number 2 lets talk about the Spratly Islands at 310 Vox says that any countries that can claim the Spratly Islands can extend their EEZ to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territories This is FALSE To understand why lets take a look at art 121 UNCLOS An island is a naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf And now in the case law The republic of the Philippines v the peoples republic of China it clearly states at paragraph 622 that  The Tribunal having concluded that none of the hightide features in the Spratly Islands is capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own the effect of Article 1213 is that such features shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf The Tribunal concluded that this provision depends upon the objective capacity of a feature in its natural condition to sustain either a stable community of people or economic activity that is not dependent on outside resources or purely extractive in nature The Tribunal noted that the current presence of official personnel on many of the features is dependent on outside support and not reflective of the capacity of the features There are many more mistakes in this video but honestly its almost 1AM and Im tired AF But Id like to point out that maybe the US does not intervene in the LEGAL conflict between The Philippines and China because the US never signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seanot because it wants to evoid WW3 English is my second language dont hate Goodnight everyone hope you liked my reply,
Dont be afraid of my friends in Southeast Asia we will fight together because we are a nation of warriors Btw I really appreciate the presence of Indonesian subtitles,
China is greedy and dangerous Almost as greedy and dangerous as the US,
That sea is only for The ASEAN members,
Im completely sure that Mexico is paying for the construction,
And then they will post an ad stating Islands for Sale 20 discount on bulk purchase,
We still name it west Philippine sea,
The Hague court ruling always in favour of US allied interest BS organisation and paid by US Why Gas pipeline in timor Sea are diverted to Darwin instead of TimorLeste Why Woodside petroleum CocoPhilppes Shell and Nippon control 100,
Lmao I wrote a few current event essays about this for global class,
If they Go to war the Team will be The UN side PH Vietnam Malaysia Indonesia Brunei Etc Probably US because it has Ties to PH and the others 9 dash line China and allies,
Think of the ECO System they have destroyed moving all that sand ,
One wrong move and it can trigger a World War III,
Theyre made in China those islands wont last long Edit Its a joke Ive had good and bad Made in China or Made in the US Seriously Im Chinese Some people really have no sense of humor XD,
what is the big fuss US is also not a signatory to UNCLOS,
Theyre opening a new Chinese Buffet Restaurant thats why theyre building those artificial Island Real fresh seafoods because your already in the sea You can dive and catch your own fish to eat if you like Grand Opening will be on January 1st 2020,
china illegally built those artificial island which is clearly part of Philippine territory a gross disrespect of international law their ninedashline claim is baseless purely nonsense and a monument of their opportunism,
They are going to own new zealand in 2020 and the cookislands is already owned by Chinese since the beginning of this year Im cookislandMaori an thats sad what China is doing,
The cabbage strategy sounds like the ancient game go,
Extend EEZ by claiming Spratly Islands Best Fallacy at the nations level,
One thing is for sure china is unstoppable,
The Cabbage Strategy sponsored by the cabbage corp and the Avatar will get in their way,
I can see why this is complicated,
Destroy made in China islands Back to original,
No matter what I think China did not do anything wrong Who ask you The country I dont want to mention kill or kidnapping their fisher man and property I dont blame China,
China may beplanning for a invasion in future,
China  Usa have really shady governments,
Are we going to ignore the fact they are building on reefs,
I dont support china,
As a Russian I like the idea,
USA WANTS TO HAVE THE MONOPOLY WHY THEM ONLY NOT FAIR USAs dream is to control the whole planet their own way If that happens humanity will be enslaved,
I live in Indonesia  Its the one that had a k island and where Bali is located,
does china know about rising sea levels,
Spratly group of islands belongs to the Philippines  the first inhabitants in the Spratly group of Islands were Pilipinos  it was discovered by Thomas Cloma a Pilipino seafarer  later sought the help of Pres Marcos to incorporate those islands under Philippine teritorries under the auspecies of the United Nation  during that time China did not complaint  but when rumors of vast reserves of oil and natural gas in the area were discovered by the Philippines  China protested and some neighboring countries in asean follows  now the problems in the west philippine sea became complicated  under unclos 12 nm  200 nm beyond your shore is your exclusive economic zone  eez  defined that all entitlements in that area only belongs to the Philippines  including oil  gas  and the fish  the question is why these claimant countries deliberately ignored the International court of Justice ,
Even though my country dont have enough power to withstand there technology Filipinos are willing to fight till the end,
And dont forget how many islands the US claimed for themselves Like Hawaii And for those people who say this happened before the UN law resolution than I have to say The same with China In 1945 they claimed the Islands for themselves,
Stop bullying Lol how ironic,
My momma always said life is like Age of Empires you gotta claim as much land as possible,
all of these islands were there for millions of years,
Dont tell its south china sea its the west Philippine sea,
This is how Fallout 3 started,
The Filipinos might be a tiny fragments for you but dont provoke us In the ancient times we were the ones who terrifies you Remember that,
What is this about the United States does the US want to divide a cake,
And they sell their people out to other countries as cheap labour China is getting rich and powerful its simply facts Terrible,
china is like loki it does WHAT IT WANTS edit no offense to THE CITIZENS only not the govrenment,
Soo WORLD WAR 3 is arriving,
*_MY CABBAGES_*,
These islands are like bomber man stages After all these hard work  Please do not hesitate to revenge against the Aircraft carriers when they are bombed By the time China make a move to Guam US soldiers are already felt asleep And what about the Senkaku Island  Will China protest forever ,
Commie China is clearly making calculated move based on survivor of the fittest they can so they do it Obama administration had shown tremendous weakness and china exploited that weakness,
Its just like the buildup to ww1 with the increased military personnel and weapons on the various borders of Europe,
Vietnam and Malaysia has been building islands in this disputed area for decades Vietnamese started before Chinese however now China has much bigger island area lol,
The US is the lone superpower in the world yeah righto vox,
idk why but the duterte philippine president is seeking alliance with china  thats crazyyyyyyyyyyy lol,
Why cant China just share like damn,
Made in China,
United States does not care if China bullies its neighbors US just wants its cut in the resources Learn history nothing is done for free,
Look at Indonesian Position really strategic Selat Malaka  Selat Sunda for World Trading  Now The name of South China See become  North Natuna Island,
The king of thieves  White Europeans and Americans  are worried as China is building small islands that doesnt belong to anyone I guess China should follow the play books of the EuropeansAmericans by invading exterminating subjugating converting and interning the originalnative inhabitants of lands they conquer Count how man natives were wiped out Wow VoAAmerican mainstream mediaEuropean mediaBrBBC The shocking how dare you news breaks from moral high ground spokespeople Wow,
China took island from small Country Vietnam and Philppin ,
And the truth is China produces lots of raw materials Parts Military Hardwares Armament at low cost needed for War Business From where among War Industry Business Ventures acquired most raw materials at low cost needed for War Industry whereunto USA duty bound as Intl Police vested by Law are Partakers on Royalty Revenue Shares West Philippine Sea are being used as a Commercial site for Chinas safe from among intruders far from Mainland China A Joint Ventures with the Philippines A transhipment point from where among War Industry Business Ventures are dramatically visiting West Philippine Sea with their Warships go round escorted by US Coastguard in a dramatic twist to happened,
Judging from the thumbnail to play a giant game of battleship,
Be happy because of global warming it will get submerged in the next years,
China is coming for America and they are not playing America better WAKE UP,
So now China is now playing battleship,
Then theres me whos thinking that Battlefield 4 has predicted war in the South China Sea xD,
The US has never ratified the UN laws of the sea Congress refused to ratify it because they claimed that would give too much power to the United Nations and lead towards a world government over American sovereignty Furthermore the US also has its own Munroe doctrine across the all Western Hemisphere The reason why China is building Islands in that area is to protect its sea lanes and keep Western influence and incursion from there Remember that in the early 20th and 19th century European and Western powers looted pillaged and invaded many countries in that region including China and they used those sea lanes to unleash havoc upon much of Asia 23 of all the trade going through those waters go to through or from China China is the largest or second largest trading partner for almost all the Countries in that region Why would they want to blockade their own ports,
The guy narrating sounds like flightchopps is it him,
well only if US retreat their army in JapanPhilippineKoreaAustralia lol,
China believes these islands belong to them China starts building structures on them China believes American soil belongs to them China starts sending counterfeit electronics to America to fill the land with electronics and claim that soil,
Tactically genius,
Classic people with their undying greed,
im Chinese but this is utterly ridiculous disrespecting territory of other countries WHILE being part of the UN security council i cant believe youve done this,
is not that usa want to protect chinese neighbors is they dont want china to be powerful,
I believe that China doesnt really need those islands for the resources Her neighbors needs them more China should switch to renewable energy instead of using oil or natural gasThis video did not mention the fact that China is really building these military bases in response to US military bases that are appearing to surround China and attempting to regulate or stop China from expanding,
After watching your videos and reading about the conflicts around the world I think that we are moderately heading towards a third world war,
Taking philippines territory also means they should accept those supernatural disasters Remember a tacloban disaster That kills alot of people Imaging those small islands being erased by a disaster Just sayin,
scripted world theatre by the world elite divideconquer the masses,
China Were going to build islands and South East Asia are going to pay for it,
VOXs kik agenda at its finest,
I love the graphics used in this video Would anybody care to to tell me what kind of software was used to create it,
This is really well made from maps to new headlines,
As i know thats named West Philippine Sea,
I mean if you switch the words China and the US in this video everything starts to make sense But wait why the US is here,
JESUS WILL ALWAYS HELP THE LESS POWERFULL COUNTRIES IN THE BIBLE DAVID WON AGAINTS GOLIATH AMEN,
Hawaii Guam Guantnamo Puerto Rico North Marian islands Diego Garca,
And now Philippines is suing the Chinese president on ICC for crimes against humanity based on these increased disputes China made News broke off in 2012 i think about a Chinese vessel illegally entered Philippine seas Scarborough shoal carrying hundreds of matured and large sea turtles also illegaly poached Mostly killed but some survived This issue sparked everything in this video talked about,
JUST LIKE THE GAME GO,
Did you say 11 billion barrels of OIL Edit HOLY MOLY 500 LIKES JESUS CHRIST THANK YOU,
China we are taking insirpation from UAE,
Killing reefs ,
and as the Cold War was stared this one will also end as that war ended,
No fishermen and has been stealing fish from the fishermen and when they comeback they dont have anything anymore,
Theyre Made in China so they wont last long D,
Theres already a ruling that says it belongs to the Philippines but China wont listen just because our country is smaller than them and has a military capability that is greater than us Gahaman sa kapangyarihan tong mga to,
Ugh China Thinks they own everything,
According to the map Philippines owns all of that,
What a biased video you are literally condoning theft from neighbouring countries,
This problem has soooo many layers And it will get worse,
i dont see them in BATTLEFIELD 4,
It doesnt support my political views so its propaganda  Everyone 2018 Joke btw no need to reply with a paragraph,
rest in peace india I HOPE INDIA MAKES IT IUT ALIVE,
Remember this world is always money and power talk Nobody will care about you,
China u greedy af m8,
*East Vietnam Sea* You are wrong,
Vietnam built their islands first Conflict is unavoidable,
China isnt even close to the see,
Chinese are rather arrogant bunch they have different type of mentality Its not so much about the Artificial islands nor a military base Its about countries like Vietnam and Philippines having no access to their own ocean front Forget about Oil  mineral resources fisher man are not even allowed to fish Cant fly over cant travel across cant fish because its South China Sea thats Chinese logic for you ,
Actually that body of water is not just the south china sea only half of that body of water is The other part is the west philippine sea,
Do we have any US claimed Islands which are under other countries EEZ,
China has become a product of the USA Your welcome now pay us back  lol lol Seriously though China has upgraded itself to the maximum with taking more land  water  warfare,
Because theyre god damn cleaver They decided the sea to build instead of erase nations in femiddle east,
I like how people dont care that Vox used *B r e i t b a r t* aka an alt right new source But when they claim that Poland is destabilizing the European Union they all go crazy,
Why is China building islands in the south China sea you ask  to make it harder for the EMPIRE to use its Navy to blockade the 95  of Chinas Exports the sail in the south China sea ,
Vox sucks but Im curious on this topic Edit the US is not the one lone super power other countries are super powers as well,
Now this is the type of thing that could kick off WW3 Not that phony North Korea hysteria,
Read Su BinGarratts case in early 2014 and you will see the similarity in the ongoing MengSchellenberg case Thats Chinas diplomacy,
so why dont explain the historical part of Chinas claim,
The more united Asia become the more the West and the white man worry The more divided Asia is the West and the whiteman will come and colonize our lands and taste our women again,
One major point that the video omitted was how China has kept the other competing claims from unifying China has kept the other countries from forming an alliance that could stand up to them if they could all agree to work together,
UN AND NATO AND US is just a stupid Organization that cant keep their member secure or they cant provide military Assistance they say Philippines won the ruling of the South China Sea Issue but still they cant Execute the Law,
This is all about the potential navy conflict between China and USA Whatever other countries in the area your job is to survive beside the two giants It is really stupid of those Japanese Vietnamese or Philipines to get involved Duturte is smart in this,
china made never last long and no warranty,
New favorite channel these guys are doing it right Vox is what vice used to be when they were good,
The US needs to solve its own problems and stay out of Asia,
Its called that for a reason What about Hawaii,
Just build a wall Mexico will pay for it,
ffs china battleship is only a game the expansion pack was fake,
The world should pay attention to what China is doing,
why does the US care OIL OIL OIL we are always where the oil is,
Soon China will have a bigger problems with terrorism And China will become test subject for bioweapon,
when i give the signs attack with no mercy hit the heart of the capital and India ground attack Japan and South Korea usa from the north,
China doesnt need Carriers they need Trojans ,
Easy resolution global warming,
US never followed the laws they establised Dont forget Cuba and South America,
Power expands Get used to it,
Thanks for the quality and quantity of the information Its of great help,
Lol its ours you see we drew lines on a map,
Not quite as neutral reporting as i am used to by Vox  Im going to thumb down the video for once,
Fishermen here in the Philippines near those said shoals are really affected by this Hope they can resolve this both parties And hope both government need to work as one,
China simplicity invade all countries by simpicity producing and sending FAKE items,
This could be one of the reason why Japans starts pumping up their military power,
China claims territory because they have overpopulation hahahahahaha USPH Unite,
The Chinese are proceeding systematically and with cold blood Steve Bannon proceeds with nothing but Testosteron Guess wholl prevail There will be no war with China But yet they will win it,
Im more concerned about enviroment in South china sea,
Sounds like the start of WW1 again if u ask me,
The red dragon starts to have big head Soon he will want to impose everywhere,
I think this is right time to be democracy country for chinese,
great video very explanatory thank you,
So basically China ignores the UNlaw to build the islands but as soon as they are finished they want to claim the sea in a 200 mile range  defined by the UNlaw ok cool,
If India wouldnt have militarized its border I would be in China while writing this comment,
Modern problem requires modern solutions,
China owns the South China sea after the victory of WW2,
It seems that other countries in the South China Sea does not bother and dont respect the ruling of the ICJ in the Hague  Netherlands  that 200 nm beyond your shores is your intitlements under unclos except of course the 12 nm entrusted to you by the UN  unclos was created to make it sure that all countries around the world wether big or small would have the same rights under this convention on the laws of the sea  The ICJ ruling was very important to avoid conflicts between claimants states  The ruling was very clear the WPS belongs to the Philippines  it is final judgement by ICJ  any defiance by the claimant states is absolutely unceptable  The world knows how the Philippines Government tolerated the mis behavior of some stubborn nations who defies the ruling  but all these showcased mis behaviours has to put an end by hooked or by crooked  We recommend the Philippines will give priorities to our AFP Modernization program in a maximum speed  so that in the near future we could showcased to the world that the Philippines was ready for faced to faced show of force in the future,
Southeast Asians are fighting for these islands including Vietnam Malaysia Philippines etc,
If the UN will do their part why not SUNCTION CHINAmongoloids is also a signatory of UNCLOS and yet their not following the LAWeconomic sunction China,
Vox is crock Its pretty obvious that those islands allow the Chinese military to place zonedenial weapons in areas frequented by the US Navy This is an issue between China and its neighbors not the US,
Scary chinese government only war can stop them that place is a economic zone of the philippines,
Dont panic climate change and sea level rising due to the ice caps melting will see these islands return to the waves,
China draws line in water What,
greed no respect for neighbors lawlessnessUN permanent menber etc,
We need to send a storm so crazy it engulf the island harp machine,
Long live to my beloved country of Vietnam We will defend our islands at all cost,
china is greedy and ignorant they cant accept the decision of UNCLOS,
America cares about bullying Who are you kidding xD,
That is why indonesia changed its name laut natuna,
We will just use HAARP to send a giant hurricane over it and wipe it out,
Chinese beings are greedy and insatiable They always loot the earth,
no its the power of nature,
the animation and explanation by Vox is always compelling and easy to understand well done,
Now whos care about the island in south China Sea hypothesis west journalists,
in 2019 the illuminati owns everyone and everything  the illuminati is making these islands  wake up,
Whenever oil is at stake the us has to interfere in some way or another,
Look at the maps at 143 and at 316 Then please listen to what the commentator said at 220 all countries but China uses EEZ The map at 316 clearly shows Vietnams claim to the islands that is also beyond its EEZ and the map at 143 is the EEZ lines This is a clear example of how biased the South China Sea issue is Just because China is much stronger than Vietnam it is okay for Vietnam to artificially build islands beyond its EEZ but not China,
Dont sink my battleship 445,
*1 answer they want more land*,
*West Philippine Sea,
Organized Military Allies against man made Island by China to keep international law  Malaysia Australia NZ Philippine  Vietnam Cambodia Indonesia Japan  Taiwan Korea  USA  India  All get together  Destroying these islands back to original shape as before,
Another great informative video from Vox As a person living in Singapore this incident hits particularly close to home On one hand we not everyone absolutely despise what China is doing at the South China Sea but on the other hand we do not want to offend China as we will risk our economic interests I do hope that this doesnt escalate into war as peace is very much appreciated in the region,
I remember back in the military when we were on a ship going through the South China Sea Chinese destroyers would follow us it was trippy,
Im Filipino were doomed though I do live in California,
I feel a war coming,
China VS The World Im Just gonna leave it here,
Shikoku island was ignored 135,
Okay what about the reef ecosystem They are like hotspots for fish,
Lack of research vox TaiwanThe Republic of China is different from The People Republic of China Do the f*** research,
Global warming ocean rises So,
All it takes it one earthquake and it will collapse under itself,
Keep building islands quietly,
This is a good tactical move by China We should be doing the same in the USA Why not make your country stronger  I do not agree with blocking off other countries or stealing their territories however,
Or cannibals have been found and need a place to live,
Why the Chinas territory include Taiwan It is inaccurate,
All I see on the map is China Vietnam and Philippines but not USA If USA is doing this This is simple China should put its interest between Hawaii and the shore of California then also put its interest and fly spy planes on Caribbean International waters as well,
oh  do not worry This is just a natural phenomenon of crustal movement We dont produce islands We are just porters of the great nature,
america says what do u want china says i want it all,
Waste of money because water level is growing everyday,
So according the graphic in this video Vox officially consider Taiwan is a part of China,
sabah is also belong to the philippine,
I would just nuke the oil and nobody can have it,
The UN international law that the US is NOT a signatory to,
I love China The Chinese nation will become stronger and realize the dream of rejuvenation,
They destroyed the home to marine wildlife They cant be contented on their own country because they already destroyed it with pollution and whatnot time to move on to other places I guess,
switch the words China and the US in this video everything starts to make sense But wait why the US is here to lose again like it did in Vietnam,
China is preparing for world war 3,
Global warming is a good solution Warm the planet melt the ice and those islands will be drowned,
I dont blame China for talking control of their backyard,
China claims they are communist nation but actually they have an oligarchy With restricted press they can take actions swiftly unlike democratic countries,
UNWell here we go again USfor oil Chinafor territory Philippinesto be bigger Votes no one will get the island,
Really Vox Steve bannon as a source,
if china doesnt have it why is it called the *SoUtH ChInA SeA*,
Hope a tsunami washes out those fake military bases,
anyone watching the video could clearly see how proximate the Spratly is to the Philippines and how far far flung it is from China,
Engineering wise these islands are highly susceptible to liquefaction I wonder what it would take to cause that to happen besides an earthquake,
100 years ago From South America to Africa to South East Asia  all the natural resources like tin mines  gold mine and etc have taken aways by forced  By Who  please comments  After they left  whats they left for the peoples  Mining Hole  Poverty  Peru  Pollution air and contaminated water  How many suffered from the sickness due to super contaminated water ,
The worlds self appointed police force trying to counter a violent baseless territorial claim by an opportunistic regimeyeh thats gonna end well,
But the international law also states that whoever locate and name the islands first owns the islands thats why the Chinese are trying to claim them they really need to fix the international law,
Naval Are China sure of that Naval was not a part of Chinese lives since they are focusing on Agricultural lands,
Well Hell they are so over populated so little space for anything and literely zero natural resources So what would you do possibly the very same thing but you dont go to war over every little thing no does one who is a valued member of the world,
Yanks invaded Iraq illegally Trump take the oil,
This time itll be the end of not just America but the main existence of every american spirit on earth,
US want China to stop bully its ally Philippines lol US didnt even provide a bullet for Philippines to stop Marawi siege While China provided US10million weapons to Phillipines to stop ISIS No wonder Duterte show the middle finger to his strongest US ally,
Filipinos are triggered,
Chinese government should stop claiming their neighbouring countries territory based on historical claims which date back centuriesthousands of years ago,
I believe there is a mistake on how you marked Taiwan a separated land from main land China Though there are disagreement on what country is Taiwan part of it is certain that it is currently NOT part of China Also Id like to add that ROCCurrent government of Taiwan controls the biggest natural island in the south china sea Taiping Island The Island was part of the The South China Sea Areitation mension in the video 603 LOVE THE CHANNEL BTW,
U leave out a part which why this all started bcos Obama foreign policy to contain China economic growth by using us military to persuade Chinas neighbor to block Chinese shipping route,
Just give it to Canada Thanks,
That island belong to phil Not for china Phil won international law china greedy did bot respect Their power will be useless,
NOT Chinese Communist Party propaganda is in full force trying to take what is not theirs The South China Sea is an international waterway Period,
Much as you hate China when making this video you still names there southern china sea Okay,
C A B B A G E,
This is what happens when the US meets a bigger bully,
NonsenseUSAnone of your businessget out of SCS,
Who else is here for MUN research,
C3 D7 F9 what its *not* Battleships And using Steve Bannon as an authority for *anything* U wot mate,
China is planning to build an island slightly larger than Mexico 201 miles away from US west coast,
They are trying to get one of the islands in the Philippines where we get our electricity Edit The island is called Scarborough Shoal,
I got to say I have to agree with u with these islands They are doing the same thing in the SOUTH PACIFIC with money though and its hurting the government and the people so the millions they give and the longer they take to pay it back the more power and money they r getting,
will prove difficult to maintain above rising sea level,
9 dash line is pure hogwash,
Did vox mark the island of Taiwan as being part of the PRC,
it is saddening to hear that my country is being bullied but GOD is watching,
South china sea is totally wrong name ,
every time he says south china sea i lose eight years of my life,
God bless America from South East Asia,
All your base are belong to us China,
Vietnam Philippines is the first built island we are behind but we are faster and better,
055 096 J20,
Very cunning and smart people,
Damn the Russians for trying to take back Crimea that was a part of their country or 150 years Damn the Chinese for trying to take control of    wait for it    the South China Sea Amazing how our liberal media is ready to fight WW3 with countries that are just minding their own business on the other side of the world But people actually invading our country We have to let them in,
China is a bully and the UN and international courts are like my class teacher not able to do anything about it,
Ive heard of the new but I didnt expect china to be this greedy They want to take it all,
Philippines is the most affected to that damn reclamation,
604 Hold on a sec please name one international court rule that the US obeys This should be interesting,
Indonesia has changed the name of the South China Sea to North Natuna Sea,
What a great waste of sand,
You mean West Philippine sea,
its none of your business,
Never seen malaysia got that long *screen time*,
someday they will claim mars or other planets,
Great ruin the few healthy coral reefs we have left Its not like the great barrier reef is already on its deathbed,
So predictions are real,
Hello  Who wants to play Battle Ship ,
Its a heinous thing  China stealing the Philippines soil in Zambales to be used for shoal reclamation The Philippine gov must do something about it China does not only steal the soil but also claim the Scarborough Shoal which is not theirs Its an international crime they are committing but no one is doing something about it,
A airport does not make an airbase Perhaps the island are fishing ports The USA navy blockaded Japans oil supply before the attack on Pearl Harbor Where is the proof they are military bases,
If humans come from apes why are there still apes is like saying If children come from adults why are there still adults,
We fought the slanty rice jews before and we will be glad to again,
Why does America keep on minding China and other Asian countries business Why dont yall just mind your own country,
China is greedy notochina,
Imagine China presses his domination in the sea and bullies the other countries The US comes to the aid and WW III starts But suddenly it is revealed that China are working on a secret project in the ocean Before anybody could win GODZILLA emerges from the Sea and destroys all the naval forces The world unites against godzilla and in the end defeates it and kills it Finally all the countries come together and live in peace Little do they know that there are hundreds of Godzilla eggs lying on the sea floor Imagine xD,
I can see why building islands makes sense Whats wrong with having a rock quary out in the sea or ocean Just a big minning spot or more than likly a rock quary  I think itll work out just fine,
635 why u bully me,
Why exactly is taiwan included as Chinese territory lol,
Can someone explain why UN fails implementation of law Or why International waters are not just left alone and used for transportation only,
So they were trying to starve those 8 soldiers to death or something,
Coz they are not domi heads,
This film makes a huge fallacy It assumes that China continues to have economic power in a world where the USA becomes more isolationistWhat they fail to realize is that Chinas current power is 100 dependant on US not being isolationist The USA will be fully energy dependent soon and with the new USMCA they can now build in Mexico for less that they can in China Once the US unplugs from middle eastern oil and from European finance China will see its economic engine run out of gas,
Its mother trucking West philippine sea,
This is not complicated They are not islands they are big barges They boats They are ships and should be treated as such,
why how about ask why US have military base everywhere in the world,
Thats gotta be really reckless,
who that islands are filipino but claim china ,
CHINA ,
The western countries are getting worried when China is resuming its super power Kinda fun to see how they are freaking out lol,
Damn I didnt realize it was this bad This is ww3 starter worthy,
You can try doing a documentary on the ruling win by Philippines Despite it has some issues however the arguments make are worthy of looking into it,
Like sitting and can easily be destroyed by typhoons Unleash Japan,
Looks like they need more people on these islandslets start deportingthem from the US 1st Rangers,
This like a opening to a Call of Duty Mission,
314 Putins voice We need to get more thoroughtful consideration Voxs subtitles They are mad dogs WTF,
He Protecc He Attacc But most importantly He *Hacc*,
313 putin just said that we need to treat everyone with care I dont get where all these mad dogs came from the subtitles XD,
In mother Russia spy controls government,
Putin looks like James Bond AND a Bond villain at the same time,
s s,
Subtitles is wrong Im Russian it feels like you specifically do this Hm,
This is the problem with Vox They change subtitles to demonize Putin Hes not necessarily the best leader but Vox just makes him seem like pure evil,
Vox *dispassionately outlines Putins rise to power and notable actions during his rule* Everyone _WESTERN PROPAGANDA THE US DID WORSE HAHA NOT SO SUBTLE NICE TRY LIBS_,
we know Russia has its own propagandabut this is USA s propagandaboth sides tell half of the storyits funny how its fine when USA invades Iraq and kills 12 million peoplebut when Russia invades a country and kills 2000 people thats unacceptable,
Fun fact President Yeltsin was arguably the most unpopular Russian leader in history even worse than Tsar Nicholas II,
I like you Vox but this is a BIAS report,
PutinThe powerful man in the world Russia Ur amazing Love from India,
Putin *becomes president* Later Putin The president before me was bad so I will make this country great again Repeat,
As a Finn Im honestly scared how polarized the world has become Europe used to be diverse ideologically but now its either left or right like in the US and we cant even have sensible conversations anymore,
Vox should probably have paid someone that can actually understand Russian as the subtitles are completely BS,
Slavic people need to unite behind CAR VLADIMIR VLADIMIROVIC PUTIN,
You should make video on USA dark side,
This almost seems like its the opening to a movie,
I would get defensive too if a hostile military alliance with 14 times the spending bigger than mine continually pushed closer and closer to my border,
Putin not the guy russia wants not exactly a good guy but what russia needed,
Make a video on Modi too From a tea seller to the prime minister of India,
One of those oligarchs is the owner of Chelsea,
I dont know how you got the translation from 315 to 318 or what you translated but in the video Putin said We need to carefully treat such cases,
314 Putins voice We need to get more thoughtful consideration Voxs subtitles They are mad dogs,
Hate him or love you gotta admire what hes done,
Say what you want about Russia but you cant deny that they are incredibly tactical,
funny thing  US is doing the same thing almost  oh sorry yeaaaah financing ISIS etc even worse but that is OK but when someone is starting to be more powerful than US he is baaaaaaaaaaaad and comunist and evil and basically Russian,
Man propoganda is becoming more obvious nowadays,
Boy I love the way these Vox Guys edit the videos,
This is apologetic US propaganda,
you are disrespecting him by calling him president he is our tsar bro,
Ukraine More like MYkraine  Vladimir Putin,
Crimea *votes to be a part of russia* The whole world OMG HE JUST INVADED UKRAINE THIS IS ILLEGAL GET THE DAMN NUKES This video is so biased,
1 unbiased video on Putin please I beg you,
Cyka blyat to the West Long live Russia,
He was bothered by the US invasions in the Middle East He must be a crazy lunatic The US did such a good job of killing hundreds of thousands and leaving those countries devastated and in turmoil,
Im no Russia apologist but I hope you do realise Vox that all those things u accuse Russia of doing USA does aswell Just slightly more deceitful and intelligent in doing so but nonetheless they do it all too and more,
Haha businessman made him rich but now he controls them,
In every video made Vox i find that US is the innocent one in every part of the timeline Funny,
Im pretty sure Trump has all along actually been Putin wearing a fat suit disguise and an orange wig,
Turned the country into an authoritarian and militarist society Damn I was pretty sure they were a pacifist liberal society just before Putin huh,
Stalingrad Leningrad Putingrad,
Are there any Canadian watching If so can you tell me what Vladimir *POUTINE* taste like Im trying food from other countries,
Man blaming Putin for Hillary lost Man the victim mentality is strong here,
Russias economy is weaker than before the sanctions but not as weak as vox said mostly because of its oil and gas that they sell to China and other Asian countys aswell as to some European countrys,
Putin is by no means a good guy but this is thoughtless low quality antiPutin propaganda,
Welcome to putingrad,
Yes keep him heel revive the soviet union,
This Video is brought to you by the Department of Propaganda BS of the United States,
Of course the United States politicians are not corrupt to the core as well of course not,
Voxs editing and production value is insane It always blows me away how clean and aesthetically pleasing your videos are,
Does anyone know the genre of the repetitive serious and suspenseful sounding sound effects in background Or where can I get such music,
If we live in a game Putin is the player,
East Germany joined NATO in 1990,
553 United States no *uN1tED rU551A* *y35*,
As a Russian Id like to say that we have some benefits from living under Putin  we get to play a stateoftheart George Orwells 1984 simulation    ,
Putin Is a half genius or a fool he knows how to play with his enemies but he brings bad things to his people,
Despite what they say many Russians like Putin,
Putin is living in a real Game Of Thrones style of life,
Russians You do know 4chan and darkweb is a thing You can whistle blow there Also we anonymous may help you Just show us the sign and we will Destroy Putin,
Not 100 accurate but who cares this was interesting,
Thug Life videos should start with a clip of Putin Cuz he SaVaGe,
417 those dudes are effin GORGEOUS OMG they can oligarch me anytime anyday ooookay,
Nice propaganda Bit too obvious though,
Opening is so same call of duty XD,
This video is blinded by indoctrination,
Fake news,
Indo For Rusia Sahabat,
Vox is so liberally biased but they have amazing editing on their videos lol,
Putins not just a presidenthes the kinghes just awsome,
Soviet Russia was way better,
Sounds exactly the same as USA regime all over the world,
Ukraine Russias fastest growing import John Oliver,
He isnt a president hes the emperor already,
Well its rather obvious hes no neutral viewer in this video,
Vladimir Tootin,
Damn Hate him or not but when he walks the stairs along the music you have to admit its epic,
Putin as of right now dealing with the western world isnt doing anything wrong,
Uhhh why is russia considered militaristic when the us military budget is about 10 times higher than russias,
USA has the biggest propaganda remember how they favoured Hillary in the ellection,
i am sorry vox but this video is one sided,
Putins the king,
Voxi boi you forgot a conflict with Apkhazia and Georgia which was totally Russias plan,
The Ukraine part is partly wrong The president mostly was on Putins side its the opposition who wanted to be with europe I mean just look at where Yanukovich is hiding now  in Russia and wanted for crimes in Ukraine Also lots of important details are missing and all of that makes the whole video very questinable You shouldve made it longer and prepare better,
pure brainwash just confirmation bias all the way,
456  Russia in 2008 defended Abkhazia from the attack of Georgia,
He sorely underestimated his operatives in the States,
Soviet Union 2,
The West horribly underestimated the patriotism of Russians With the fall of the Soviet Union the West presumed rather arrogantly that Russia which now dominates what was the Soviet Union could easily be sheperded into Western alignment and things like MTV and dubbed soap operas would suffice to ensure Russians would love NATO etc Meanwhile Putin was buying time and strengthening his vision of an aggressive Russia Along came the terrorist attacks of 911 and the US along with major NATO countries became focused in far flung places and fighting totally unorganized fighting units of terrorists hiding in holes and caves with small arms etc Meanwhile Putin waits watches and then seeing the US exhausted after Afghanistan and the debacle in Iraq tests the waters by making moves in Ukraine getting involved in Syria and wow the West cant do a thing and dare not do a thing against Russia Game on Like it or not the world is rapidly hurtling towards a massive and bloody conflict Russia and I must say a large number of Russians are set to defy Western domination  Russia will not forget its rich history culture and it will not be cornered or undermined The problem for the rest of the world is that the potential nuclear conflict between NATO and Russia will affect everyone on this planet,
I LOVE PUTIN Disclaimer i aint GAY,
Music name,
2019 NARENDRA MODI joins the chat,
The personality President putin Hats off The great,
who made this  the CIA ,
It would be interesting if you could make an episode of what China is doing to in claiming other countries territories in Asia,
In Russia the state owns the media In the US the media and big corporations owns the state,
i love that man,
Putin has such a strong team of hackers that they hacked vox and even dropped a dope track at the ending of the video along with Putin walking like a boss,
Watch out for all the Oxford history professors in the comment section,
Video *talk about Putin and Russia topic in the video and the title* People wHeRe iS thE Us biAsed PrOpAgRANda,
Start of the video Me Lets see what I can learn Half of the video Me Hmmstarting to get skeptical 726 Sabotaged Hilary Clintons presidential campaign Me Ahh now I see what this is Thanks for the western propaganda,
You could say the same for George HW Bush Head of the CIA becomes president,
he protecc he attacc but most importantly he hacc,
The Classic Vitas Father,
Fix your subtitles when he speaks lol,
Why would he care he is a business man not a politician,
Vladimir Putin is a great man,
Atleast the man has balls to do what he does and he does it damn well switzerland son when will you grow some balls and come outta neutrality,
hail Putin putin is the best  love from,
Do a better research about the conflicts,
Annexes Crimea there was a referendum,
Haha Russia has the same military budget as England and were 100x smaller,
IF HE SAVATAGED HILLERY CAMPAIN WE SHOULD THANK HIM becuase everything that has been reveled about her has been true,
This video is making the US war mongering politicians and corrupt generals bloody hands washed,
Dodgy subtitled and only a single questionable source,
726 of course Cmon try to be a bit more objective,
*looks at comments briefly runs away to grab popcorn spends hours reading 12k comments of political debates*,
Russia has a Bond Villain and America has a Carnival barker This only ends one way,
Sanctions have actually gotten harder on Russia since trump became president,
The KGB is now reformed and called FSB can you please do a video on that,
Hail Vladimir Hail Mother Russia  This is gonna burn some guys,
just realised that we could do a lot of things with that image of Vladimir Putin,
how is it that gorbachev and yeltsin praised by the west are hated by russians maybe becuase the interests of Russia and West are opposite and when one prevail the other is damaged Putin is praised by russian and hated by the west Watch the russian gdp of 2001 and compare it to 2016 or the demographic growth seems like bad Putin does his evil stuff pretty good uh,
US Russia is still paranoid Me Look whos talking,
Hes just another person whod do anything to stay in the top of social pyramid like any other whos already known the true power,
Portugal Loves Russia,
Notice how nobody in the comments actually tries to argue against what the video said but instead cries But look at what America did1 Whataboutism at its finest,
USA media is most biased they call terrorist attacks on other countries as just bombing,
james bond 007so what putin number,
VladimirPutin,
I dont trust chimpanzees that wear suits,
When the video gets to Chechnya at 315 and it shows Putins response to the bombings  subtitles dont fit what hes saying like at all Hes not even taking shots at them hes just saying Everyone should be careful Very off putting Considering the effort thats being put in their editing it appears that they take their viewers for complete bonobos,
Militaristic sociaty  Yes but not so much as the EEUU LOL,
He protec he hacc but most importantly he hacc,
Its not all about Russian and the USA Russia has a very large country on their border that is starved for resources and well known for trying to retake historical territory such as Siberia which once was part of China China also has a shortage of women due to their long onechild policies and Russia has an excess of women If I were Russia I would be nervous too ,
Half truth is a Lie and thats what VOX and many others like it is all about BEWARE of all HalfTruthers,
Putin is just good at Risk,
Vox Orange man bad for making friends with Russia,
*president* Ah yes the Russian election Who are the options to vote for Hmmmmmm okay so we got putin andPutin and OH putin,
This video is like 50 truth 50 propaganda,
451 I didnt know that they went to Slovenia Im Slovenian I love this,
Im not saying that hes a good man But in politics Putin is an brilliant strategist and tactician Machiavelli would be so proud of him,
i like red  so i will support russia ,
Im getting Destroy All Humans 2 vibes,
He might as well be tsar of Russia Because he refuses to give pirendisy up,
Sounds like a modern day Charlie Luciano head of the five families equals more power,
Now I see why the western world is afraid of him Smart strategic dangerous,
to all the people saying its propaganda would you care to elaborate  i honestly have no knowlegde on the subject and it would be nice to write something useful,
*putin wants to know your location*,
Putin hosts meme review,
Hi is HUYLO Its everybody knows,
this is a bad propaganda lol,
Vladimir Putin is quite attractive for his age Id go there Oh yeah,
What if he is a double agent,
Straight forward way to say all VOX,
This one of the best openings to a video Ive ever seen,
Putin is guilty of everything in the world from starting World War 2 to nailing Jesus to the cross wait that doesnt count since the West actually hates Christians,
Love putin work his work and love for his country From india with love to russia,
Stopped watching as soon as you said russia sabatoged hillary in 2016,
This what are you saing is alternative hystory,
Please do a video on how USA works,
You didnt mentioned Gang Group Ozero Facts shown in the video are true but its just scratch on the surface btw Im russian Russia will be free,
Do people not realize this is literally how it works everywhere,
Vladimir Putin is terrifying,
italy love RussiaUS sucks are just an english colony and French are Gay frogs eaters,
Isnt Vox owned by Ezra Klein part of the Jewish regime Lmao Great edits tho Vox,
Really Russia is in very good shape and we are in December 2018so you are wrong,
wait so CORRUPT GOVERNMENT PROBABLY LITERALLY THE RUSSIAN MAFIA THE RICH GUYS RUNNING RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIAN POLICE all supported this guy before he was even that popular,
310 I have not seen the original full footage but in this particular moment he says we have to thoroughly examine all examples of such  ,
And of course everything Vox posts has to do with Trumps unfair win,
Well how do you say that Russia invaded Georgia with no context whatsoever Why didnt you mention that Georgia lunched an attack on civilians in Northern Georgia,
TRUMP Also went From spy to PRESIDENT Did they went to same school ,
NATO should have been dissolved after the fall of USSR,
Now this is a 2019 comeback,
How can you speak so onesided from the prespective of the USA,
Or trump could strengthen NATO and make them unstoppable to any country or alliance going against them,
Hes 66 Damn I didnt know that Guess you learn something new everyday,
TIL Canada is not the west,
RARARASPUTIN RUSSIAS GREATEST LOVE MACHINE,
Donald Trump is going to be impeached though What will Russia do,
Wish Putin could be prime minister in the UK,
Just like how Hitler was a spy for the government and became a Fuhrer,
Information Infrastructure Being a certain type,
yeah this is propoganda,
Putin is awesome,
segundo esse video o ocidente o estados unidos,
Vox the new ministry of information,
You could say the same thing about George H W Bush Putin is a POS but that doesnt mean we arent too,
sorry Vox but some info are totally biased and almost make no sense,
I am proud to be russia friend  love from india,
Putin is badass Russia  Strong America  Pussified Millenial Cucks,
Putin is a modern day Stalin,
OhAssad is defined as a dictator Thats new,
Youll find that exKGB is best MC in exCCCP,
the pronunciation is awful but the video is good,
I love this man Regardless of all western propoganda this guy is awesome,
*BUT WHAT ABOUT EVIL MURCIA THEY INVADED IRAQ* *BUT WHAT ABOUT EVIL HILLARY* *BUT WHAT ABOUT EVIL OBAMA* *BUT WHAT ABOUT EVIL ISRAEL* Russia Today,
what if Trump is helping Russian win welp im moving to Moscow,
but is he global elite,
you went from deputy mayor to prime minister in a sentencewhat happened from 91 to 99,
Global altright movements originate from Putins information campaign  They downplay his role in Trumps election and in scrutinizing information against Clinton,
thx god a lot of these 5kk viewers know what lies u talk,
Russian 007 who became president,
I dont like you Vox but thank you for noticing the Russians,
Voxs video effects and videography is probably the most interesting and fun to watch in the entire youtube Hats off to that,
Putin If you see Mikhail Gorbachev Tell him I saidHELLO,
So putin killed max 30k and us killed 500k i wonder why US is protected here,
All the people talking about bots in the comments are saying suspiciouslysimilar things,
It is a shame that a video that could inform people ends up giving incorrect information,
From America long live Vladimir Putin and his citizens,
This man do posses character and power,
BRAVO SIR PUTIN,
*MAKE RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN*,
I love how everyone is attacking the US and theres a war zone while no one can invade Florida because we have a Gators and my neighborhood is loaded with glocks lololololollol,
Theres no such thing as a former KGB man Vladimir Putin,
110 One of the oligarchs is the owner of an NBA franchise thats nice and you probably freaking know Already,
stay strong Chechnya we will find peace,
Hey 224,
From spy to president The rise of George H W Bush,
 Putin is dead But Russia is still smart and the strongest,
Biased news call other news biased smh Talk about hypocisy,
So Putin is bad because 1 He reduced inequality 2 He killed terrorist 3 He jailed corrupt billionaires Okay got it Also the CIA has the ability to plant Russias digital footprint anywhere they want Russia is probably not involved in most of the cyber attacks they are accused of Even the ones where there is supposed evidence as the CIA has the ability to fake that evidence,
I love the Music it went intense to badass,
This is so true about Vladimir Putin being a spy because I know you have been spying on me I see you,
I loved screenplay of vox,
what putin was 40 at 1989 he would be 70 now,
This is Western PROPOGANDA blyat,
All I can say is that this video was only partially accurate but mostly all I see is aggressive statements being made over situations which lack evidence,
First of all On the map Luxembourg is a lake Why I would like to ride a boat on Lake Luxembourg,
And at 728 is where any credibility you had goes right out the window,
500 Didnt Georgia attack Russia first,
That beat at the end though Vox what is the music called,
At 313 hes actually saying  You need to be cautious in these kind of events  I have no idea why theyve translated it that way,
That ending was lit,
Now this is a man of immense intellectual strength collected rational powerful,
Vox you used Tide or Persil for this brainwashing video ,
Putin is an extremely interesting man He has taken control of Russia he has billions of dollars probably and he has been destabilizing western governments,
A great personality and a great leader respect from india,
Vladimir putin is the most badass on the earth,
here i was thinking this channel is unbiased HAHAHA,
This was definitely very one sided and doesnt help show people the complexity of the situation like what certain American and NATO actions have made Russia feel threatened Honestly this video will most likely make westerners more paranoid about Russia which just diminishes communication about American Russian relations,
Trumps been president for 3 years already Holy cow,
As usual its always those pesky Russian hackers,
We need an update,
ex kgb This is the guy id let in my Secret society Free ma Son,
Cyka Blyat,
Putin preparing for ww3 and whats after,
Long live Putin,
Thanks for the political agenda,
NO COLLUSION,
So Russia is similar to the US in foreign policy and corruption no surprise there,
Putin knows what he is doing but sadly doing it in a corrupt way,
4 z mada lan,
20 STALIN,
Stateowned propaganda machines vs Privatelyowned propaganda machines Conclusion THERE IS NO FREE PRESS ANYWHERE,
Annoyingly simplistic blatantly onesided and like many others in the comments have already correctly identified containing factual falsehoods,
Rather have Russia as a global superpower rather than China,
Putins the world president,
Its just crazy how dramatic this video is with the background music and the commentary it gives you chills when youre high,
respected for Putin,
This video has a really good music choice,
Who else love his walking style,
Putin is a cool guy I would be friends with him,
IF I BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA I WILL MY NEW WORLD ORDER,
Honestly i dont know why it is such a deal that Vladimir was a KGB agent That is Russias own secret service like the CIA why are people so hypocritical,
OK now do a Documentary on George WH Bush Sr From CIA Director to President Whats fair is fair,
Its funny that if Putin didnt hack the election they think Hillary would have one,
Oh just incase you forgot Of course they tried to sabotage Hillary clintons election,
your analysis is biased,
Ukraine is a freakin joke totally inept and corrupt imbeciles run that country,
Tywin Lannister irl,
How can you not like this man,
your editing is real deal,
Vox is always bias No support for this channel,
Slava Rossiii god bless Putina,
Its like im playing hitman6,
That ending while Vladimir putin was climbing the stairs with the music is so epic Its called Black vertigo,
TRUMP LEFT The CHAT,
Thank you Donald Trump for making Putins job easier,
When Russia makes military drills it is AGGRESIVE When NATO makes drills on Russia border THEY SEND A MESSAGE The double standards Just imagine the press if in the place of Saudi Prince killing the journalist was Vladimir Putin,
What the music at the end,
I like Vox because one moment youd almost think theyre right but then they undermine themselves by mentioning how a state investigation found it inclusive Then theyll keep the ball rolling and hope you forget,
That outro music is pretty dope,
On 315 they completely put words in his mouth he said a completely different thing  I know Russian ,
Nice job putting up fake subtitles for a random clip of Putin speaking on the news during 309  317 Im an American citizen but Im done with this fake journalism idiocracy,
why is this so left biased lmao,
I hope Russia destroys the biggest terror state of modern times  USA,
last song,
Russian news is actually pretty good when it comes to international affairs Russia Today RT is a great youtube channel funded by the Russian government translated into many languages No ads too youtubecomuserRussiaToday,
459 Fake Propaganda In 2008 Georgia started the war This was confirmed by the UN,
the kremlin trolls will be out in force so many russian girls wanting to get out of the place which is the good news,
Still no evidence that Russia tried to sabotage US elections 2016 enough of these lies and speak facts for once,
I live in Russia I dont like Putin either but its not THAT bad,
He is true leader putin the great,
Whats the name of the music in the ending,
Bro he was 36 at 1989,
This is what good journalism looks like,
America  Builds a wall to keep illegals out Brazil  Builds a wall to keep its own people out,
tourists are temporary but residents are permanent Rio needs to understand this,
Its crazy and sad how they cover up poverty like this As if they are embarrassed And they dont even help them,
I lived near to the intertational airport of Rio and can say that all what this video said is true I remember when the government put those walls in the sides of the road between the airport and the south zone and it was very clear the true intention of it Rios government has lost control of the city,
This is why I love Vox Way better than Buzzfeed pathetic attempts of journalism,
This sad but very real Thanks for sharing A real eye opener that seems to all over the planet,
And now two years later the olympic park lies empty deserted and in disrepair The public parks that were built are fenced off the athletes towers are empty and the stadiums are boarded up,
So rio is covering the poor just to make their city look good Jeez Brazil shame on your government,
Well Im Brazilian and I need to say this problem isnt restrictred to Rio Were currently in a political and economic crisis because our governors are focusing on making more money to them leaving the population apart Brazil looks like a beautiful country with nice people living in it but believe me its not only that Oh and violence is just growing up I mean A LOT,
Brazil should stop acting like its a first world country and focus on what really matters,
This is what the main stream media doesnt show,
Brazil is gold medal in corruption I guess,
Rio is turning into a dystopia,
Brazil is not a Paradise but we advertise it as one so we can continue to get Foreigner money Brazil is slowling turning into a Giant Tourist Trap while millions suffer,
brazil has waaaaay too many problems to host something like the olympics,
This needs to be EXPOSED to the WHOLE WORLD These sons of pigs  segregating the impoverished and the rich,
As a Brazilian Im gonna tell you guys the truth Rio is one of the most beautiful places in Brazil however is one of the most dangerous too Rios police is the most violent *in the world*  a lot of hospitals were forgiven because of this stupid Olympics dont even ask me about the world cup Im from So paulo I love Brazil in all aspects but the corrupt government of this country is letting Brazil into a hole Sometime ago the brazilian people got FURIOUS then the truckers from all the country stopped working the country went into a caos the markets were running out of supplies animals from farms were dieing without food all the prices were getting so high president was trying to do a lot of deals the gasoline prices increased from R360 to R480 sometimes even R500 a liter As I said I hate this countrys government and if it doesnt get better Ill get the f*ck out of this place,
The sad thing is everyone in Rio knows everyone in Brazil knows and the world But the thing is just get worst,
I remember an episode of the Simpsons where they went to Brazil and they got accused and even threatened to sue by the local politicians for portraying Rio negatively by highlighting poverty crime and corruption Since the Olympics its amazing how much of this was found to be true,
Oh boy You should also see what the Chinese government did in preparation for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 Heartbreaking as well,
Rio de Janeiro todays drowning in debts They stopped to pay their professors at federal colleges a time ago they stopped to having classes The healthcare is more horrible than before the crime rate is increasing even the army needed to intervene in Rio favelas again The government cut their education budget for A HALF The future of that state is dark,
Back when Vox were still good RIP,
poor belong to no country no Brazil no India no China no united States Pathetic,
Im brazilian I live in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro a neighborhood called Bangu and I just want to say good job Vox Youre doing good by showing the real place that the foreigners will be visiting Im a little upset that you guys only showed the North side of the city cuz we have some pretty nasty stuff in the west zone too but its okay *Im sorry if my english is kinda bad I had to learn by myself by watching tv shows and movies people with knowledge are a threat to the government then they dont provide it*,
uhh have you heard of Detroit or Chicago Highway systems have been built purposely to dived cites to prevent lower income communities from being able to mix with and interact with other parts of the city where there may be more opportunity A highway a blatant wall all countries do it America is just better at hiding its poor through selective advertising,
I live in Brazil all the cities are like this,
Horrible I never realized how sad and real this situation was Thank you so much for sharing Vox,
the irony is that almost all of the olympic park in brazil is completely abandoned,
its stupid that they only want to impress the world and not their own citizens,
Its very difficult if not impossible to fix an area thats controlled by organized crime,
All this for a bunch of little games,
Brazil has been a lie for ages They should sell their entire Land to those who can take good care of it,
Its free real estate,
Brazil is like that lonely kid in class who wants to be with ereyone else,
I live in Salvador brazil one of the capitals and here the city hall help the communities reforming homes of very poor people is the best city hall of brazil,
You should do a 2019 update of Rio now that the Olympics have passed What is it like there now,
Country that can organize Olympic and World Cup  but can not organize a good living for people ,
Well in Manila Homeless human on the center island on the road will be brought to a resort by the Department of Social Welfare of the Aquino Admin on the POPE VISIT in the PH,
Wow i live next to Brazil in Uruguay and i never knew any of this,
sweeping things under the rug solves the problem in the short term then one day you see this bulge in your carpet and you undercover everything,
BRAZIL IS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD JK but maybe Bolsonaro Will fix this,
I love how they spend money on the the Olympics and World Cup stadiums that they will never use again,
and now look at the Olympic park used once  abandoned and useless forever,
Streisand effect The harder you try to hide something the more obvious it becomes,
Really nice work by Vox  showing the other side of image,
RRs are not pronounced like H in portuguese,
Heck I live in the United States and in Washington State near Seattle and here you see it all The poor people lining the streets the thugs grouped together in dark alley ways and the occasional drunk homeless dude taking a piss in the road Theres no wool pulled over anyones eyes I mean when you think US you think uptight happy people but its far from that in its most populated areas so I have to wonder how bad it is for the homeless in Rio because at least in the US the government tries to get people off the streets and working but in Rio it seems theyre just making the problem worse by pushing these poor people into crowded areas where crime will inevitably increase,
Brazil acts like they are a top 5 nation in the World,
My parents are from goais its a state I remember we were in rio to go to goais and I saw past the wall and I felt sad for the people who live here now I just experienced how it is to live here my grandma neighbors some of their houses are decent but some have graffiti on their house walls and everything is way too expensive,
If the public know this they wouldnt host the Olympic in Rio,
This is what happens when you divide people whether between the poverished or the rich the Latin or the Caucasian the east or the west You ruin the stability of the world the entirety of it,
Brasil is a mess now Rio de Janiero is bankrupt right after the Olympics and World Cup So much corruption in brasil its amazing,
Everyone knows countries only show people good things because no human just tells you all the bad things about themselves off the bat they want to make you keep your good impression of them,
The rio Olympics bankrupted the country nice going,
Ive visited Brazil in the winter months and I remember how the further South we traveled the colder but more white washed things became The south of Brazil was very developed and urbanized and too similar to where I come from the USA than I was prepared for The North was what you would expect Brazil to be like,
Keep it up Vox  THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW WHATS HAPPENING,
Why is it when a major sporting event is hosted it means an excuse to knock down loads of buildings,
Frik the Olympics it ruins so many cities and is a waste of money,
The question is if internationally this problem is well known then why the Olympic rights were given to Brazil at the first place,
It happens on every olimpics Atlanta Greece Sydney they all demolished thouse stadiums after olimpics,
When greed controls traders and the government corruption spreads and the future of the poor is lost,
Rio is a prime example of socialism doesnt work case closed,
Ah dont worry At least youre not like the Filipinos who imprisoned poor children so the Pope wouldnt see them Go Philippines,
Wow Unbelievable but this is the world we live in,
Man  and i thought it was bad in Pakistan  turns out Govts are corrupt every where ,
Rs arent pronounced like Hs in portuguese whether its brazillian portuguese or european portuguese What you mean is that in european portuguese the Rs are pronounced stronger than in brazillian portuguese maybe thats why you thougt they were Hs,
PLEASE COME AND DO ANOTHER SERIES ON BRAZIL our president is the worst incompetent and petty and rio is falling apart due to the new governor policies,
Exactly the same thing happened in China Beijing 2008 Olympics,
This is about to be the worst Olympics ever,
Gentrification at its finest,
While in the Philippines informal seatlers refuse to be relocated,
The letter R is NOT pronounced like H in portuguese,
When the Olympics was In Mexico City there was still dried blood on the streets from a protest that the police fired upon,
Vox  Exposing news the world doesnt want you to know since 4 March 2014 good job i luv ur vids,
Meanwhile in Metro Manila Oh wait Brazil and Philippines are like twins Both rich government huge poverty and corruption ravages on,
Rs are pronounced H in Portuguese Dafuq did I just hear _,
WHAT Rs are pronounced like H in Portuguese its a Russian R a doubled R should have a scratchy sound to it and its also more elongated BaRra,
We cannot ignore this problemwe need to help fix this,
i had no idea this was happened or even if it still is and i like 6 hours from rio thank you vox,
brazilian portuguese sounds so sexy,
113 the only person how talks good english is from portugal not from brazil,
Great map in Mw2,
Oh well This is Brazil My country Bloody hell Brasil um sonho intenso um raio vvido de amor e de esperana terra desce ,
A wall  That is literally hiding the truth,
2016 Olympics What Rio doesnt want the world to see aka the reason I watch Vox,
I came here from a video where they were showing butts of some hot Brazilian girlsI was happy,
so they spend money on a wall that can pay food d for 1 week,
Bring back Emperor,
Just imagina 500 families starting to build their legit housing in Central Park,
Se pelo menos ajudassem essas pessoas sem condies ou construssem casas bairros Esse o Brasil,
Luiz Cludio Silvias eyes are pretty Is that random,
 2016 Olympics What Rio doesnt want the world to see _Correction_ 2016 Olympics What Rios *POLITICIANS* doesnt want the world to see,
T H A N K S G O D Finally the americans know how we live,
Inequality not terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity now,
Lucio lives in that favela I bet,
Damn This breaks my heart,
didnt this just happen with the world cup two years ago,
613 how the hell does he have a Tommy Hilfiger shirt,
Wasted money on a thing that will only last like a year when they could have wasted it on the poorshocking,
gets one chance to live born in brazil mfw,
I come back to his video a few times a year not only because it was my introduction to Vox but because it manages to break my heart Every Single Time Tremendous editing and journalism Kudos,
so Carlos Carvahlos is Brazils Donald Trump,
Property developers control political decisions all around the world not just in Rio,
Amazing Loving your videos,
I love the sarcasm from the vox interview Those watching the fellows from the same city starved turned to be homeless aloofly watched them to be beated by police I call them Vested Interested monster They are manipulating Brazilian democracy to destroy people from different class the poor one and to dismantle house of those people people offering labour to survive They are the one being exploited Shameless Rio,
Brazil us Africans in the US love you,
Welcome to Hell de Janeiro tourists Dont get your hopes high,
Rs are NOT pronounced as Hs in Portuguese hun,
They coulda reallyfound a better way of explaining that one Vox is garbage though,
Wait Rs are not pronouced like H in portuguese Barra is Barra not Baha like you said,
Brazil should of never got given the Olympics the country clearly tried to cover up the poor,
I went to Rio for the World Cup in 2014 I thought that city was lit af and rich but I didnt know about the North Zone A Brazillian native I know told me about it and I was pretty shocked but not surprised My home city Saigon is pretty much the same Has both beauty and slums I still had a good time but Im not going to Rio for Olympics Tokyo here I come D,
Rio just got EXPOSED,
I cant remember the exact event The Commonwealth Games I think but in Melbourne Australia this was done on the route from the airport to the city 100 true I lived in the area being covered and I was perplexed and cross,
Thats what happened in Italy Tourists visit only Naples center so they dont know how the rest of the city is Tip its almost as bad as Rio de Janeiro,
Another example of a greedy and irresponsible government failing its people,
Rich get richer Poor get poorer Its so sad that its that way,
Just came back from Brazil The place is so deceivingly beautiful From afar everything looks wonderful but look closely and its all superficial still had a good time though The people were really warm and friendly Also the place is really dodgy but ironically on several occasions was shown real acts of kindness by these so called problem people,
Theyre really lucky they have had the World Cup 2014 Olympics 2016 and Copa America 2019 smh,
My god Seriously building a wall to cover their own people,
Thanks for making and sharing this video actually have a new look about Rio,
But I loved BrazilNow I want to t see the real one,
I was about to visit that place Im glad that I seen this videolol I dont want to end up there,
This is a global problem  which could be easily solved w better education  which inspires pride and better living conditions for all You can be penniless and poor and still live with a sense of dignity  instead of like an animal Fundamentally humans are just animals  and some regress to that level because of lack of education and standards  the battle of the classes will forever be waged as long as there are those arrogant who believe they are better than others because of Money which is the furthest from the truth,
Lol before the olympics all yall just ignored it,
Vox should replace all those crappy cbc cnn global tv news channels The world needs a reality check not more greed,
All this for just one world cup Definitely not worth it,
when youre going yo make a vdeo about Venezuela,
What the hell Rs are not pronounced like an H in portuguese,
Rio doesnt want the world to know about this Well guess what Rio Vox just let the world know,
32K currupt brazillian men disliked this,
This Is So Sad Alexa Play Decpacito,
This is mean every body should be treated fairly,
This is left wing biased journalism we need to reform journalism makeamericagreatagain,
After the games this park will be like so many other Olympic Parks empty and useless Why cant we just have one location for the Summer and Winter Olympics and keep it maintained Most of the structures they build never get used again Its just senseless to me,
This is ssooo heartbreaking,
I am from Brazil and the best thing about all of this is that when the world cup was being held in South Africa and they made THE SAME THING to that peoplehere in Brazil the TV was showing with some proud I may add the same reality of what was really happening there And look what weve done to ourselves,
Empire or Republic I want to ask this to Brazillian,
R is not pronounced as an H in portuguese dude lol,
Poor people dont exist if we cant see them,
After the 2016 Summer Olympics a lot of the buildings in Olympic Park were left abandoned,
In the end billions of public REAIS kkkkkkkk Excelente video Cheers,
Heavy government control is ok,
I am Brazilian and Rio could never hide poor people because many ones live in poor communities called favelas in hills visible The country had the biggest slavery in the American continent and the last one to have slavery until 1888 Cities like Rio de Janeiro and Salvador that were Capitals of the country and received many slaves have a big percentage of black and mixed people and many are still poor On the other hand some less dangerous favelas with beautiful views attract even European immigrants and here is an example httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviJkz9n22pk8t256s,
i have no idea why the olympic committee thought this was a good idea,
Brazil is one of the most corrupt and dangerous countries to live in The olympics should never have gone there,
731 APARTHEID that couldnt be more true,
Thats terrible More people need to know about this,
*slaps Brazil* This bad boy can fit so much corruption,
brazil is a joke same as their football team,
So sad how all of those facilities look now Instead of reinventing it for the ones who dont have a place to sleep,
The problem is always the government So There should be no government,
Good article showing the true reality of Rio,
As long as the people of brazil stay strong they will outlive the corruption,
Stay honest vox we proud of you,
Same thing happened to the citizens of Atlanta when the Olympics was hosted there,
Im portuguese and Rs are not pronounced Hs xD idk who taught you that Awesome video tho,
Its like Malaysia They like to maintain master slave relationship instead of everyone being prosper,
Thank you for sharing a place I will never visit in my lifetime,
Thank you for reminding me again why I subscribed to this channel ,
Countries like this should not be allowed to host the games if they are doing this to their own people,
002 it look like space,
I tot Most Country Has It To Prevent Sounds From Reaching The BuildingSo Its Not That Loud,
When you make a wall but cant feed people lol,
Im going to skip this years Olympics This is sick,
309 Rs are NOT pronounced as Hs in Portuguese Only in Brazil Same way North Americans pronounce many of their Ts as Ds instead,
In India there are these same types of houses but thank God the government never tried to at least hide it from the outside world,
Nobody deserve this BUT ME,
Nobody deserve this BUT ME,
This made me think of Michael Jacksons music video they dont really care about us the one where hes running through Brazil,
40 MW2 MAP OMG 40 CAPITALISM IS BADHEHEY2GEJEIEYU666949411* 10 poor people List of comments,
Dude Rs are not pronounced like H in Portuguese,
Power corrupts  Absolute power corrupts absolutely,
I knew something felt odd about this World Cup it felt dead,
Hiiiii I m from India your big fan Please add subtitles,
Its funny how that rich developer planned to make barra as a new Rio but now the entire 31 Olympics village is abandoned THE IRONY,
give that woman a cookie wow Awesome video by the way ,
listen to Brazil by Declan Mckenna,
I dont know how but I am always moved in the exact same way after watching this video My eyes are filled with tears Stellar production Vox,
If you want to see real despair you dont need to go far just look at Detroit or any small town in North East of US,
Great mini doc wish I could make something like this Great topic and narration,
Its not just in Rio all around Brazil there are large areas of land populated by the poor which we call the favelas after moving to Canada I really started to miss my hometown in Brazil I remembered it being beautiful but after a family visit I never want to live there again its sickening how far the Brazilian government ignores the poor I guess thats what corruption does to a country,
Instead of spending so much money for the wall they could have spent it to improve the living quality of the peoples there,
hmmmm watching this in 2018 bout to be 2019 BOiz,
The wall is used to reduce noise pollution from the cars,
so is rio pronounced as heo,
Im brazilian from Rio de Janeiroand right now my state is almost bankruptedjust because the publicMoney billions of dollarshas been used only for the Olympic Games instead of our education health or security Billions of dollars which were spent to satisfyUNGRATEFUL foreigners in a 20 days event while millions of people are really bad under the rule of a corrupt government while they see their country being defamated by ignorant people,
And FIFA is angry at Qatar because workers dont have air conditioning What a Hypocrites,
That wall isnt even trying to be subtle,
This Olympics should never have happenednow the city is drowning in debt,
This is what governments do They pick the winners abolish government,
this is china level cover ups,
Brazil built the wall before Trump did lol,
I had no idea this was happening great video,
These informative videos are Voxs only good videos Strikethrough is trash,
Just a point Rs are not read as Hs in portuguese,
Governments are the worst no matter which country you are in,
What he conclude is correct all around the world Poor beeing moved and still they will be poorer again,
Forever will see Rio in a new way Thank you so much for enlightening me along with others,
A wall separated a street and slum Whats wrong with that,
Hi Just a question Where do you get the maps in After Effects from,
Rio is me when it comes to money,
chicagos plan was way better yet rio still got picked,
yeah then I saw the video of the citizens robbing tourists it seems those politicians are not so different from the people,
Im pretty sure its just pronounced Barra dude,
well people who live in favelas dont pay taxes either,
Man if you guys were this objective about Hillary Clinton,
Wow Another Berlin Wall Mar Wall,
We could fix the problem so we look more presentable or we could just hide it behind a shady border,
That last shot was perfect Where the tree slowly covers up the shanty town complex A visualized representation of the overall message for the video,
so this basically Yugi oh 5D in real life,
Brazil hosted the World Cup just two years ago Holding two major events so close to each other is too much for a poor country,
Olympics this generation is a biggest scam All over the world No returns or benefits to the people,
Comment to the sound editor at about 155 theres a high frequency pitch the kind that CRT screens make thats so loud did something go wrong,
050 is that douglas silva from city of god,
So if Barra is pronounced Bahha why is Rio still pronounced Rio and not Hio,
China did the same during the Beijing Olympics,
America is no different,
This world is becoming more corrupt,
Thank you for showing the reality,
Essa olimpada aqui no Brasil foi tudo para desviar lulinha e demais devem estar rindo da nossa cara nesse momento,
They should just pick a rich country to host the Olympics Poorer and developing countries should focus on the problem of their country first,
Bravo Well done Thank you for exposing this in Rio so simply and clearly Its the same all over the world well in most parts Especially the US now Greed and profit over people,
My president once said i dont care if we dont have tourist i will keep closing establishment without proper sewage treatment Philippines,
A wall doesnt solve anyones problems *cough cough president trump cough*,
U think this is bad Then welcome to Mumbai India One part is just made for richest people and other are living like nothing,
Rio is a mess finances are in shambles the police arnt even getting paid and many of the facilities for the Olympics are yet to be finished add on top of this a outbreak of Zika and its becoming increasingly clear that Rio wasnt ready to host the games,
I stopped watching Olimpic games since I was mid 30s now I understand why,
Im Brazilian and I have to say good job Vox Excellent journalism,
The philippines is taking care of manilas slums so it can be beautiful again but rio doesnt want u to know what the city is hiding,
Well maybe it worked 20yrs ago but theres a thing called internet now so u cant really hide anything lol,
reminds me of that one simpsons episode about rio They got a lot of backlash about it from the gov saying its a stereotype Now i see they were mad that the cartoon was showing the real side Not just the glamour side we always see on tv,
I think every country needs a Robin hood again,
People talk about the US and UK being bad got ya,
This is probably one of the main problems of the Olympics,
And u just gonna expose them like this,
The thing about favelas and poorer brazilian districts is that they are where a lot of brazilian culture is generated Many of the footballers dancers musicians artists etc come from these places the community spirit is huge and that stuff is what makes brazil unique Hopefully something will turn around in brazilian politics because it looks like the left wingers have had their day which is bad news for the poor both in rio and elsewhere,
btw no Rs are not pronounced as Hs they have a re sound so barra is really barra and not baha as you were pronouncing it,
One of the best vox videos ever,
I live there There was a lot of controversy in that time,
They should have not hosted the Olympics,
Reminds me of how Hitler acted like everyone was accepted in Germany during the 1936 Olympic Games despite everything happening there in Germany during the time,
I live in Rio de janeironot in a favela in the North Zone but i know the sad reality of this city,
You know every time I see a verified Youtuber they always comment like Haha amazing video And the replys are like AHHAAHAHAHA HEYY I LOVE YOU AND I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVEEEEE Why dont we treat them normally Like Yeah I agree this is a great video and I wish youtubers commented like GREAT VIDEO,
Vox is fake news  just like CNN  just like BBC but this isnt fake,
I think trump inspired brazil to build a wall,
Brazil is extremely corrupt An I am being generous,
The more passive PEOPLE become the more y will loose getactive,
Ehhh understandable Makes sense Good job Rio,
One more reason to mourn for humanity,
this is just sympathy bait for the poor and outrage bait against the evil rich standard modern day media narrative,
This happens too in Jakarta Indonesia It will happen if government dont think about public housing in the first place and people can live where they want eventhough its illegal,
Vox is where its at Better then other channels imo they cover so many topics so well,
Im from Brazil and man thanks for making this video,
Would love to see one of these creative works on Belize,
Dont act like America is any better Detroit schools have mushrooms growing on the walls,
i love every video keep the good information body,
Que uma viso do Rio de janeiro tiroteio toda noite e no resto do Brasil tambm acontece muito,
120 sarcastic god,
World cup also same like this this is why brazil lost 71 to Germany,
Going in Brazil Need education about the culture I have a solution liveleakcom,
EXPOSED,
Im Brazilian and I must say this is not wrong Our country is BS We need a lot of improvements We pray B17 will fix our broken country,
My wife loves her country She is from Rio It took many years for her to finally admit how Fed up Brasil Rio is Rio makes it difficult for outsiders to buy Real Estate too All of them are Crooks,
Editing is a valid discipline recognised by Colleges worldwide,
yeah the government is here for us right,
Why hold the Olympics in Brazil anymore If the areas mayor is putting money into lifescarring projects that cost millions of dollars DONT MAKE IT WORTH IT FOR THEM It is a unforgetable image of seeing your house get demolished or important people who were being tormented by brutal police force JUST FOR MONEY Anyway that is my saying on this horendous act that has been committed,
Dont forget that building stuff like this also creates more jobs,
Mostly derelict now after the Olympics,
great infoHorror in Rio,
Heres a pun How does a evil villains sound comes while laughing Bwararararara r is spelt like h in Portuguese or Spanish or whatever,
A wall trump would be proud,
Honestly the world is cruel and disgusting,
Rio smells like new money dresses like fake royalty,
It makes me sad to see the divide between rich n poor makes me angry to see the elite abuse humans this way why cant the people revolt as one,
one of the reasons why i like vox is that they talk about things the rest of the media doesnt bother covering,
I love how they correctly pronounced everything and didnt over pronounce or englishify any of the words,
Sounds like the HOA owns them,
I stay out for a year now and I know the value of a House I can feel the sorrows of these people Hope they get a place to settle,
please do video like this for Azerbaijan,
244 why does she say black people Is she trying to say that all of the black people are poor,
Spent billions on Olympics that are an economic burden Couldnt even shell out a few tens of thousands to maintain their largest museum which does attract tourists and researchers at a much lower cost,
The Brazilian government is triggered,
this kind of thing are also happening in indonesia when theres certain event occur that invites foreign people come the goverment suddenly despreate to make the city look good but only JUST look good,
lmao why even choose Rio for the olympics,
I remember studying abroad in Brazil while the olympics were happening and Rio was so energetic but on our drive from the airport I remember those walls along the highway and how full of disdain I was knowing what lay behind them I love Brazil so much and I hope that Rio can get some reform,
Same in China Before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 walls were built in poorer areas The government cared more about its fame than the people,
I live in rio and i can confirm this,
Those bus lines arent finished yet  and the stadiuns at not schools,
I live in Rio in the south zone I am white and speak english and have two problems with this video 1st The mayor and governor arent cleaning the city up ONLY because there is international attention there has been an underlying sentiment among the elites that the south zone barra and downtown were getting to many settlements and there was starting to be too much crime and poverty in those areas which leaves me to point number 2 Gentrification against those settlements isnt necessairily a bad thing There is great real estate next to beaches that could have nice affluent buildings built however these ILLEGAL settlers have created HUGE there are some with 100 thousand that are centers of crime drug trafficing and violence therefore it doesnt seem that wrong that the poliece remove these people from inhabiting this land that many times were supposed to be natural reserves or simply isnt theirs Just a thought from a real person from Rio for you to think about,
Wow This doesnt affect me so I dont care,
Rio just got exposed,
This is another face of evil,
Identical selfsame duplicated situation and tackling technique in China Im not being critical Im just being objective,
I offered to have the entire Olympics in hell but was told that nobody would swim in my Lava,
I live in Brazil but in a little city called Bauru  its nice and calm,
Lol the airport at the beginning is not RIO but I am an airplane fan so I care On behalf of all airplane geeks,
Rs are nor pronounced as Hs in portuguese I am portuguese,
Make more videos like this,
Scroll back up Buddy it aint worth it,
Wish me luck bois Im scrolling down,
While Britain is just sitting there with some popcorn,
Sometimes I like to imagine all commenters put into a room together and see how long it takes for them to kill each other,
So basically its the Brits fault as usual The IRA the indian pakistan thing palestine africa etc etc etc,
If only British and french didnt carved middle east it would be more peaceful than today Then they just wanted oil,
I understand the importance for the separation into two countries by UN but I dont understand the reason for such a confusing border Seriously the borders look like they meant to incite violence Same goes for British partition of India and Pakistan,
I m diving down the comments  wish me good luck,
the third intifada is happening in the comment section,
Im just here for a school project,
Conclusion british is the reason for this mess,
Vox you forgot to mention the 1973 Yom Kippur War a result of another simultaneous arab invasion of Israel which the Jewish people won and on top of it it agreed to give Sinai pen back,
Its UN fault They created ongoing Arab conflicts until this day,
As someone who has read about a dozen books and done countless of hours of research into this conflict I can assure that virtually everything in this video is accurate however dont be fooled into thinking that you can form a position on this conflict from watching a 10 minute YouTube clip The truth is its quite hard to form a proper position on this conflict without doing hundreds  if not thousands  of hours of research into it which isnt very practical for most people,
I typed in unbiased and I got a vox video Yeah YouTube is broken,
The historical starting point of 1900 is convenient to Vox agenda,
British messed up with IndiaPakistan too similarly in 1947 Now 2 nuclear powered enemy nations,
No mention of the Pill Commission Some more small problems but other than that I think it may be the most objective video I have seen on the history of the conflict Like you say in Hebrew Kol hakavod,
Youve lost few facts along the way,
I think Ill go to my neighbors house and say God said this house is mine because its bigger and prettier than mine and see how that goes over,
Goes back only 100 years Are you kidding,
It was all working perfectly till Britain stepped in,
Its not brief and its not simple Lie 1,
I think theres an error at 821 1000 Israelis and 3200 Palestinians died So the graph labels should have been switched around ,
Israel the place where two foreign wolves voted on how to share a Palestinian lamb,
Overall this is a pretty good history lesson One point of disagreement it is stated that Israel put a suffocating blockade on Gaza after Hamas came to power They do not explain why aka Hamas AND the PA were caught smuggling in weapons to attack Israel with Remember the CraneA,
Who else is in the comments just to see people arguing with each other,
Conveniently not mentioning the fact that Egypt also closesopens its border with Gaza lock step with Israel Painfully brief and over simplified Vox you can do better,
The conquered palestine,
I support palestine from vietnam,
of course the British fk up and then just leave just like they did to India Pakistan Bangladesh who were all one country,
I would love if Vox made an episode about the Brazilian corruption scandal No one outside Brazil even knows whats happening and how bad it is,
This is a similar way when British take over north America and killed all local people,
This killing had begun since abraham,
Explose Russia you judge heretics by rocket,
so main reason between Israel and Palestine is British empire,
ok but like what is the piano piece at 220351 cuz its good Dont worry bois I found it Its called People by Laurent Durey sorry if I slept the name wrong,
You forgot to mention how Israel try to bargain for peace 5 separate times yet each time the Arabs refused,
This looks like Tom and Jerry Tom is the pet of the house and has the right to live in it  but Jerry is the one that lives in the house by force  I mean without the owners approval   So Jerry should leave If he isnt allowed to stay  where  That is his problem not Toms or the ownerss  Note  Israel is jerry  Palestine is Tom Most of us liked Jerry and agreed with what he was doing like most of us are doing now with israel ,
That thing you mentioned in the description for the video you have mistaken it it is supposed to be IRAQ,
So the UN can decide to slice up any country that they want to,
I gotta write a two and a half page summary of this wish me luck,
If only you were stronger,
Britishers divided India and Pakistan and Israel and Palestine They I guess loved to divide And now in both cases people are dieing and unending violence I hate you Britishers You made us free but you sow seeds for violence Very Good Technique,
200328,
Stupid BritishCarved out India and Pakistan and Israel and Palestine Can they ever do anything right,
Can you make a video of ArmeniaAzerbaijan Conflict ,
Asking for the liberation of Palestine isnt antisemitism its common sense And people who use the they have rejected the peace bargains well yeah because those include Israel keeping the land they *store* and are *invading* Free Palestine,
How can you support palestine when israel hasnt even started a war And palestine declared war on them,
Very educative Learned so much with this vid Big shoutout Xoxo,
I hate when pro Isreal say Hey that was our land 3000 years ago were here to take it back I mean do you really imagine Italy saying to the UnitedKingdom Hey that was the Roman Empire land 2000 years ago were here to take it back  Pure nonsence,
The Flamewar dow below is just people going apeshit over each others ethnicity,
*_Wouldnt having exclaves and enclaves in jerusalem solve the problem or is there something im missing_*,
Biblically it wont get any better Prophecy will fulfill itself Destroying all,
No mention of the McMahonHussein agreement SikesPicot or the Balfour Declaration,
Love israel from india,
In four days this vid is gonna be 3 years old,
Yes two RELIGIOUS GROUPS,
as a Muslim I want peace for both,
857 I thought they would just split not fall in a civil war and then split,
Happy togetherenough is enoughstop cry stop war2019 a new hope,
yeah we just never gonna get along,
Uhm this border thing is very confusing,
Dramatic changes yup it will,
i hate my countries,
wow vox updated the video not long ago,
You know that the other countries surrounding Israel still try to destroy it Especially Iraq And also that Israel proposed more than 5 times the creation on the Palestinian country for peace which they denied,
SO let me get this straight Israel occupies palestinian territories in the West Bank and starts to build settlements there  World USUN Heeey thats Illegal but no sanctions for you keep it on Russia occupies ukrainian territory in Krim  World No way SANCTIONS  Btw Im against the russian occupation there,
We are wasting our time both Israeli and Palestinian dont want peace,
Civilian want peace with each other but the selfish politicianextremist dont allow so ,
Just realized this channel always has the dopest music wheres it from,
This video earned yall a sub,
British left this mess as they did between India and Pakistan Boils my blood how the British rule ruined many countries,
**gasp** I cant believe this *_ISRAEL_* XD,
Well  I see a little piece of information that you missed on how Egyptians got sinai from israel in 1973  it would take you days to tell the story  Shamefull to mention ha,
i just watched that whole video and had not paid attention to a single word,
What are you talking about There is no Israeli occupation LOL,
The UN has to be the most useless organization of all time,
This is just wrong,
mind blowing ignorance too much for a comment section read up people dig a little you might find a real truth,
Complexes that formed during ww2 genocide are being projected towards innocent in gaza,
Hey Book recommendations written by Israeli andor Palestinian authors preferably both on the situation I want to hear from both sides of the story and learn more about it Thank you,
619 Theres 750000 immigrants in Palestine,
hiit is Falestima felistina NOT PhalestinaJuish are extreme agressorsimply just forget the religians and be a good and UNITED that is strong weapon,
middle east countries are fighting with each otherand benefit goes to USA,
Balfour declaration Lets  britain please a lot of this is our fault,
The middle East is such a historic region so many civilisations were born there there is so much culture and history but unfortunately war is messing everything up I hope the Israelis and the Arabs will find a way to restore peace ,
I want to give a like but its VOX why would I do that Im never giving a like to VOX,
Well that was VERY brief,
Israel is a shining example for people around the world The Zionists have shown evildoers everywhere just how effective terrorists tactics can be in achieving goals,
Very well explained,
Watch the greatest story never told,
If Arabs gon put the guns down we will see peace but if Israel gon put thems guns down the next day there is no IsraelFAX,
Wow I just learned about this today I never knew this was going on Very interesting,
how can we reach peace when even the comment section is on a raging war not all of them,
In before the comment section turns into cancer,
RIP to all the victims,
I need the soundtrack,
Thanks for this video,
I should have watched this before the Jubilee video came out,
Whoa whoa whoa Completely glazed over the Six Day War and said absolutely nothing about the Yom Kippur War,
DO NOT WATCH VOX*yt puts their BS on top find a better source,
Why cant they make Israel and Palestine that whole area on the map a simple one state,
We all know this land belongs to the vatican,
I love how all these people in the comments base their comments of this video This is a very very complicated conflict and only watching this video isnt enough,
I am of Israeli decent and I respect Palestinians and Muslims I wish we can all have peace one day,
I hope all around the world learned this from Indonesia ,
Noooo I want Palestine we are not doing anything,
Great short and unbiased Thanks,
Invasive slowly with money and power,
so all of this is germanys fault,
how about giving those land for tannu tuva,
Watching this for homework rip,
a brilliant video thanks,
You havent mentioned who supported and still is supporting Israel financially and militarily,
Problem is religion,
And kosovo is a country,
Came here in preparation for watching the middle ground Jubilee video Thank you ,
Bro why didnt you mention the 1973 Yom Kippur war,
The issue is complicated the animation in the video make it harder to understand,
Mention the nebi moosa riot The starting,
Holy Land,
Long Live Israel,
when you start a war and then blame the people youre atacking,
Well Looks like Hitler had a point,
Why is he starting from the 1900s I dont understand Anyone,
I hope the Palestinians get the bomb,
Free Palestine,
why cant my history class make sense like this video,
Just give it to Rome again and be done with it,
Love to Palestine from USA,
seems like this wouldnt be an issue had Germany won WW2 Tsk tsk,
Here is what I have found about the IsraelPalestine conflict No one and I mean NO ONE can explain the history fault lines and motivations of both parties in a way that both sides can agree is fair I once tried to develop an objective view on this and it felt like swimming in a reverse vortex Id spin around a few times then get spit out This conflict makes me a realist feel like the most irritating waffling postmodernist one can imagine I just hope there is peace and justice in the end,
Whats the piano song,
Piano at 225,
WE NEED AN UPDATE,
227 honestly that is exactly what it was the jewish population had no right to form a country juda was long ago,
One thing is clear from all of this mess the interference of foreign powers is evil,
Soooo Israel fought back won and did what ever country does take more land Hell they are luck to have been given what they have,
thank you vox,
Im literally writing a paper on this right now Before this conflict started the leaders of Iraq teamed up with hitler because they had the same enemy and they were big fans of his This is super biased Again Both sides have been through so much but please dont let this video be your only source of information Make your own opinions by watching opposing viewpoints and more like this and then more opposing viewpoints This topic deserves it,
Some people move on but not us Not us,
I love how the majority of comments here are talking about the comment section itself and not the topic,
Msg to the arabs stop starting wars and live in peace,
Can someone share me the script of the video please,
How about the papacy goes on another crusade,
im from palestine,
Parts are true parts are completely nonsense The thing here is that this conflict is much biggest then that accuse is the borders of Israel Its connected to far away Arab states ideology and the want to destroy Israel from one side,
345 wheres the UN now,
There was peace til 666Jared Cushner brought conflict with his fake peace plan that sided with Israel take over Trump  bibi  devils that hate  Fact Anti semitism  anti palistinans  peace,
Israel didnt give Egypt sinai Egypt conquered it with the element of surprise,
As a third party personIm from East Asia I can understand Israels motivation here though I wont say I agree with it Israel does not have any actual ally near its borderline while Palestine and Arab countries still do not give a sign of trust that theyll stop trying to wipe out Israel when situations change in the future like what they did in year 1948 Yes the way Israel treats its Palestinian counterpart is definitely wrong in detail But in the big picture it is impossible to set your weapons down if it seems clear that your enemies will not allow your very existence as soon as it becomes a practical option The colonial empires  in this case the UK  are the only evil side in this problem And I think the key to the problem is mutual trust among Israel Palestine and surrounding Arabic countries,
I stand with Israel from South Africa,
lol watching this for school,
616 wheres the UN now,
Really makes the blood boil,
Israel was backed by the british and America in all the wars,
The west bank is my land land of the prince of israel thus the lord settled it with palestinians that now when he removes them with famine and the smoke from the north the 12 tribes do not contend with me that the Lord has made me a herritage amidst the tribes and that the poor of his people will feed of it Jeshurun Elijah The Purger Witness of G_d,
Palestine you will get what is yours Love from India,
It is not all I know because I am in Israel,
What is the song at 339,
As an Egyptian Muslim watching this I find this video the most unbiased so far All the others that I have seen prefer to take sides Either portray Israel as this white knight with squeaky clean history or portray Hamas as the noble freedom fighters that only care for reclaiming their lost lands Im no politician but I see that both sides made mistakes from the start till this very day Oh and congratulations you just earned a new sub D,
Yup cyprus got captured by england,
Begin  Sadaat  Peace Jordan is PALESTINE,
They should join states and become one awsome country that can be peaceful and strong,
Both want peace Both deserve peace,
And who supplied these new Jewish immigrants with all their weapons No second guesses needed there,
If Youre interested in this subject I highly recommend you seek out podcast Martyrmade Life and Death in the New Jerusalem There may be a slight bias displayed by the presenter but thats probably just my perception Its a great few hours of listening and very informative Youll leave it as a better informed person for sure,
love Israel and Palestine from China,
im not pro or anti zionist i dont care myself imma stay neutral i have jew friends and arab friends so im not biased,
Sugar coated history,
I want Peace for Israel and Palestine from USA,

Israel ruind the chance for peace when they kicks the arabs,
1973 war,
The real Israelites were black As was Muhammadactual name Mur Hameed a Black king,

Just to mention for the all israel haters i know im late but 2 months ago after 3 years of silent 800 rocket was sended to israel in 24 hours destroying houses and killing whole familes Edit when we bomb gaza we atleast clear the area from innocent people and tell them,
httpsyoutubeIFmJeeCZ3dc,
Rip my country ,
so are we going to give america back to native americans,
0336 you failed to mention that Arab countries STARTED the 6 day war,
Both sides are right and both sides are wrong,
thats not even very many deaths hahaha wtf,
1948 so if the Arab nations never went to war for Israels land none of this would be a problem correct,
Doesnt matter how objective this video can be the Israeli supporters will never show empathy to the occupied,
Just Give everything to Cyprus there problem solved,
comment section is lit,
What about Rothschilds contribution in helping to form Israel,
036 looks like Elijah Wood,
900 as I can see Gaza have border with Egypt so what makes Gaza to be closed,
Did you really glaze over the 6 day war with NO mention of USS LIBERTY Really helps paint the picture of what theyre about Tighten up,
The worlds most hotly contested piece of real estate A pile of rocks,
what is the music at 244,
Another AntiIsraeli video First some numbers 1 Palestine before 1948 was a general name which included the land of Jordan saying that just for historical correction 2 You claimed in the video that the descendants of the 1948 war consist of 7 million in numbers While you show in the picture that the numbers of refugee in this war is less then 750000 How could they be 7 million if 70 years ago they were 750 thousands 3 The PLO was founded in 1916 Not sure if I heard you correctly Because the PLO was founded in 1964 and even then it didnt see itself as a national movement 4 People should talk about the fact that there were some how talked about Palestine independent country the majority of them saw themselves as part of the big Arab country vision and wanted to be annexed either by Egypt or Syria see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiIndependence_Party_Mandatory_PalestineThe PLO was established with the same notion The real nationalism of the Palestinians came to greater extends in the 70s and the 80s 5 You really diminished the effect of the Oslo Accords in which Israel gave the Palestinians 95 of their inhabited territories in the West Bank and yet Israeli saw how the violence only grew afterwards So saying that most israelis kind of lost hope in the peace process you need to better explain why Until today Benjamin Netanyahu asks from the Palestinian leaders to recognize the right of israel to exist as a jewish state withing the 67 border and they still refuse to do so,
Appreciate how you were not biased however maybe you should have discussed war of 2006 and 2009,
Music at 221 anyone,
How about Sinai and and West Bank for Palestine,
LONG LIVE ISRAEL,
Like someone who came to ur house order you than steal you wife and you get outside,
The key to peace is a collective feast of Oreo cookies and milk There I solved the IsraeliPalestinian conflict We can all go home Youre welcome,
So many lies in one video The Hamas organization calls to this day to destroy the State of Israel and shoot missiles at it There is no siege on the Gaza Strip because they have a border with Egypt Egypt is an Arab country and the Palestinians can get everything they need from Egypt Israel did not expel Palestinians but they fled in 1948 after the leaders of the Arab countries promised to kill the Jews and then they could return The 1967 war also broke out after Israel was besieged and its destruction was planned Stop the Palestinian lies,
As a jew i want BEACE jk peace will be great,
Make palestine brittish again,
im just here to read the Comments *casually eats Popcorn*,
Peace please,
I hope nothing happens to lebanon,
Its absolutely mind blowing how many mindless sheep are pro Palestine,
Israel and the neighboring states fought another war You means the arab countries teamed up tried to wipe israel off the map and lost,
215 that British flag is bothering me,
Waiting for War war 3,
Nice that they didnt mention how the six day war started,
hey cool men,
Nice Britain Here in India we fighting with our own brothers,
Well made video no doubt but it was wrong about something important When the Arab armies invaded Israel upon Independence they did not wish to create a Unified Palestinian state they wanted to grab it to themselves This is important because hiding this fact can give an impression Palestinians are more separate from other Arabs then they really are In reality this separation is little different then the one between Iraq Syria and Jordan  European enforced with little more to it Another large miss is the never changing goal of the Arab armies and Palestinian militias of their Jewish question The Jewish expulsion from Arab states is also ignored which makes over 50 of Israeli Jews Ignoring this makes it easier to see Israel as colonial and the comment that extreme Israelis want to destroy the Palestinians is laughable That argument only goes the other way All this together can give the common wrong impression the conflict is more about how much land people control rather then security and acceptance of the other sides self determination Which is the larger tobesettled issue,
Look up 5 minute video Origin of the word Palestine,
Israeli zionism will eventually manipulate the USA into their own war while we suffer and they watch only to take the spoils at the end,
I support the Israel,
As an Israeli I wish for the day of the 2 state solution,
Anybody know the music at 238,
All my family want is peace but not in todays world,
Badly worded but Im not gonna dislike,
Could you please share your sources,
Israel offered a state 5 times to Palestine palestine refused all them even when Jerusalem was mutual city And Israel only responded to Wars and planning of wars against Israel,
Violence destroys the world,
Seeking independence through terrorism Wont work youll get slaughtered like the pest you are,
Every word of this could be true but since its coming from Vox I have to assume theres a huge spin on it,
Viva Israel ,
dont start a war you cant finish,
No peace until we get what we own  No peace till we reclaim the right of the bloody souls,
I am a Christian I pray for the Christians on both sides And there are not many between them,
So Israel was given to the jew and then attacked and Israel won also taking more land in the process ,
Easy Israel wants land Britain gives land Arabs throw a hissy fit Israel somehow wins Arabs still in hissy fit,
That feel when someone walks into your house and tells you to get out And everyone says let them stay why cant you just be friends,
Wow this video is so not objective,
Lots of incorrect facts they did not expell the arabs from their homes most of the arabs left being certain the Arab countries will win the war Then when israel won the war you had a whole bunch of shocked arabs claiming the land that they left,
such a shame this misleading video got so many watchers you need to be careful and persist and if you dont know all the history dont publish this kind of videos on public you genius didnt mentioned those facts 1 the land of Cnaan was promised on the bible first to the Jewish ppl who already lived there long before The Ottoman Empire concurred the land  pls do not forget that the Jewish bible is the first was written among other religions books 2 the Sykes picot and the San Remo conference where the first and the only boundaries agreements that got statutory from the UN and it was before the UN Vote on the Partition Plan on Nov 29 1947 that never came across because of the Arab nationss attack and penetration to the Israeli territory right after 3 Read the Palestinian National Covenant and Hamass covenant before you judge Israel understand that although Israel demanded to cancel the Palestinian national covenant as part of the Oslo Accords and other accords and although the Palestinians leaders promised to do so they never changed or cancel it Yaser Arafat said right after the Oslo accord to all the Palestinian ppl and all the arab ppl on radio that the Oslo agreement is just one more step to fulfill the Palestinian national covenant and destroy the Jewish country 4 the green line boundaries never got permanent statutory it was just Temporary ceasefire borders so due to the British mandate Ramat Hgolan and Yehuda Veshomron are in the rightful boundaries of Israel look at Article 80 Chapter 12 of the Charter of the United Nations 5 if Israel give more lands like Yehuda Veshomron and Ramat Hagolan it will make Israel unlovable to Arab attacks 6 the Arabs started the 6 days war 7 Israel has the most humanitarian army in the world we dont kill citizens we kill terrorists who live all their life in one purpose and one purpose only destroy Israel and Jews to become shahids you cannot trust them and the history shows it repeatedly all the time and more and more,
The Bullied become the Bullies,
This video got my nerves at the max level Here this is israel A group of people who forced some arabs to give them their land and they got a part they went jealous and began to take more  Help im gonna get hate comments now but tbh LETS JUST HAVE PEACE but after 5mil innocents were killed Just plz stop saying muslims r terrorists they are just peace makers they never did the 9 1 1 incedent america just blamed islam for nothing u follow ur own religion ok but do u have the right to control other religions And what they should follow This is exactly what antimuslims do they give hate and hate to muslims but go ask them this question What do u know about islam They will answer nothing They only hated bec Their presidents are spreading awarness of dangers of islam Anyways this happened like 70 years ago The past is past lets start a new fresh page and call it peaceI respect all religions and May peace be spread ,
People around the world see arabic dialects and Islam and they see destruction Too late,

ISIS Israeli Secret Intelligence Service,
How did the palestinians get the West Bank back after Israel took it in 1967 6 days war,
Free memeistine,
If Palestine wants to be a country they need to forget about ruling the whole area and start to focus on what they do have Or theyll have nothing I dont blame Israel for trying to push them out At this point what else can they do to ensure their own safety,
Biased as video,
Well presented,
All problem there caused by hamas and Rightwing Israelis If both sides want peace it can be acheived by forming of one country with a secular constitution where every citizen have the same rights or there will wars for the next half cetury,
Still confused,
Seems to me they should go back to the original agreement Praying of peace ,
Just make it a secular government that is okay with both arabs and jews Or are both of these sides too devout to ever allow the others to live in peace,
TWO state SOLUTION,
If only the Palestinian Leadership had accepted the 1948 proposal they would have had their state way back then,
FINNALY a NEUTRAL MEDIA and it said the TRUTH,
Love to Isral,
From Paraguay we say Free Palestine Resistencia,
i ran several experiments on u tube here are results after returning to many comment sections months later  my comments are not all incisive or possibly always objective any more than the videos  yet after many months comments that are vapid or in support of any liberal message have thousands of likes mine usually and almost always zero statistically an impossibility  god help us from those responsible who think they know what is better for us all they are dictators with similar blood on their hands as those historical ones like pol pot hitler stalin mao amd more,
Greedy p,
Why everywhere the Britishers are involved,
Im sorry your video gives me vertigo Too much movement from a slide to slide,
city of panic,
I am 21 years old I have been introduced to childhood by parents about Palestine  so I really love Palestine greetings from Indonesia,

Thank you for being unbiased,
British Government supported Immigration that led to war over the land History repeats itself,
Down with Israel Free palestinia,
I want Israel to collapse and watch them die slowly begging for the mercy you didnt give us Israel made us start groups to take them down Love from Kuwait by a Palestinian,
Its so fun to read theese comments and replies man,
Well you started a war Palestine arab states and lost result Israel moved in and ever since Israel didnt back down Every country that loses a war loses land Its how it goes,
Egypt took sinai back israel didnt give it back easily and thats why al sadat was killed because he made peace with isreal after defeating them,
What are the song titles from this,
Homeless people given exception to extermination Palestinians and to create big homeless shelter called Israel,
does anybody know what the song at 220 is called,
Why doesnt this video mention that there was a previous plan to divide Palestine prior to 1947 where Arabs would get 80 of the territory but they rejected the offer,
Do people really understand when they calling someone terrorist,
America support PalestineNot all of us are trump the dump,
I can understand when people say the Arabs are the ones who attack first so can pretend that Israel wants peace But let me ask you this if someone broke into your house and just sat there you could understand how they just sat there But the person whose home it is would not sit still Its completely justified for the Arabs to respond with violence Even if they lost It may not have been smart on the Arabs part and may not be smart now as the Palestinian blood shed is much worse than the Israelis but it is completely justified It makes sense It was never your land,
how can we reach peace when even the comment section is on a raging war not all of them,
When you defend your land and fight occupation its not mentioned as terror,
When an entrance has twin doors But they keep one of them locked,
I hate how you have to pull to exit the bathroom,
Door Pull Me **Pushes** Bystander You Pull it Me Oh Yeah Because my next plan was to lift it from the bottom,
Interior doors open into the room youre accessing so randos in the hallway dont get a faceful of door Exterior doors open out so the entire door frame keeps the door shut against the wind as opposed to nothingthe handle,
Why cant doors just open both ways,
Our new museums facility had people scratching their heads in how to enter our building We couldnt understand it either since we had double doors signs that said which door to push no handles on one of the doors etc It wasnt until watching this video two weeks ago that it dawned on us to simply remove the handle from the outside push side and simply replace it with a brass plate No one has difficulties now Duh Why not one of our designers noticed this over our first year in the new building is beyond comprehension,
Down with doors Up with door beads You just walk right through them,
Other peopleWhen I grow up Im gonna be insert basic job MeWhen I grow up Im gonna design a better door,
I was banned from a supermarket once because I fell victim to their bad design In Germany you have to return used bottles to the supermarket So I went to this supermarket with a couple of bottles and there was a sign that indicated where to return them I walked there and there was a door that said fire safety door  must not be held open So I thought oh I guess I have to open it then So I opened it and there was the machine that said ready and accepted my bottles But then an employee of the supermarket stomped at me really angrily and banned me from the store because I was not supposed to open that door It was ridiculous because there was no way to know that so I asked to talk to the owner to clear things up but he agreed that I should be banned from the store and he was like what should we do add a sign to the door As if that would be something that was unthinkable Wow it still aggravates me today,
In the us most doors that are the entry and exit point for a room that has a capacity of more than 20 are to be pushed on exit and pulled on entry due to fire code There was an infamous fire in Chicago where a lot of people burned alive because the crowd mobbed the door which made it impossible to pull it open Since then this rule has been the standard I hardly ever get doors wrong no matter how poorly designed they are due to my knowledge of this so hopefully spreading the word will help some others too,
There is a law in Canada every doors in public spaces have to open toward outdoor for fire safety There were a case where everybody rushed to the door and it was impossible to open the door and almost everybody died,
That reminds me of a discussion I had with a carpenter He was replacing old plexiglas push plates with stainless ones The paint above the push plate wasworn out from people pushing there He told me You guys dont know how to open a door I told him he did not installed the plateson the correct height Next day they were all 20cm higher,
I love the video  looks like the door at Vox though was designed as a doubleswinging door  this is pretty common for frameless glass doors as putting a push plate on one side looks really ugly from the other side Then probably postinstallation the access control card swipe guys have come along and installed a magnetic clamp locking device at the top of the doors you can see this in the video making them only able to open inwards I see this happening all the time typically due to cost  systems which support doubleswinging doors are much more expensive and less reliable at locking compared to a magnetic clamp on a door that only swings one way,
They called the wrongly designed door after the designer who called upon improving them,
Bruh I thought it said Its not you Bad odors are everywhere,
Building code states all doors in a corridor must open into the room,
1800 we will have flying cars in the future 2016,
Door *becomes annoying* Norman Oh boy im gonna write a book about you damn door,
The Vox office designer disliked this video,
Ive walked into locked push doorsand trust me it hurts ,
when it looks like a push door *but its a slide door*,
*I hate Vox* Change my mind,
A solution comes directly from GTA My character always pushes doors open because the doors go both ways no signs needed no push plates or pull handles needed,
457 That killed me,
I do the same with a door that I pass through Glass doors are so confusing since they blend in with the rest of the glass windows,
So hows this guy meant to be credible when he comes here and cant use taps and light switches,
How about doors that just slide into the wall Save a good few feet of space,
stop putting handles on push doors And make bothroom doors push to exit so I dont have to grab the handle to exit,
U get irritated by doorsI get irritated be USB sticks,
When I first started watching I instantly started thinking of the movie Snatch where the robbers are trapped until the getaway driver pushes the door open from the other side Then they put the clip in at 454,
Feed back was the font as face Book,
On a bathroom door i have used before it has a handle and a flat plate on the front,
You know what should be a thing All bathroom doors should be able to be pushed open when you exit Doesnt matter if you have to pull it open to get into a bathroom but every god damn public bathroom door should be able to be pushed open You know why Because I hate touching a god damn nob or bar to pull open the door because quite a few of you dont wash your hands,
What if you had to pull out with no handle ,
Or there could just be a door with NO handle that swings BOTH ways,
American issue Blame the door not the user xD,
Lets just use the doggy doors *Problem solved*,
Im not a fan of doors since I cant reach the handle capybaraproblems,
Mistake in the book 148 symbol is after the dot,
Lmao Just Dont mess up its that simple,
Well you can call him *Professor Double Door*,
Solution Smash it down,
I call such things Designed by someone who doesnt have to use it And that door is still a Norman door they just added an instruction manual to it,
I see a series coming Things that tick me off lets fix it,
Ive got a crazy idea what if doors knew we were there and opened for us,
Or maybe just make a whole video about doors,
twin doors that each open in a different direction one push to open and the other one pull to open,
Lol I want to see a door with the handle next to the hinge,
Love stuff like this Thank you,
Doors are too good for this world Sure some have flaws but you try to do what a door does daytoday,
Ex girlfriend Its not you Its the door,
So when I yell this door is stupid Out loud Im a intellectual,
Hodor died because of Norman Doors,
Wish there was more examples,
Bad Doors Me *looks at my door* Door No one loves you Me ,
Once I saw a door which opens both side,
Most Doors open to the outside if your inside in case of a fire that you can just run out and not need to stop to open it an d hold it open,
Ive been in the glass business for forty years doing lots of doors For 39 years Ive tried to get customers to make the right decisions about their doors but they say No thats not what I want I want it to look a certain way I dont care if people have hard time Theyll eventually learn I had a lady who owned a multimillion dollar house on a cliff overlooking the ocean She actually said she wanted unsafe railings to save money and angrily assured me that Ill tell people not to lean on them People are stupid I want to buy this It wont do what you want it to do I dont care Sell it to me hey this doesnt do what I want it to do You ripped me off,
Lock and stock and 2 smoking barrels YES,
Vox media is the worst main stream media,
Don Norman is the father of the subject UX User Experience,
After years of research I have developed an algorithm everyone can use to avoid this problem 1 Approach door 2 Push  If something happens go to step 4 if nothing happens go to step 3 3 Pull  if nothing happens the door is locked 4 Open door 5 Walk through,
Why cant people use 2 way openning doors,
We should just make it vertical handles for pull horizontal for push,
Wow I just felt like my brain got bigger,
youre goddamned sic right,
What it should be high vertical bar  pull low horizontal bar  push And if the door doesnt do this PUT A SIGN,
Youre doing great stuff Vox Thanks,
while studying i had a course of Work Health and Safety and they taught us that every doors in any public places or work places should open outwards in case of fire or any emergency so people dont block opening if bigger crowd gathered Now i always fail to open doors at firs time cause this rule stuck in my head but noone using it,
Door push Me * pulls * Bystanders * laughing * Me WTF IS SO FUNNY ABOUT IT,
All doors should be pushed on your way out of the building This is for the simple reason that if there is some emergency and people panic they wont end up piled against the pull side of a door,
MIDVALE School for the Gifted,
I hate twin doors I know a lot of the time theyre for wheel chairs but places always keep one damn door locked I also hate handles on the push side of a door,
Omg snatch example yes Love the movie love the scene,
When in doubt HODOR Game of Thrones fans will surely get the joke ,
No its a pretty basic rule in commercialpublic buildings they are PUSH to get OUT because its a fire hazard to have to pull open a door when people are crowding against it in residential buildings you PULL to get OUT because you greet people in These are industry standards and seriously design 101,
I look at the top or specifically the frame to work out which way the door can physically go eg metal bit at the top prevents pulling so it must be a push But I get this aswell we shouldnt have to think about it,
HAHAHAHAHA THE WAY YOU JUST YOUR HAND AND THE CARDBOARD DOOR HAHAHA My mind saw it and said Ah yes pus OH OK,
The amount of times Ive embarrassed myself in public opening a door wrong,
My man went to San Diego to find out why doors dont pull or push,
Who else flew to san diago because they were irritated at a door in their office,
That is how you know they are running out of content,
Yeah Those damn doors deserve it time to make another crusade,
is the podcast on spotify,
Whats the podcast app used on the video,
I wonder how many hours I have wasted on bad doors,
The doors are like that because the government purposely make us annoyed so they can distract us from them actually being lizards *I hope you understand my sense of irony*,
Solution is simple every door should open towards inside Of course there might be exceptions and we can use design on these situations MAKEALLDOORSINSIDE,
Hahaha some door with Pull Bar and written Pull but people still Pushing it,
Sooooooo He titled a thing after himself In his own book That he wrote About his struggles badass og,
why do some toilet stall doors open inward like how am i supposed to leave if im literay stuck between the half open door and a toilet,
Just let doors turn twoway its more convenient,
They made a whole video about doors How dissapointing,
Youre goddamnn right Becky,
I love how you involved Roman Mars in this video the same way he involved people in his ted talk and presumably his show,
JUST MAKE A DOOR THAT OPENS BOTH WAYS,
This was very interesting Thanks for the video,
Vox always covering the important pressing issues,
Wow such a new thing to realize for a design student like me thankyou,
Why not make a door that doesnt make you forget why you entered the god damn room,
I dont know who this Norman guy isbut I like him,
Should have included the opening scene in Tommy boy where he tries to get in the college,
All prison bars are replaced with push doors that dont have a handle that you need to pull to get out,
They have double doors in Costa coffee but one is always locked and I always opened the locked one I hated it so much it actually put me off going there,
Youtubes Norman Door is the space bar to pause the video rather than move the page down,

in china its just push or pull One word in a box next to the handle EZPZ,
The Design of Everyday Things is my favorite book I still have from college,

Why dont you just make em go both ways,
Why cant folks from UK install normal light switches from Europe,
It should be simple  horizontal for push vertical for pull One exception flat push plates,
the doors with the big stretched horizontally button sometimes u have to pull,
Normon just described me Discovering,
The signal Ive always understood is horizontal bar for push vertical bar for pull,
Heres a generaluse protip for you all Exterior doors on *public* buildings are supposed to open *outward*  This is due to fire code This code is not applied to residential houses which are allowed to swing inward and most do,
Ok So far I was thinking that I am the single person in the world facing this PullPush problem No we have a dedicated video for it,
Man  When I see these type of videos  I feel like I am Albert Einstein,
Is it me or does normann sound like jason nash,
Why not make the door swing both ways,
They should make it wear you can push and pull a door both ways,
U always gotta pull getting into somewhere,
Sees pull door Pushed door WTF WTF,
All doors should open horizontal automatically so its in nobodys way If you ever played Zelda you know those are the best doors,
I always thought they were like that so you could put a bar or a chain through the handles to keep it secure in case of emergency or whatnot,
How do you latch a door with a metal plate This is yet another example of someone who isnt an architect outlining a design that works in ideally but not practically,
WHO THE HELL OWN THAT VOICE that narrator soooooo deep I like,
This is Fing amazing and I want to know more about it  thanks great vid 3,
I literally saw a push door with a pull handle This doesnt make sense,
Bad doors but also bad handles and fitting My kitchen doorknob is fitted too close to the frame everytime I close it I scuff the skin off my knuckles ergonomic it is not,
Showexplain the new design And will surely check out the podcast ,
the horizontal grips should be push and the vertical ones pull,
Make the push side have a flat wide bar and the pull side have the handle,
Dor norman Dormamu DORMAMU IVE COME TO BARGAIN,
This video reminds me of Little Big Planet  now I miss the old days TT,
The ONLY plus point I can give your nightmare door over a flat panel one isin case of emergency you could somehow barracade yourself in,
Thats why when you go up to the door you first pull with your fingers to see if its push and if it isnt push but in a slick fast past way you kno,

The best video Your god damn right Becky,
It is YOU Modern urban life is way nicer smelling than urban life 100 200 300 400 500 1000 years ago Plumbing central air deodorant laundry machine etc,
I think thus video is incorrect because it doesnt consider the fact that if you wear a hat you can open any door,
I love you Vox,
I have a math test tomorrow but feel like this is more important,
We dont even need doors If for security use LASERS,
Great guy his neck seemed like balls tho,
Great video but why so much cursing,
Watching this in 2018 Your videos are amazing I smile at your creative ideas,
030 what podcast app is that,
These things doors have been around for thousands of years and they have had basically zero innovation ever since then,
I think that pull sign should be on the other side of the handle,
Youre right becky youre goddamn right,
You look a lot like a brazilian actor called Gulherme Briggs,
456508 Snatch What no layer cake or lock stock and two smoking barrels,
*cant use door* god dammit *writes book*,
Youre goddamn right Becky,
there was a time when I tried to pull then push a doorI thought it was locked until someone slide it open,
For Portuguese people this is quite critical Puxar means the opposite of Push it really means pull and its pronounced similarly,
This is 300 worse in Germany Be thankful,
Just watched snatchstill laughedLol,
I like these collab videos between Vox and 99 Invisible Keep making more,
The push sign could be way bigger or just remove the entire door,
Glass doors like the one at the start of the video are supposed to go both ways They usually do,
When your country adds button pressed doors to the mix and some of the buttons blend to the wall,
My old school had doors which had one side flat one side with a handle doors with handles on both sides doors with push bars and handles and doors with 2 flat sides which open both ways Great great design,
Next on the list Why cant Jazz players just play the right note,

Bath and Body works fragrance refills gotta twist them left to open instead of the usual right lol,
Lmfao i never realized the door to the bookies in Snatch was pull door makes that scene twice as good as it already was,
328 Anyone know where I can get one of these Or its name,
I once walked face first into a door at my highschool because i thought it was push If every door in the building has handles on both sides you start just walking into them,
EVERY glass door in my current workplace has that same problem About half the doors are glass doors We have issues,
Snatch,
the man gets frustrated writes a book just wow,
Its like they had one job and they blew it,
This video introduced me to 99pi and I just wanted to thank you Love Roman and the whole team in beautiful downtown Oakland California 3,

A 5 minute and 32 second vox video criticizing doors nice,
Doormammu Ive come to complain about your design,
Ive watched this like five times Its one of my alltime favorite videos Great subject great job,
First vox video ever watched,
OK I can finally answer Unlike the US Switzerland for example has regulation on doors the regulation being that doors MUST open towards the closest evacuation route unless the room the door leads to is for example an office with less than 20 people using said room The office door is most probably push because having a door block a hallway is annoying In the case of the initial door that feels wrong shown in the video it looks like some sort of larger room behind that door a room that can easily fit 20 people I would need confirmation on the nature of the space and I would assume that evacuation routes are via the hallway so the door is opening in the wrong direction,
Tube master develop emission miracle toe no shoulder American particular,
The worst is double doors where one of them is randomly locked So many restaurants I go into have double doors where you would normally go through the one on your right relative to the direction youre going However for some inexplicable reason they have left one side locked So you have to go in or out the wrong door Sometimes the same restaurant will even switch which door is left locked,
I got more shocked just seeing the vox media office for the first time,
lowkey trhowing shade at vox headquarters for a bad door,
We need doors that work like in GTA V Just run into them and it flings open,
Welcome to Finland here all doors open towards the building exit So if you enter a building and go deeper in it you always pull the door and vice versa Im not sure if there is some kind of regulations behind this most likely,
I love you bake,
Heres a way to fix this Make every door open BOTH ways Or make the world like Star Trek and have all the doors be automatic Also you could probably change that doors handle in the Vox building to a push plate in 30 minutes So do it,
Does anyone think the prof sounds like Hank Pym,
Are we gonna ignore the fact that guy at the start looks like Filthy Frank ,
Such a good video,
Yeah but flat panels are ugly,
first world problems,
How did they not explain the basic reason Push get into bigopen space Pull get into smallclosed space It is meant to avoid being crushed to death when you want to leave a room during mass panic,
I think everyone can agree that the MacBook chargers are among the best things Apple have designed,
Make it so the door can open either way At my school a kid went to the hospital because the glass door smashed when he tried to open it Since then they have started marketing doors that can swing either way,
I Like how he is confident enough thats hes sure the security door wont open,
the scene from the movie Snatch was a perfect example,
I just realised they do it in their office so fingerprints dont get on the door,
soooo glad im not the only one who gets frustrated with doors,
Why not use a curtain of beads instead lol,
i always look for the bumper on the floor,
It wont open because its a security door *one of his buddies come in* What the f7 are you two doing Honestly thats everyone these days,
Or yknow you could make most doors go BOTH WAYS,
To be fair I hate those door designs too However there is a tiny bit of logic around why they have the design Youll notice its only on glass doors The thought is that there will be a significantly reduced chance of people getting fingerprints all over the glass line they do when its a flat bar I cant say it works exactly as intended but,
I knew the verge and vox are from the same company but I didnt know they worked in the exact same building,
I like how at 050 they use recycled footage of Trumps private jet XD,
Vertical  pull Horizontal  push,
The best door is ur gfs backdoor,
You have a HANDLE to PUSH,
I think i might start keeping some post its in my pocket just to be able to post Use Caution Norman Door on these doors Im sure not many people know what it is but if theyre curious theyll learn something,
I wish this level of critical thought was put towards your gunpolitical videos,
Theres fire codes and security to contend with But most importantly remember that that building was built by the cheapest bidder,
Tbh the opening scene make me thought its an half assed created video Turns out to be pretty good,
that guys voice made my subwoofer shake my house apart,
I dont experience this problem Doors in my nation go both ways,
In Portuguese push sounds like puxe that means pull Travelling is confusing sometimes,
Oh yeah yeah,
Omg I reas it as odors I was so confused for the first 30 seconds,
*THESE ARE THE REAL PROBLEMS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON*,
But did they ever fix the door in the office,
*What if we just lift them up and down sort of like a garage door*,
Tldr Vertical handle  pull horizontal handle  push,
Ive seen doors with push or pull but can swing both ways anyway,
water taps are my biggest enemy sometime I cant decide wether to push it pull it up spin it to left or right or it has censor so I just need to put my hands sometime I get confused too on how to shut it down weirdest one Ive ever see is the one that u need to click a little invisible button behind the tap to make the water flows sometime Im just over confident and ended up smashed my head on the door too oh yeah I remember I broke a weird air conditioner button on the wall at a hotel because I have no idea how to use it I ended up letting the air conditioner on for 3 days hahaha,
What if a door opened only one way and had no handles,
Im reading his book right NOW oh my god this is hilarious,
The doors are also for a bit of security imagine a thief robber whatever trying to escape then tries to ram through the door instead of escaping he gets knocked unconcious,
One of the greatest trolls of our time,
how would we close door from outside when it has no handle,
my school has a flat plate on a pull door,
I find it should just be vertical pull horizontal push You can wager in car doors and push panels but from Ive seen in humanenvironment interaction that simple perpendicular decision works really well,
The magic store near my house has a two way door with a PULSH sign on it Lol,
Wait what is wrong with light switches in the UK,
Heres a stupid story These doors that push when it says pull are like practically everywhereso one day i saw a door with push i decided to pull itand nopeit *was* push_,
When you want to go in somewere you push and when you want to go out you pull  this is how we made the doors at my house,
Youre right Becky Youre good damn right,
As an interior architect it mostly has to do with ADA or buidling codes its just the way it is The building does not approved,
In Newfoundland Canada there was once a fire at a big dance the K of C fire Everybody at the fire rushed to the exit but the doors opened inwards and with the crowds of panicking people there was no room to open the doors and everyone died Ever since then doors in Newfoundland were designed to open outwards for ease of escape during an emergency and most Newfoundlanders have a sense that thats the direction to open a door,
Why put those metal plates for push and handles for pull,
everytime before I touch Norman doors I always have this weird feeling of like a life of death fate Either do it right or get embarrassed publicly and remember it for years,
applies to Microwaves every microwave has a different interface  WHYYYYYYY,
It is always confusing when they write Push or Pull on a glass door because you can read the word from both sides,
In my opinion doors should be always made to escape from building So if building is on fire you run by closest escape path you always push just in banks make it otherwise due to security,
OMG MY SCHOOL HAS FOUR FRONT DOORS BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVER UNLOCKED AND I SWEAR THEY SWITCH IT JUST TO CONFUSE USSSS,
Rubber flaps like at meat sections,
once accidently i hit the door so badly and its cracked security took me to managers office but i blamed their door manager just laughed at me and let me go,
A door like that should obviously move both ways,
If you are going inside the door should be pulled if you are going outside the door should be pushed I believe that is a fire safety measurement,
wow  i read his book o the new updated version,
This isnt even to mention accessibility for people with physical disabilities,
doors should always be pushing inside the room heres why 1 so that when you exit you dont have to walk two feet forward then go in the opposite direction 2 there are always more people outside the room and most of the time pushing is easier 3 so it doesnt hit somebody closely walking by the room 4 pushing inside sounds way more sexual,
Ive noticed pull handles on push doors everywhere in NYC Thousands like the second door they show after the Vox office doors The long handle that goes across the breadth of the door indicated I need to pull it open Nope Its that way on both sides Then youve got the businesses that have double doors and always keep the right one locked Its a damned conspiracy of dolts I tell ya,
lve never seen a bad door l think doors here in brazil are really well standardized lve never even thought about this topic,
Why not just make them always push doors on either side,
Theyre everywhere in America not everywhere We just have such terrible work standards that we think Alright something that opens and closes is there but who cares if its in the most efficient or intuitive manner Japan has sliding doors that stay closed until you touch them Figure it out America,
I agree with this video because it happened to me sometimes bad doors need to Change please,
Worst door of all you pushed to go in used the toilet washed your hands and now to go out YOU GRAB AND PULL THE HANDLE ALL THE UWASHED HANDS PULLED Best door you go in and out touching nothing,
In the 80s we talked about year 2000 having flying cars weird Science make your own girlfriend space travelreality 2019 Bad doors,
If its push it should be flat and a handle is pull Easy,
I want to create a door that switches which way it opens every time it closes,
How can this be a big deal Why cannot these dimwits put a sign on doors telling how to open them,
How about *No Door*,
Not to mention bad Windows Not user friendly at all Talk about discoverability,
SOLUTION LEARN DESIGN FOR FUN AND PROFIT AND UTILITY,
Youve probably spent more time watching this video than having difficulty with doors your whole life,
Cannot believe they paid you to make this,
he has balls growing behind his beard D what a man,
Vox making realize minor life inconveniences i never thought of before,
We could just have Star Trek doors where they instantly slide open  screw security I want to open my door,
Maternity room door push push push,
So the guy all about intuitive use works for Apple with the least intuitive technology ever Buttons are fine Apple knowing how to get where youre going is more important than looking cool while doing it,
All public restroom doors should open outward That way when you leave after washing your hands you can just push the door open with your arm or side instead of grabbing the fecalcontaminated handle to pull open the door,
The ideal is two way doors,

v t e American South in the War of 1812 show v t e Naval battles of the War of 1812 The War of 1812 18121815 was a conflict fought between the United States the United Kingdom and their respective allies Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars in the United States and Canada it is seen as a war in its own right Since the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France which the United States contested as illegal under international law To man the blockade Britain impressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy Incidents such as the ChesapeakeLeopard affair inflamed antiBritish sentiment In 1811 the British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in which 11 British sailors died1415 The British supplied Indians who conducted raids on American settlers on the frontier which hindered American expansion and also provoked resentment16 Historians remain divided on whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America contributed to the American decision to go to war On June 18 1812 United States President James Madison after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress signed the American declaration of war into law17 With the majority of their army in Europe fighting Napoleon the British adopted a defensive strategy American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity especially in New England where it was derogatorily referred to as Mr Madisons War American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada improving British morale American attempts to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal also failed In 1813 at the Battle of Lake Erie the Americans won control of Lake Erie and at the Battle of the Thames defeated Tecumsehs Confederacy securing a primary war goal At sea the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will In 1814 one of these raids burned the capital Washington although the Americans subsequently repulsed British attempts to invade New England and capture Baltimore At home the British faced mounting opposition to wartime taxation and demands to reopen trade with America With the abdication of Napoleon the blockade of France ended and the British ceased impressment rendering the issue of the impressment of American sailors moot The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast annihilating American maritime trade and bringing the United States government near to bankruptcy Peace negotiations began in August 1814 and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24 as neither side wanted to continue fighting News of the peace did not reach America for some time Unaware that the treaty had been signed British forces invaded Louisiana and were defeated at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 These late victories were viewed by Americans as having restored national honour leading to the collapse of antiwar sentiment and the beginning of the Era of Good Feelings a period of national unity News of the treaty arrived shortly thereafter halting military operations The treaty was unanimously ratified by the United States on February 17 1815 ending the war with status quo ante bellum no boundary changes,
He worked at Apple obviously he knows design,
Sometimes Vox makes some good videos,
Just remove the handle on the push side Door fixed  Youre welcome,
We all need to think like Beccy,
Youre right Becky Youre god damned right,
The end scene XD,
Make em allways open outwards much harder to get in,
This is possibly the least pressing problem Ive seen in 2016 Well done Vox,
Dam bro you nearly ripped the door off,
Well thank you for a good refeance,
To me its always going inside  pull going outside  push And most of the time it works that way so when there is an emergency you can easily get out,
what about a push door with a handle for emergencies what if you need to shut the door quickly in the event of an emergency ie intruder,
As German the shown Door had irritated me too Because mostly in Germany all Doors are designed to or even HAVE to be designed to in certain areas open in the direction of escape  so this door would normally open to the floorside as this is the route to escape in emergency This has many reasons like preventing people getting trampled to death when a mass panic occurs and you just run away steered mostly by your instincts But mostly Doors like this open to both sides,
The mall door i almost always go to has a vertical handle you would assume you pull a sign that SAYS PULL and yet you can only push it and its been like that ever since i can remember,
The worst part is the guy lost his ice cream twice,
That explains why the fat guy was eating icecream in the middle of nowhere,
That stupid background music was really unnecessary,
Didnt an alien ship make more sense anyway,
Its funny how people think 911 changed the world and forgotten about the nuke on Japan that destroyed half of it,
Terrorists made Disneys CG artists to do overnight work,
Pleakley Uh Jumba we missed the truck Jumba were not aiming for the truck,
the final cut is alot better anyway a jumbo jet wouldnt be very good for chasing a spaceship,
Its crazy how much a national tragedy can impact our perspective on certain things even animated cartoon movies with scenes like these felt wrong after 911,
Did anyone else feel like the music was Unnecessary,
How on earth do youget the unreleased footage,
I cant hear over this sad depressing music,
I prefer the island version it suits the movie way better,
Really interesting to see the two versions and cut scenes Wish that background music wasnt so loud so I could hear the dialogue better tho,
Americas logic in tragedies Slavery get over it Trail of Tears get over it Imperialism get over it Pearl Harbor get over it 911 Never forget,
Damn the airplane seen was more epic,
FINE YOUTUBE ILL WATCH IT ALREADY,
There was that one part where Lilo said there were no cities on their island,
this is sad im sad,
All I got from this is that they really hated the ice cream guy,
That poor ice cream man,
Ningn espaol al que el nombre de el youtuber le parece un poco conocido,
My life is a lie Who knows how much theyve covered up Up is down left is right the universe is guy named John,
Poor slushy guy You can alter reality but you can never save the slushy,
The unreleased cut seems more entertaining,
Using a building as a ramp and avcelerator was so cool,
Now why would disney put a plane flying thru a city who did this FBI OPEN UP,
Imaging this movie was released the same day,
I never even knew that it was suppose to be a plane instead of a spaceship and Ive watched Lilo and Stitch tons of times Look at that I learned something,
Gupota zajebista bajk zmieni bo nie wiem coo to tylko bajka,
Good call on Disneys part I also think it made the scene more fun to watch regardless of the backstory,
Some people thing it could be the mandela effect you would get more view is your advertise as the Mandela effect,
Omg did you guy really need to put that sad music,
i think the new version is much better it keeps giving Lilostitch that Hawaii paradise feeling that it always had ,
This is the only time a change like this makes sense to me,
The background music gave the whole video a creepy but sad vibe lmao,
YOOOOOOOO I KNEW I WASNT CRAZY I KNEW I SEEN IT BEFORE,
Why i am watching this I honestly dont care,
To be honest the theatrical release gave that scene more character to the film,
How did you get that footage Is it on the bonus features,
VOX es un partido poltico espaol ajjaja,
I look at this as more of a foreshadow They new what was going to happen smh,
Lol nowadays people keep saying that terroist word lol idk what it is pronounced but its like ala hakbarr,
Now we cant have any plane and city scene anymore ,
Glad they took out the city because lilo says there are no major citys,
Its almost like Disney knew,
I thought they meant 911 emergency,
Thanks for putting those arrows in the thumbnail I was having a hard time finding the giant spaceships,
Holy shiayte I didnt know this,
*YOU GOT A HOLE IN YOUR RHIGT WING*,
Oh Lindsay Ellis is making vids for VOX now Why am I not surprised ,
Whats the song in the background,
The theatrical cut makes sence aliens wouldnt know how to drive earth planes,
I find it interesting that they put this in the film before it happened Almost prophetic,
Well at least Disney knew that we would be senitive towards this coming out,
The alien ship looks better than a plane,
Lilo were not aiming for the truck,
When you dont even think about 911 the original scene was still pretty gruesome with the plane wheels ripping art the buildings exterior,
Thanks for the sad background music vox otherwise how was I supposed to know that 911 was a sad event,
So the Simpsons are savages,
Atleast the remake is better imo alien style plane fits so much better to this movie,
Disney wasnt aiming for the truck,
I disagree that it is time to stop mourning 911 Many tragedies are mourned for decades afterwards as a sign of respect and to remind us of what caused them What needs to be stopped is using 911 as incentive to send soldiers into the Middle East for whatever reason politicians say When they bring it up at rallies it is not to mourn but to garner votes The deaths started on September 11th 2001 and they carry on to this day,
I remember seeing the before version in around 200506,
The real reason why they changed it was because the guy losing his ice cream was to violent They forgot to not make another,
this is kinda sad,
Director damn it did you see what happened in New York this morning Editor say no more,
This is scary to watch,
Wow disney predicted Mario Kart 8,
I think it was kind of Disney to do this,
I had no idea about this wow,
Interesting A relative of mine who works for Disney told me about this when I was a kid Its interesting to actually see the original scene for the first time,
Can yall fix my amp,
I didnt know about this this was very informative and interesting,
Disregarding 911 Id still want it cut partially because thats not how planes move and even though Jumbas a genius I doubt he would know how to fly a plane better than a space ship,
I need to watch the unreleased version just to know how they got the plane in the first place,
None of these guys in the comments section have the brains to realize that this was predictive programming at the time,
Looks a lot better in alien,
Wouldve rather had the original version,
Also changed one piece,
The whole scene in the uncut version with the plane flying near the city buildings felt very uncanny No wonder why it was cut,
You can afford to use the uninterrupted audio The music is unnecessary and unwanted,
Not sure if this is my initail fear of planes and plane crashes talking but the original version looks ALOT more unnerving to me despite it being a cartoon I dont know of its because of how huge the plane is compared to the town or how close it is touching the ground as its zooming around but it honestly looks alot more terrifying Im glad they redid the scene,
This made the suckstobeyou fate of the ice cream guy much sharper Not even in an isolated valley is his ice cream safe,
I actually like the 2002 clip more,
Interesting,
911 was an inside job just google tower 7,
Lets just forget the negative on what America did and remember the sad that has happened in America,
Soy el nico que viene por vox,
Obnoxious music,
711 was a part time job,
i love how they changed it cause guys it has BIG impact to other and specially to those people whom their loved ones died there rip respect to those people neverforget,
In my opinion I wouldnt have changed the scene 911 just so happened to have taken place along the same time the movie was being producedreleased,
They could put it back enough time has passed I believe And its not like they crash into a building I mean when it gets shown on TV,
The real person who was hurt was the ice cream he got hit with a plane twice,
music  song  Carter William Leo Paul Divide By One please like for those who search the music,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki HEY HEY IM OVER HERE I TOO CHANGED THE WORLD HEY,
The nine eleven is the best general Aladin from Guadya xD,
Wow I had no idea But its good that Disney realized the situation and changed it to save one of the best movies theyve created,
Because im into 747s the old one would have been sick,
I wonder what wouldve happened had it been released as the official version,
This is some scary stuff,
The city idea was neat,
Rest In Peace the twin towers and the budget for the unreleased cut,
Must have been hell to reanimate,
Anyone else prefer the unreleased cut,
How can I get the uncut version,
I remember him saying its show time,
The smart thing to do tho,
What a bunch of babies Americans are Disney shouldnt of have to change this movie just cause of a disaster,
Its weird to think 911 even affected my favorite movie I wouldnt be surprised if 911 has the record for an event causing the most censorship of media edit it probably only has the record for most censorship in america that is,
I think the sombering music was unnecessary,
01042019 0107 Sombre trs sombre,
044 I see that building with the curved windows everytime I go to Waikiki,
Haters will say the first one was fan made,
Thats just *plane wrong*,
So did they prevent the next 911 attacks by doing this I dont get it,
That was dope asf tho they should of kept it,
Ok but i dont really care so why am i even watching this,
Lol I got 9 in the first math exam and the second exam i got 11,
Just imagine if Lilo  Stitch came out in June 2001 instead and this scene was kept in then 3 months later,
I prefer the released one anyway,
It doesnt help when you put depressing music in the background,
I feel sorry for the animators they had to remake the whole scene again,
Jookiba did 911,
It wouldve been fun watching a 747,
The music in the background was horrible,
Breaks my heart,
Just crazythis coincidence,
So 911 is cannon in the Disney Universe,
Unless jumba steals a 747 its not very sound logic for what an alien would drive to earth,
Cant believe I missed out an amazing Plikely scene,
Imagine beast original car before 911,
Its like seeing a fictional Hawaiian Atlantis that once existed left before it became nothing but a tiny town and lots of greenery and landscapes ,
This is simply true they changed the scene into jumbo jet instead of Jumbas starship,
In these kind of videos the music just make it a lot more creepy,
The music overly is really distracting,
Who here is with me on 91118 today RIP,
Not such a bad idea to change it My dad died the same year Simbas dad died and that was a coincidentally excessive amount of amplification for a tiny kid in a theater Lol now I want to know who in their right mind took me to see that film In other words theres not need to change everything but a little sympathy can go a long way when the tragedy is national and not just personal Kudos to disney,
That was a klm 747 in September 2001 unreleased cut,
Good thing they changed it because the worlds people would have thought Disney was responsible for 911 In fact I myself would have thought that Lilo  Stitch was soley reponsible for 911 themselves,
I did not know that 747city scene was in the original cut of Lilo and Stitch,
Well the alien ship looks waayy cooler than the plane in my opinion,
044 dont you hate it when a plane steals your ice cream Like if you agree,
Waitaminnit theyre in Honolulu Was the movie originally supposed be in Honolulu or did they fly there in an alternate scene that was never shown Because according to the actual movie Lilo lives in Kauai,
When a popular Youtuber like Justin Y or John Lemon comment on a video People be like oMG i SeE yOu EVrYwHerE,
I love the spaceship more tbh,
Apart for the 911 rectifications I think an alien aircraft better suited the scene anyways Btw no matter what the guy still lost his ice cream,
Hotel Trivago,
Just sad to see all those disrespectfull comments May all the victims of this tragic event rest in peace,
These criminals have no idea what a pain it mustve been to animate all of this,
yeah i could see why theyd need to change this,
One thing is for sure *they REALLY didnt want that guy to have ice cream *,
This is definite proof that Lilo and Stitch did 711,
Thats interesting thanks for making this,
damn yall got lindsay ellis making these noted,
Wait I have a question So if 911 havent happened lilo  stitch wouldnt be set in the hawaii islands *that would besad*,
Huh Neet,
This give me creepypasta vibes,
911 versiol was lir,
I thought Hawaii didnt have big cities in that movie according to Lilo,
Holy I never knew,
110 I did that stunt in the Crew 2 clip on the left,
Investigate 711,
Allahu Kingdom Hearts,
The meme potential if this was unchanged,
Why would they make it a 747 I think an alien ship is much better,
103 not the actual controls 106 where is the tilted gear,
interesting video but the background music is whay too loud,
The beginning days of political correctness and the uprising of the I am offended brigade,
The original was so much better,
Hmmmm,
I couldnt hear anything over the background music,
Lol at the serious music,
i knew something was different,
This was kinda sad,
Top 10 anime changes,
I think it works better in the 2002 version,
Jesus man,
I would l have appreciated to see a city but the island was still good,
The unreleased cut is actually released I have the VHS version of it and remember watching it,
So basically lilo and stitch predicted 911,
The super sad music in the background of made it hard to watch,
Never forgetti moms spaghetti,
I understand why they did this but I think it made more sence that they use their spaceship to save Lilo To quote jumba What Did you think we walked here,
Dam it bruh I was waiting for the crash of the twin towers,
This song is so depressing,
idk watching a scene in a 747 wouldve been pretty sick,
*Poor guy*,
Wow Talk about bad timing They saved the movie with these changes,
I thought this was a joke at first,
Everyone here is commenting about the video but here I am thinking about the butterfly effect of this change,
Good video but I hate the music put over top,
That background music was dumb and loud so theres a dislike from me,
Not gonna lie the re release version makes more sense due to the movie involving aliens an alien ship just seems way more practical,
Music name,
Rip to the animation team lmao,
Disney this scene will be Perfect When 911 was Born Disney oh Well this is sucks Animators of Disney dammit,
Finally the reason behind 911 comes out The US government staged 911 to piss off Disney and delay the release of lilo  stitch just for the lols,
I remember the ice cream guy lol,
Good on them for taking action tho,
YOOOOO Thats insane O_O,
Is a physical unreleasedcopy available This needs archiving,
lmao there were no planes dont answer,
Tbh the original scene was way cooler,
I dont understand why we went through so many changes to eliminate scenes with planes flying close to building or images with the twin towers in them I do feel like changing the plane to a space ship makes more sense but not changing the city to a mountain area I feel like a lot of effort was made to forget what happened and I get that but in some cases I think its unnecessary to make such big changes,
damn disney woke AF,
Keep in mind the movie was released only 9 months after 911 People would still have vivid memories of the tragedy,
I can see why this way changed,
Damn you Bush,
Didnt even know happened,
This doesnt make any sense They had to have taken the spaceship to get to earth in the first place When did 747s become space capable,
How many pieces were in the four piece luggage set,

041 top 10 saddest anime scenes,
I love that in both cuts the fat bald guy loses his ice cream,
I liked the old one honestly it had more the scene rather than them just flying around,
dancingisraelis dancingisraelis dancingisraelis dancingisraelis dancingisraelis dancingisraelis dancingisraelis,
When you install a lot of mod in San Andreas y,
Fun fact they even changed the name of the movie It originally was going to be called Larry  Silverstein,
Damn this is pretty heavy stuff Never thought Id say that about Disney ,
Right like disnei didnt know about it before,
The Cold War affects everything,
they definitely had to know something before hand in order to make something like that,
2002 version looks better tbh,
The unreleased cut was pretty sick,
Hey atleast the changes made those scenes even cooler,
I remember seeing the original version,
I love the serious music,
Spiderman was changed too The pre 911 promo had a helicopter getting caught in a big web between the twin towers,
My mans ice cream still got RIPed in both ones,
Europeans just laugh about it,
I actually cant tell if this is just really good editing or not,
This would be understandable I mean it would remind people of that terrible day Well atleast one thing stayed the same The poot man who always looses his ice cream,
VOX GIVE US THE MUSIC,
Wow just wow This is sad depressing and has lot of lour behind it,
Honestly the original was better and they should release an extended version of the film with the deleted scenes added back in,
but I love the 747 ,
Clickbait,
Take away the memory of Sept 11th and that actually would have been a better scene imo We had Con Air,
so jumbas ship was a airplane Hes an alien lol,
Hey vox can you stop spamming copyright claims,
Yeah that scene wouldve ended badly lol still cooler tho like they literally drifted a jumbo jet,
Rip ice ram man,
WHATS WITH THE SAD MUSIC,
I Will cut the unrealesed part and add it to my DVD Because only for a plane in a building They change itCities are more badass than mountains,
Lets see boeing 747400 I think anyway and if your bank angle is that much youre screwed,
Is it possible that they knew about 911 before us,
What is with the music,
Box actually doing something good,
Dude the original looks badass,

911 whats your emergency,
*D I S N E Y D I D 9  1 1*,
fricking 911 always changing things,
Ok but whats with the music,
I knew I saw that bald guy from somewhere and didnt imagine it Hahaha,
The original scene was way better imo,
Its always nice to see how human engineering and technology actually compete with advanced aliens,
Lilo  Osama,
I like the fact that they changed it to be honest,
the music makes me so sad,
Why the music I think Ill be better if it was just audio,
RIP ice cream 045,
We shouldnt just get over it but also we dont need to never forget either Its American history but trying to keep it always fresh in your mind is just giving people the ability to let fear rule their lives You have to be able to overcome tragedy and media shouldnt allow you to dismay that Be strong and optimistic It happened but we made it and here we are Its time to let the past go like every other tragedy weve done so Now Its 911s time,
Why is the plane one so creepy,
Id have never known that Fascinating,
Thats a win for terrorism in my book,
The changed version is much better and makes more sense,
The guy losing his ice cream along with the sad music made me cry,
Guys we gotta change it but keep the ice cream guy,
Man they should have just released the funny one,
Permission to land oVEr,
Would help if you could hear anything over the top of the music,
Im actually glad they changed the airliner to an alien ship That spacecraft is awesome and has been an iconic asset in the series since It makes since too because it completely explains how Jumba and Pleakely got to earth in the first place,
911 is my favorite holiday,
why is the music louder than the background,
Asked my uncles friend whi worked on it he said he felt bad making it,
I do too cool cartoons,
I can Imagine the long nights it took to redo that scene Thanks Osama,
WTF only the sky and sea did not change,
Music,
Imagine the conspiracy theorists if the first version was released slightly before 911,
Seriously some people need to get a life,
Not gonna lie the ship does look pretty cool,
045 rip 20012001,
There was nothing bad about that scene wdf,
This this is sad,
Lilo  Stitch Unleashered Cut September 2001 DVD Walt Disney Home Entertainment English SDH,
Whats with the sad music playing over it,
The unreleased one is the only one I saw till I was 8,
I do prefer the theatrical release of this as it does capture a better image of Hawaii then the precut version Plus for them to use their own spaceship would make perfect sense because how the hell would they acquire a thing as quickly as they did in the movie but that is not whats grinding my gears Lets just say it has a lot more to do what politicians and anyone technically under their payroll want you to forget most of the time,
Not gonna lie though The original cut is fun too and a little more creative and funny Its good to know that the directors were sensitive and didnt want to upset people but its also a shame that this perfectly fine animation had to go to waste,
Bush kills 3000 people Also bush oopsies Proceeds to kill 3 million people,
Yeah we all know how several movies depict the twin towers being hit by a plane and how Hollywood is just another subsidiary of the government,
One questionHow did they get a jumbo jet in the first place,

I aint even watched this but i can tell its so twisted by this bollocks channel ITS SO BIASED,
Turkey another conservative power rising Great Goodbye democracy,
They treat it like Erdogan is destroying Turkish democracy Nothing is democratic about a military that overthrows elected leaders periodically based on the whims of a longdead dictator What is democratic that the military couldnt depose him because the people took action to stop them Thats the will of he people in action Im not here to say I support Erdogan or all his changes but democratic doesnt mean westernized It means following the will of the people for better or worse,

306 I cant take anything you say seriously because of this Ressep,
Mistakes AKP didnt intend to help the religious oppressed by secularism always They became antisecular in late 2000s Before that Erdogan looked pretty liberal he even said he was pro LGBT rights The coup was not a secular coup it was staged by another religious group The Kemalist leaders of the army were purged in an investigation called Ergenekon years before the coup The army havent been Kemalists since then The Kemalists were replaced by FETO members a very large islamist group which allegedly staged the coup The referendum was rigged The electoral council started counting unofficial ballots midcount and a Turkish news agency started releasing official YesNo percentages way before the electoral council did no one really knows how they got the numbers before electoral council released them The count was live too so electoral council knew about this agency releasing its numbers and they let them There are a lot of speculations about this While it wasnt really a mistake its important to note that Ataturk was also a democratically selected dictator So its not like the Turkish people were all islamists and Ataturk tried forcing his ideas upon them And also most of his laws were democratically created in fact he only used his dictator powers in the war of independence Ban on headscarves wasnt done by Ataturk was done in the 90s and also it wasnt a total ban Only from government institutions,
The narrator quoted the coup almost workedHe mentioned nothing about the loss of life and property at that time,

Vox media controlled by western bastered world is not worried about Turkey but worried about bastered westeren  Erdogan is a good person i like him,
Love Turkey from nuclear power Pakistan  ,
Main things that need to be corrected in the video according to me are 1 Ataturk had somewhat dictatorialish powers as the founder plus he had almost full support of the citizens as the war hero But he didnt want to be a dictator as he tried to bring multiparty system a few times unfortunately couldnt manage to do it before his death because in every attempt small but somewhat effective Islamist groups who hated secular change tried to abuse it caused him to postpone the plans before it becomes a major crisis Also the only thing he dictated was secularism related stuff which he thought was the only way to protect the country from repeating the later Ottoman mistakes 2 Headscarfs were only banned for public servants only during their jobs in their work place and for students Its purpose was whether you agree or not if its the right decision to prevent discrimination between women wearing headscarfs and who are not in the process of getting government jobs promoted or getting grades as students andor to prevent creating any concern of discrimination in the minds of people who receive the service Because significant percentage of Islamist people naturally without even thinking see headscarfed women as better muslims and has a bias that better muslims have higher morality so they couldshould be privileged Because of that notion and because you couldnt and shouldnt ban headscarfs from the public all together they thought this ban could at least minimize government based discrimination and any concern of discrimination of that kind Now the ban is over and after the referendum new laws and rules concerning publicservants are on the way which are going to weaken if not remove the jobsecurity of public servants bring lesstransparent and corruptable recruitment methods and promotion standards As a result naturally female publicservants who are not wearing head scarfs are one of the groups that feel under threat which is also an example of those discrimination concerns I tried to explain 3 The 2016 coup was not executed by secular Kemalists Theres an Islamist movement which began in 60s or 70s following a cult leader called Fethullah Gulen which slowly grew socially and ecconomicly by connecting with mainly religious conservative less educated and lowincome people of Turkey in the name of so called public service and Islam Provided scholarships for poor peoples kids helped their education tried to attract clever students to their schools and other educational structures Tried succeded in some degree to brainwash suitable religios oriented kids detected throughout their education with Gulens teachings making them believe they serve for a higher holly purpose Later canalized them into studying especially management law and other fields which are main branches recruited in the government Then tried to placeinfiltrate its followers who act as theyre not from the movement first in the critical duties which are related to recruitment promotion justice department intelligence and police then in time all around the government except military in some degree as military was more selective and also had strict disciplinary methods against possible cultist or Islamists The Gulen movements secrets and goals begin to be exposed by journalists secular politicians and those claims had decent media coverage in the late 90s and early 2000s Investigations began which caused Gulen to flee to USA but after AKP Erdogans party came to power in 2002 the allegations were quickly dropped and media coverage began to diminish except secular oppositions constant warning about the threat which AKP dismissed until 2014 or so In AKP ruling the Gulen movement became stronger and stronger in the government law and police force and in every field of governmental public service as AKP didnt have enough qualified people and built a partnership with them Also they passed laws that especially built a highway for Gulenists to rise in justice department They also managed to take control the government central exam system that recruits public servants and even military students Plus AKP constantly tried to weaken the military firewall I mentioned After Gulen had enough power in the police and justice department various antimilitary allegations investigations lawsuits began which ended up many military generals and highranked officers arrested using manifactured false evidence Although those evidence proven to be totally false and despite continous opposition warnings AKP supported those lawsuits for a long long time The imprisonement dismissal andor resignment of many generals and highranked officers opened a window for lowerranked secretly gulenist officers to rise in the military which they took and Gulen had a decent power in the military as a result After AKP and Gulen movement had some disagreements in 2014 their fight for power began First Gulenist tried to bring down Erdogan with corruption lawsuits about ministers and their sons including Erdogans son using the concrete evidence they easily collected during their partnership and government power But Erdoan managed to tear the lawsuits down quickly using his political power fiercely and creating a vast media propaganda campaign using the media who he slowly took control over the years After this attempt he tried to weaken Gulen by confiscating media owned by Gulen which fanatically supported Erdogan until their breakup by the way and Gulen controlled companies and a bank of Gulens which are thought to be the main financial sources of Gulen organization Then comes the Gulenist officers coup attempt who werent enough to control the whole military which is why the coup attempt failed not that Erdogan invited people to streets If the whole military joined the coup with full power and didnt hesitate to use fire power againts resistance not only in a few places but everywhere nobody could stop it There are many uncovered secrets and serious doubts about the coup too but I wont be going there in this post because it would be speculation 4 Now Erdoan declared Gulen organisation as a terrorist one which is actually justified and he is using the coup attempt and state of emergency laws to get rid of any opposition because it made a perfect excuse for him to fire andor jail people at will as there really were many Gulenists in the government and in every part of the community but public doesnt know who are He and his supporters can blame anyone being a secret Gulenist and that is now a major oppression method going on He already accused the opposition being a partner with Gulenists the same opposition who constantly warned him about the Gulen threat and always fought against Gulens false lawsuits during the referendum Unfortunately if hes elected the president with the new powers which he probably will be because he already controls the election system in the justice department which declared about 25 million illegal votes legal during the referendum the power will singlehandedly be his and the state of emergency laws will be the norm in the country Added Hours after I wrote this the very popular biggest secular opposition newspaper which always has been against Gulen organisation and fight against their false lawsuits and its owner and editors are under heavy investigation for supposedly helping Gulen organisation and trying to overthrow the government Their buildings are being searched by the police at the moment Probably I am next for writing this comment seriously,

Reading Turkish peoples writing from all different sides of the spectrum in English on this thread was 100x more educational than the video  and it was actually a pretty solid video Thank you all Turkish Kurdish Ataturk supporters and Erdogan supporters for voicing your opinion and your arguments in English It was very interesting to read as our media and educational system is so hyperfocused on itself instead of the rest of the world we rarely get to hear regular peoples candid and unedited opinions about the state of their nation directly from them,

July 2016 attempted coup was NOT a move by the secular army It was an attempted power grab by an organisation called FETO which has taken pivotal positions in military press business beurocracy and the judicial system over a course of 30 years One of the most senior commanders who woved to protect democracy and the elected government that night was an openly nonreligious man The arrests that came after was to cleanse the government of the FETO organisation Erdogan currently has less powers than POTUS Neither the USA nor Turkey is a dictatorship the people know what they are doing and this repeated ignorant style of reporting sickens the Turkish people,

Erdoan is a great man a great politician People love him for a good cause He is one of the most loved politicians in the World especially in asia and africa But not in the warmongering West and their brainwashed Population West gpal Was and is to exploit and abuse other nations But thanks to president Erdoan not with turkey Israel and USA are led by corrupt and criminal murderers like nuttyyahood or Trump bush  Co And those Bastards hate Mr Erdogan What a joke USA will demise and Israel will pay for its crimes before this failed zionist colony project is violently shut down and Palestine is given back to its rightful owners Make no mistake about that,

Turkey is doing amazing job helping over 20 million people in and near their country they are helping build my country Somalia the president of Turkey speaks out against injustices and speaks up for the oppressed he helps and cares for his country like no other and the Turkish people who dont sport him are truly one of the losers for rejecting their president who loves them so so much The world loves Turkey very very much band the world is not worried about Turkey only the West Because they dont want a Muslim majority country to be successful,

Really in diplomacy Turkey goes in wrong direction many times,
Turkey is a threat to modern western civilization And we love turkey for that,
Democratic Do you mean White Supremacy,
Western propaganda,
At referandum I voted no It was my first vote at an election But I had to lie to my family that I said yes They didnt say yes because system was good they said yes because the people who said no are terrorist in their opinion My people are weird at the politics lol,

this video should be titeled why israel is worried about turkey coz thats complete BS what i just watched,
I Turkey,
He will turn you into iran2,
You mean why the west is worried about turkey Im betting my house that The west will make war in turkey as they did the Middle east,
Earth is like a reality show for aliens,
This video should be called 2016 through the eyes of the american news,
Why would they play that song over the tragedy in Aleppo,
Wow 2016 really sucked,
Most ISIS attacks are in the Middle East but not many people care for them that is sad to know,
Lol what about the rest of the world,
So what I got from this was that Democrats lost so we should go to space Makes sense to me,
I guess we can conclude that 2016 was the shittiest year of the 21st century yet,
Pretty much dead people and dank memes,
The title of the video should be News concerning western world2016,
Paris climate agreement,
horrible choice in music placement,
Black Beatles over a clip of war destroyed Syria Wow,
2016 was so shitty they had to add an extra minute to cover it all,
Why does everyone ignore the Yemen conflict,

YOU GUYS FORGOT HARAMBE,

2016 was Horrible Pray for 2017,
You forgot the anti Trump riots Also the people who stayed at Aleppo praised Assad and Russia for liberating them,
2016 was a good year better than 2017 for sure,
am i the only one offended by the music when they show the war in syria lets put an awesome music in the background and show off proud what whe have done to that small country,
still better than YouTube rewind,
this made me cry wtf 2016,
Did you really have to play black beetles over the Syria crisis,
black beetles with Aleppo footage,
What an awful year,
How is anyone surprised that an american based liberal youtube channel would post a left of center  usa centric summary of 2016,
RIP Harambe 19992016 Forever in our hearts,
So we screw up this planet and then move on to another one,
409 Yall really didnt have to do them like that,
playing black beatles during that war scene feels so wrong,
2016 has been the most fragmented year Yes Everyones so divided,
What about the Bastille Day murders,
How is playing Black Beetle suitable for the the Refugee Crisis,
this seems like a recap that happens in movies before the zombie epidemic,
Thank you for putting part of Lins sonnet in this I needed that,

You could have added one more catastrophic event No mans sky,
Next year 2017 explained in 16 minutes,

playing Black Beatles while showing Syrias civil war footage was very appropriate,
At this point I dont care if the world were to burn I know it sounds corny but thats how it is,
Yet they forgot to cover the fact that golden state warriors blew a 31 lead,
Good stuff Vox and also one more mention India went cashlesscurrency ban,
This video suggest that 2016 was a year of death terrorism war and hate,
KEEP CRYING HAHAHHAA JUST KEEP CRYING,
Looking forward to what 2017 has to offer,
Selective memory at its finest bias completely one side and full of negativity,
This could be the most biased video I have ever seen you should be ashamed,
im sorry but why play Black Beatles over a clip of wartorn syria,
The real 2016 rewind,

Americas 2016 in 5 minute and 25 seconds Fixed your title,
I saw David bowie and screamed,
If youve watched the film you wouldve noticed the constant ticking in the background throughout the entire film The ticking only comes to a cease once the characters mentally realise theyre home Its a masterpiece of a film in its style but its not for everyone,
The endless staircase music in Mario 64 scared the crap out of me when I was a little kid Now I understand why,
IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE PLANE,
The Stukas sounded so real in Dunkirk Id hate to have to stand on a beach with one of those screaming down from the sky,
The film wouldnt have been the same without the soundtrack,
I was thinking Oh like the Mario 64 stairs and then you showed them,
The movies so intense I felt exhausted afterwards But thats the whole point I suppose,
I felt so oppressed during this movie it was amazing,
This movie was so freaking good The people that thought it was boring are clearly too young to understand what actually happened in Dunkirk or cannot appreciate the sound visual effects and psychological thrill aspect of the movie The movies purpose was not to tell a story the purpose is to make you feel like you were one of the 400000 soldiers escaping Dunkirk with your life on the line If you expected a love story or a dialogue heavy story youre going to be disappointed with this movie,
Damn another reason to show how ahead of their time Pink Floyd was,
chris nolanhans zimmerMAGNUM OPUS,
Yo did anyone else jump when the movie first start and there are those super loud gun shots,
Echoes best Pink Floyd song,
Honestly I love it when a score for a movie matches its tone and helps set the right tone and simply Zimmer is a genius with his scores I loved the hell out of Dunkirk it was a genuine Masterpiece,
Wow Sometimes when Im trying to sleep but my mind is still hyper I imagine a jet engine turning off But sometimes I dont do it right so it turns out exactly like 130138 and it takes a while for me to go to sleep Good to know that it has a name Thanks for nothing ShepherdRisset Glissando,
Fun fact the ticking clock from Dunkirk is Nolans own recorded by Zimmer,
shepard tones are what anxiety sounds like,
also very interesting nolan tried to apply the concept of the shepards tone to the narrative as well i think that he very much achieved that goal the three narratives are balanced brilliantly and the film just doesnt stop piling on it was one of the most intense movie experiences of my life i felt physically exhausted after watching or rather experiencing it i think it works like this Air  high pitch dogfights gliding and shooting down that stuka and ferrier quietly landing on the beach far away Mole  middle pitch from start to finish very intense getting shot at in the streets stuka bombing runs ships exploding almost drowning returning to the beach and getting on mr dawnsons boat Sea  low pitch leaving england hearing the spitfires witnessing dogfights and taking the soldiers and board bomber crashing and the sea burning anybody agree,
I shouldnt have to say this but to those uninformed Hans Zimmer is a genius,
At least Dunkirk will win best sound effects for Oscar 2017 I really hope it will also win the best picture but its 2017,
all it takes is clever sound design and a christoper nolan and an extra hans zimmer,
i watched dunkirk twice and i was so obsessed with the music and the ticking noise throughout the movie it really brought the movie to its peak i heard about that the ticking sound was from one of christopher nolans old vintage pocket clocks and i love the personal touch from the director,
I muted the TV *you cant scare me*,
Hans Zimmers work is out of the world,
130 Sounds like the trains in Sydney,
this can sound spooky Me More like a jet engine reving up,
Fantastic movie I held off until it was at an Imax theatre near me so glad I had that opportunity Itll never be the same on my laptop,
Its like audiable cocaine constantly waiting for a climax that never comes,
fortunately the movie length is only about one and a half hour cause i nearly died on imax seat hearing that intense beat,
Saw the movie in theatre and the soundtrack was amazing,
The oscar judges must have watched this video,
Sounds like a airplane lifting off or landing,
SO THIS WAS HOW THEY DID THAT INSTAGRAM MEME,
The sound of the planes in dunkirk was so intense,
DUDE you talk too much let me listen to the tone the looped one D,
The sound effects in Dunkirk made the movie go from epic to legendary,
Dunkirk was really overrated,
St Vincents song called Black Rainbow does the same effect as well Its so trippy,
Hans Zimmer is a genius,
Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan  *GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL* watch Interstellar,
Hans Zimmer is a genius,
Hans Zimmer did the music composing of the Call of Duty Modern warfare series I think,
Excellent analysis of the Nolan scores Also the best explanation and demo of Shepard tones Ive ever seen Bravo,
Nolan and Zimmer are a perfect match the score and the direction in Dunkirk give rise to some of the most intense scenes Ive ever come across,
My sighs were raising higher  higher when i seen the classification of 12a certificate VOX is the SJW version of F0X,
This movie felt so good in the theatre ,
It all makes complete sense now The score in the Dunkirk film is intense to say the least Mega,
I feel like all of Zimmers scores only have the illusion to go anywhere but theres never any substance,
Dunkirk is a very different movie and not your standard war movie There is very little dialogue a very simple plot not much gore and almost no character development  I think I remember 1 characters name The movie is not for everyone because of how different it is and some will find it very boring That being said I really enjoyed it the sound was amazing and in every scene I felt completely immersed in what was happening I like how it show 3 different perspective of land air and sea and I like how the movie wasnt crazy long like other war movies If you havent seen it yet go into the movie expecting it to be different and you may or may not like it depending on what I mentioned,
Hans zimmer for top DJ 2018,
the bwoom sound from inception is the best,
I dont hear the shepard tone in dunkirk I hear it of course in the shepardrisset glissando the endless stairs echoes colorado springs and the batbpod though Im not using headphones so if its low frequencyquiet that could be why,
Movie is worth watching for the sound design alone It felt more like something out of the Silent Hill games than a conventional war film,
 We can pratically see it from here  What   The oscar,
*yahoo noises in sm64* me *WELL WHY NOT MAKE THAT YAHOO A BLJ INSTEAD*,
It is a loop Just like the stairwell,
When you load the vid at 144p but it still buffers,
Sorry its not a Shepard tone in Dunkirk Yes the tone rises but returns to its fundamental at regular intervals,
Who had goosebumps when the Spitfires flies over,
Dunkirk has an amazing soundtrack as well with the others It makes it really suspenseful ,
The reversed Shepard Risseto glissando thing sounds like my washing machine slowing down,
very intense spook spook,
Hans Zimmer is genius,
I really enjoyed this film and will add it to my favorite war film stock for sure There were quite a few guys at my work who didnt care for it because there wasnt a whole lot of action for them as is custom in most war films Id categorize the style as more artsy in Its structure and have no problems with that,
Zimmer is brilliant,
what a great movie but it isnt quite for everyone,
I cant look that movie same way ever again Amazing video subscribed,
Its unfortunate that only a small percentage of film audiences appreciates sound design and score when sound is 50 of what film as a craft is Videos like these that expose the brilliance in these aspects of film should be watched by more people,
Believe me it will get too many oscars ,
Hans Zimmers CRYSIS 2,
Hans Zimmer is really great ComposerThe Nolans Picture is incomplete without Hans Listen Time  Hans Zimmer Inception,
that Shephard thing was also used in dark knights WHY SO SERIOUS,
My uncle is Hans Zimmer Sadly he is not a composer,
Totally noticed the constant ticking in Dunkirk Pure tension Loved it Good movie,
Dunkirk OST explained 1 Put your intern in an engine room 2 Make him record 90 minutes of engine noise 3 Send the recording to Nolan 4 Nolan shuffles the chunks,
Hans Zimmer is like the Einstein of music,
This was amazing Such an intense score perfect for the film Awesome job man,
I had the pleasure of watching the film last Sunday at Phenomena cinema in Barcelona It was a 70mm showing with DTS audio Before the film began however one of the staff members a Director of Photography explained that Nolan himself had been to the cinema a couple of weeks before for a private showing and had calibrated the projector and audio to his liking His audio tastes were peculiar to say the least We were told that the volume we were going to experience was slightly lower than what Nolan requested due to how loud it was They were right every gunshot was deafening and the pacing of the film combined with the overwhelmingly loud soundtrack and immersive experience of the 70mm film made for an intense experience I was genuinely recoiled in my seat and physically recoiling with each gunshot,
When you didnt know this was a thing but used it in FL Studio before Hey I understand everything now Really doesnt,
THankyou I love this so much Going to suggest the shephard tone to my music teacher to teach everyone ,
if u havent realized it yet this is the same effect from that meme the one that ksi reacted to the sound that seemingly gets higher and higher and never stops,
When i was 6 i remember play super mario 64 and going up the endless stairs and the sound scared me so much,
there was a hans zimmer ad before this,
Thank you Even the engineers on Pink Floyds great Meddle could not explain this properly crossfades Bravo for your brilliant video,
121 sounds like an electric manglev train throttling up 131 and the manglev throttles down,
Ok I have known about this audio trick being used in the Dark Knight for the Batpod But this is the FIRST time I have EVER understood what it was because it was explained well Thank you for this,
Hans Zimmer is a freaking Genius,
And again i learned something Pretty interesting Thanks for sharing,
Dunkirk  Hands down the best film of the 21st century and top 5 war films ever made Overall into the top 20 films ever made,
This was the most boring movie ive seen in my life it was garbage ,
Brian May used this effect back in the 70s on the very first track of A Day at the Races He said it was the audio equivalent of MC Eschers Impossible staircase,
i cant believe Dunkirk lost the Oscar for the Best Original Score to freaking The Shape of Water,
Anyone want Interstellar 2,
Perhaps one reason despit Dunkirk being half the length of Interstellar it seems almost as substantial  there is epic scale and tension generated throughout,
Now I know how Star Trek gets the warpdrive sound effects,
Of course is Hanz Zimmer who else would it be lol,
Chris  zimmer  best team,
Hans Zimmer is a legend but I found Dunkirk boring in terms of story the OST was great,
Nolans films are often all about time Wait Did you just No i mean I didnt know all this while,
Hans Zimmer the Mozart of the 21st century Max Richter the Chopin of the modern world Clint Mansell the Antonio Vivaldi of today,
Had a commercial for the Dunkirk movie before this video,
Man I love this Contact  last track on Daft Punks RAM album,
The film was as repetitive as Shepard tones,
Also the exact same technique is used in the soundtracks rhythm during the film slow beat gets faster really fast then fades out as a 4 times slower tempo version starts to fade in continuous loop,
The ticking was an amazing element to the score My favorite use of that motif was in the second season finale of Hannibal It gets subtly faster and faster throughout the entire episode It was brilliant,
I didnt find the film intense in fact except for some rather nice cinematography I thought that the film was pretty darn blah What was needed IMO is some footage of the defense of the Dunkirk perimeter by the French and remaining British troops The whole sequence of the troops in the barge as it was being machine gunned was too long  almost to the point of being boring The film had no buildup high point and finale I am glad that I saw it but would certainly not recommend it Who am I I am a retired combat cameraman with 26 months incountry cinematography experience in Vietnam during 19661971,
One of the only good vids made by vox props,
Amazing movie crucial moment in World War II,
hans zimmer  chris nolan perfection,
watched Dunkirk in IMAX super loud and intense,
Sound design on this film was brilliant Just seen Dunkirk in IMAX Wow,
I want to see the movie now,
I noticed this in Dunkirk A LOT Even before this video it made me clench my butt cheeks,
Were you rushing or draging,
Chrostopher nolan  his team are legends,
i really got depressed after watching Dunkirk,
Hans Zimmers MasterClass ad played on this video Coincidence I dont think so,
This is gonna be a tough competition at the Oscars,
My theory on the clock is that thier running out of time but they never actually do thats why the clock keeps on going,
This technique perfect for making beat loops in fl studio,
I need that sound effect as my notification tone when Luftwaffe first flies over the Minesweeper,
Thx for teaching me a bit of music theory more knowledge to my music,
I already knew what a shepherds tone was because of Gravity Falls,
There is ticking in The Thin Red Line also violin plucks and then flute staccato Track name Journey to the line,
Yesss I was just listening to Echoes by Pink Floyd on my way home after Dunkirk,
A video about Dunkirk that doesnt take USA todays review out of context Nice,
Zimmer didnt inventer those tones Super Mario 64 did x for those who understand the joke and reference,
Saw Dunkirk yesterday in the Smithsonian and I can say it was easily the best movie Ive seen from 2017 so far,
When I saw Dunkirk in the theatre I was overwhelmed by the score Some parts of the music were so simple yet portrayed such a powerful feeling This composer is a genius,
Hans Zimmer is a living legend,
In my opinion its creepier when it goes down then when it goes up,
For some fun with Shepard Tones listen to Slow Moving Trains by Godspeed You Black Emperor,
Time to watch it,
The soundtrack is probably Zimmers best work in terms of effectiveness And the whole sound design is fantastic eg the shots in the first scen the planes later ,
I was thinking of Pink Floyd during the explanationsthen video shows Echoes ,
Trump made this great again,
I just love Dunkirks soundtrack It creates prefect atmosphere for the film Zimmer is genius,
I thought I was the only one picking up on the soundstones in the Dunkirk film Great video DUNKIRK,
hans zimmers score for dunkirk starts with the sound of ticking andthatsacommonthemein thelegendarycomposers work,
This Video is in the Playlist of the original Soundtrack xD Search Water Towers Dunkirk Original Soundtrack,
Its not pronounced as Zimmer in an English way its Tsimmer,
I love Vox but theyre almost always wrong about music stuff eg that video about the Christmas chord Zimmer isnt using anything like a Shepard Tone here Hes ascending and descending by a minor 2nd interval creating a false sense of motion,
Hey look there are papers falling from the sky *jumps from seat*,
Good information I wondered what they were doing with the sounds,
After watching a Hans Zimmer  Christopher Nolan film Im always inspired to go write,
The ticking is also utilised in one of the greatest WW2 films ever made The Thin Red Line,
Unpopular opinion Mick Gordon made better use of the Shepard tone for Doom than Zimmer for Dunkirk Both geniuses in their own way,
Somehow the soundtrack reminded me to Gravity by its atmosphere Is pretty similar maybe different techniques but somehow both sounded similar,
Dunkirk is my favorite country in the US,
Just one word GENIUS,
Dunkirk should atleast win an award for cinematography,
Now that u perfectly explained the endless rising pitch that i had doubts of my sound perception for years,
SMH people think that Hans Zimmer is like the modern day Frans Liszt,
Just walked out of the cinema My head still spinning lol,
That Zimmer guy is a genius no doubt,
Did anyone else feel inspired by that Hanz Zimmer Ad,
Hanz Zimmer is just legendary,
I like it when Vox makes a video thats not about Trump,
Im so glad I watched this video Ive noticed this effect before and never knew how they achieved it Great post,
Sick of vox,
Yo Watch this in IMAX My heart was pounding throughout the whole movie Quite enjoyable and probably the closest I will get to being in war and this is coming from a film Masterpiece and a instant rainy Sunday classic,
They use the same effect in Mr Robot and its absolutely petrifying Excellent bit of sound design in all these productions,
Vox is honestly like 99pi but with an accompanying video lol,
Love Hans but dunkirk just kept on building but never really delivered kind of burnt itself out pity,
The rising ShepardRiset Glissando should be familiar to science fiction fansThe postrefit Enterprise warp drive in STTMP ,
128 Thats not spooky Thats amazing,
Dunkirk is my country,
Dam Amma go watch Diz movie right now,
The score was absolutely awful in Dunkirk Not a single memorable track,
I couldnt experience the real soundtrack when I went to see Dunkirk in the theater because they had the bass turned up so damn high that half of the soundtrack was just pure bass,
Yall ever played Mario 64 and went up the endless stairs  So basically this is it,
Love the way he included Michael Caine in the film Amazing film in Imax,
This movie is a freaking crazy Nolan and Zimmer blew me theyre mad geniuses Interstellars still my fav tho,
I didnt know Interstellar and Dunkirk soundtracks were by the same composer but I recognised the same endless music from both But nice to understand how they did it,
when i watched dunkirk in theaters for the first time i loved the way they used the sounds so much that i went to see it in IMAX the next day to hear it even more intensely XD,
How did I get from Cyanide and Happiness to this,
So its an inception style loop in Dunkirk Mind blown,
Man you didnt mentioned Journey to the Line from The Red Thin Line that I think is his most famous ticking track,
First video that actually managed to explain the Shepard tone illusion in simple terms and with helpful pictures thank you,
this move really makes you *feel* like dunkirk,
To me it only seems to wotk with the CHROMATIC scale Tried it with a whole Bunch of scales,
The spitfire  the nighttime sinking of the shipscenes elicited physical reactions of discomfort from me,
Just watched the film I was amazing amazing amazing ,
This movie was INSANE i mean seriously Christopher Nolan is a genius,
masterclass  com brought me here,
Hans Zimmer is GOAT,
Dunkirk was phenomenal,
Planes  Ticking clocks are what make a film scary and intense,
Ive seen this movie four times in theaters Its that good,
Nice contextual ad on the preroll Masterclass with Hans Zimmer,
Interstellar soundtrack always blows my mind,
Thats a nice metaphor to describe Nolan and Zimmers work  a very simple little thing that is just going in circles but everyone loses their minds on,
Wow I always wondered how the the staircase in Super Mario 64 worked,
Hans Zimmer masterpiece,
I love Hans Zimmers work,
A nice change from Voxs incessant identity politics and the RussiaTrump conspiracy theory,
I cant hear the shepard tone increase or decrease in volume it sounds all the same to me,
What a great film loved it watched it in cinema several months ago and bloody Hanz Zimmer how much money does he have his music is in every film,
I remember this from Vsauce,
I was freezed while watching Dunkirk LiterallyI spilled cold drink on my pants and sat there like that I walked out wet What an experience,
Somebody is getting a 2nd Oscar for BEST SCORE,
Pro end weak zaisqt colony friendly strange property most,
The Dark Knight Why so Serious also has a similar technique suprised it wasnt mentioned,
Dunkirk is a scientific war film,
The only illusion that makes Dunkirk sound so intense is IMDB,
and in Pink Floyd That sounds very painful awkward or intriguing depending on how far inside Pink Floyd it is Perhaps an edit is in order,
Dunkirk depicted the hurry up and wait aspect of war so perfectly,
Ok fine the internet peer pressure has convinced me to go watch it,
I really didnt enjoy Dunkirk Nothing really happened,
The endless stairs theme in Super Mario 64 is exactly what I had in mind whilst watching this,
Nolan is my fav 3,
I absolutely loved the dogfight scenes in Dunkirk they were amazing and very realistic ,
Duhhh because Hans Zimmer is the GOAT,
Alot of the soundtrack of this movie was played ridiculously loud in movie theaters detracting from what was happening on the screen,
Infrasound and shepards tone A Lethal Combo,
Amazing explanation of an auditory illusion Surprised more politicians arent using this in their ads to hypnotize us ,
Curious How does this connect to Zimmers of Elgars Nimrod variation,
Hans is always an inspiration to many in music production including me hes an awesome composer,
this was the clearest explanation of shephards tone thanks ,
I was super tense just watching this video,
Always Ascending by Franz Ferdinand,
Wow thank you for sharing this video,
Vox is so underrated deserve so many more subscribers,
Thanks As a musician of moderate skill and theorist Ive known about this for a while but never really knew how it worked Very neat,
DUNKIRK Sound design was just over the top exhausting I felt very manipulated into high tension The occasional ticking effect I found great though,
Its not as if I m gonna be into music or such all my life but this video has made my life better Thanks,
Ive seen Dunkirk in IMAX it was absolutely amazing One of the most intense movies Ive ever seen,
Tbh Hans Zimmer could make a rusty trash can look and sound so ominous and chilling,
I love how Echoes was referenced,
Watched the film last Tuesday It was amazing,
This film is gorgeous on IMAX,
In this case that ticking tone was inspired by a pocket watch,
No joke Dunkirk gave me a short episode of anxiety and I blame this very tone for most of it,
This is like a Nerdwriter1 video,
Honestly if Id got the opportunity to watch this in IMAX I would probably have needed respiratory assistance,
Dunkirk has one of the best soundtracks ever,
Proud of knowing this before this video,
Yes I was constantly commenting how the tension incessantly kept going higher I was impressed,
Isnt that weird how this thing kinda makes u feel Like what if humans could be controlled through some sort of sound like that Its a conspiracy,
goddamn GERMANS i mean ZIMMERthey are always the best,
The music of blade runner was amazing,
Ive conceptualized this in my mind before Surprised it works this well,
Damn son i was thinking about the Endless Stairs before he showed that example fascinerande,
Zimmer  Legend for a reason,
That reverse sound was just so depressing 130 to 135,
Hearing that loud high pitch screech of the planes was amazing,
this is the kind of videos youtube was intended forbrilliant I learned something today,
thats why i love nolan and zimmer,
Hi Vox How do you make the graphic sound waves in the video As a young editor Im just curious By the way great video ,
The soundtrack of Dunkirk is insane especially in a theatre,
Hans Zimmer isjust marvelous,
Watched this on the plane almost jumped out,
kudos to Hans Zimmer and the sound engineers for this movie,
Hans Zimmer is the celebrity I would choose to have dinner with I adore his work,
125 not spooky but like a spaceship takingoff,
Hans Zimmer everybody never doubt this guy,
Exactly the reason why I dont like the score It just rises but not going anywhere Nolan and Zimmer always want you to think something big is about to happen But the climax never comes,
Hans Zimmer is a God amongst men,
A lot of stuff contribute to the suspense but sound it one of the biggest ones thanks for explaining how it works an how to manipulate sound to get intense feel,
That was both fascinating and informative Now that were done with that please proceed telling me how I should atone for my white male privilege,
Hey does anybody know about technoelectronic music track that may use that  im sure thatd sound dope af in techno or progressive ,
This is information on sound I never knew I needed Crazy cool,
This is why Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan make an incredible duo,
Hans Zimmer is a genius,
The Dark Knight trilogy also heavily depends heavily upon Zimmers famous ticking,
I have premium thing for Dunkirk and made sounds better screen better everything so good and the speakers just made me jump,
Watched Dunkirk on 2007 such a good film *N O L A N G E N I U S*,
WHY CANT I REMOVE THIS VIDEO FROM THE OST PLAYLIST ,
I really love the OSTs for Dunkirk the ticking time theme really fits considering the topic of the movie In the real Dunkirk time was also of the essence Clock ticks is a really intense and amazing way to show that,
why not talk about how the film constructs a inaccurate narrative of the dunkirk event and the war in general as well as is fueling nationalistic sentiment in the uk,
To be honest I felt pretty lost watching Dunkirk Its got a great score and fantastic cinematography but much of what makes a story memorable seemed missing to me I couldnt name any characters besides Alex the characters had pretty minimal personalities and I never caught on that the film would alternate from three different perspectives that last ones probably on me though I guess I walked in with the wrong mindset Looking back its more like a documentary that puts you at the center of the action which when put into words like that sounds pretty freaking awesome,
fun fact Bill Ciphers favorite song is ten hours of Shepard tone,
everyone is tricking someone in this world to gain some advantage nothing new here,
Hans Zimmer the GOAT,
Idk what they are talking about in this video but I liked it cuz Dunkirk,
The movie aint a nightmareIt is based upon a nightmare,
Best sounding film Ive ever seenheard,
127 sounds like the enterprise engines in the new star trek movies,
Hans Zimmer is my man,
Brilliant thanks for this video explained quite a bit,
IT MADE ME SO ANXIOUS IN THE THEATRE I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT I SWEAR,
Oh so thats what tihs is called I havent seen dunkirk yet but I did try this thing in some improvisations based of what i heard in a video game,
The plane scene was cool but this movie was very anti climatic for me,
the ticking effect worked really well in Nick of time and Bourne 1  2,
Go watch inception  the movie  and then come back to watch this again you understand it better,
I felt so damn cold in the theaters while watching this,
125 one day well have aircrafts that sound like this and do space travel,
YES MORE INTERSTELLAR AND HANS ZIMMER PLEASE,
You can hear it during the endless stairs in super mario 64 Yeah unless you BLJ to skip it,
The engine sounds in Elite Dangerous are also shepherd tones,
One of the best movies I have ever seen The soundtrack is what definitely makes this movie and just builds the suspense,
Dunkirk is such a good movie and with Hans zimmer music makes it better way better,
Why is the thumbnail a screen from Battlefield 1,
Shepards Tone  Shepherds Pie,
Is that the same effect used in the intro for the show Lost I find it mesmerizing,
My dutch teatcher played in this movie not a big role but a role is a role Im sorry to say but the spitfires sound effects are totally not accurate to the real sounds,
Ive heard of this before,
This helped me in DNBHL,
When i clicked the video i got a Hans Zimmer classes trailer video,
I thought they were going to show audios of real life Dunkirk,
For more dont miss the first episode of Vox Borders Colombia Johnny Harris traveled to Ccuta a city on the border between Colombia and Venezuela to see how the country is handling a massive wave of refugees fleeing the economic crisis Watch httpsyoutubeNU0RqwweuWY,

This is so unfortunate The inflation is unreal Nobody deserves this Love from India,
God help Venzualans The world,
Vox creating propaganda for the west since its creation,
Who are the major oil buyers from Venezuela And why arent the oil profiteers part of this video Finally how will sanctions which essentially punish the poor Venezuelans fix the problem of a corrupt leader,
Here in Colombia we are feeling the damages people of Venezuela is escaping here asking for jobs or selling things on the public transport i dont think the people on the comnents in the USA can remotly feel all the impacts you can know the facts but nothing near like the reality,
Ingnorance is strong with the comment section,
Lived there in mid eighties Was so beautiful So very sad,
SoUS sanctions have not affected this country over the years Hmmmm,
I didnt hear one thing which tells me why the US should intervene Fix the poverty in your own country before you try to help another Fix your own elections before you fix another countrys,

May God help the people of Venezuela and all those in need in the mighty name of Yeshua Jesus Christ,
US want the oil PETRLEO of VENEZUELA,
You dont say anything about the USA embargo that is affecting the economy and social life of this country,
Why Vox is praising Chavez so much He is literally the one responsible for what is happening in Venezuela you forgot about the expropriation of thousands of private businesses he armed civilian militias he killed and persecuted political rivals He closed hundreds of radios and major TV channels he implemented laws to censor the media he fired thousands of people from the public sector and ban the from having a job just because the signed a petition against his presidency he started the wave of corruption and political centralization he changed the constitution to stay in power You certainly did a good investigation from the last few years but you have literally no idea of what happened before Maduro I mean Luisa Ortega Diaz leader of the opposition You guys call yourself journalist,
This is not true Maduro is actually popular Sounds like iraq afghanistan at al,
God Bless Venezuela in the Name of Jesus Love from Indonesia,
If there citizens had guns this could have never happened,
From the heart of Texas San Antonio Sending love  prayers to the hard working people of Venezuela may God intervene  send his waring angels to protect the God loving citizens pronouncing a God FEARING President to take shape in Jesus name,

God save Venezuela much loves from Indonesia I believe that you guys can make it just like my country at 1998 inflation,
I think Venezuela will be something like Syria soon and thats pretty sad These are political games and European countries Russia and USA may be involved into this probs,
You should have your own show on Fox or MSNBC or CNN,
The president is the fat version of Stalin,
The United States and its allies are creating the economic crisis This kind of regime change strategy is not new in Latin America You can draw correlation to any of the 20 countries weve overthrown there Guaido is another Pinochet Once in power hell sell of Venezuelans assists enrich the minority espaoles and reform cut all programs that Chavez had put in place that nearly cut unemployment and homelessness in half How do sanctions help the people  Ask the North Koreans how those sanction helped them Ask the Cubans Ask any country that has been overthrown by the us of their sanction ever helped the well being of the people they claim to be fighting for Utter hypocrisy,
Dont forget Chavez Venezuela problema started long before Maduro Smh,
Being an immigrant from Mexico here in the US all I wish for is peace for every country We are with you my brothers and sisters from Venezuela God Bless you all,
US puppet vs Venezuelan president,
Really vox Were just ignoring socialisms massive role in that shitshoe,
God help Venezuela Love from Aussie Australia,
I was surprised to see this came out from Vox Vox now looks more and more like me too mediaMSM without journalism spirit I Quote,
Incompetent policies and corruption under both Maduro and Chavez have impoverished a oncewealthy nation while dissent has been brutally crushed,
Love how Vox avoids saying the word socialism because that is exactly what Bernie Sanders was advocating for the US he even praised Venezuela as a model for ending income inequality five years ago Socialism works until you run out of peoples money Venezuela is just the latest example Thankfully a lot of people here have not forgotten history Socialism always fail from the Soviet Union China Cuba Greece and now Venezuela and so many more When you dont learn from history you are doomed to repeat it I wonder which socialist country is next,
Next step in the evolution of Marxism is Communism Had Venezuela not become a Socialist State the govt would not own and control everything When you chain the people they become slaves of govt Time to free the people of Venezuela so they can choose individually their own destiny Freedom or death I always choose freedom,
Now nobody believes you anymore rip to Libya Syria Yugoslaviayou will pay dearly for the evil you have committed,
God will save Venezuela LOVE 4M INDIAAAA,
Al Jazera lied a lot about the Venezuelan crisis The bloqueo usa and the violence of the opposition never is mentioned Are you being paid by the Cia too,
Hold on Ya telling me the crisis is more complicated than simply shouting SOCIALISM Well wadda know,
Vox run by 19 yearold clowns,
oh yeah and their inflation also rose to 12 million bruh,
its the US and jews destroying venezuela,
Did any of you saying that Vox didnt mention how socialism ruined their economy actually watch the video They clearly said Chavez spent more than he should on welfare It feels like people try really hard to be extreme leftists or extreme right and never listen,
Probably this nightmare qent caused for Saudi ONU CIA and qhole Obama secreteriat including Ash Carter  con,
Madura has failed in being a leader of a country,
Very interesting video but Forjada means impulsed not forced*,
Good luck Venezuela Love from Asia,
Good job Vox You forgot to mention the SOCIALISM,
Many of my friends live in Venezuela I dont know how they manage,
Now you see why Trump makes building the wall a national emergency,
Good facts but where is the other side of the coin,
Socialism doesnt work and when it doesnt it will lead to communism,
Maduro looks like a car salesman that would rip every penny from your pocket,
Having Guaido declare himself President is like Father Guido Sarducci declaring himself Pope,
vox wouldnt understand even if theyre left wing parasites,
May God help Venezuela return to her former glory,

Socialism that is the reason of the collapse ask any Venezuelan that has gotten out of the country what they think of Socialism China Russia Korea Vietnam Cambodia Cuba and now Venezuela Sweden isnt a Socialism countries they have high benefits but they are moving to more capitalist countries selling off businesses like the phone company airport and a lot more because socialism almost bankrupted them and was causing massive inflation Vox stop your disinformation campaign Sweden Lessons for America httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjq3vVbdgMuQ,

Ok USA and EU will bring you democraty 039 this why you have so many problemes,
Chavez was no hero to the poor he was buying their votes while he took away their rights The free press is gone individually owned companies were seized and people were fired from their life long jobs if they didnt vote for Chavez He changed the constitution to keep himself in power forever he wasnt a hero to the poor he was a dictator He loved Putin and was best friends with Castro He would have been in the same situation as Maduro if he hadnt died,

Vox I strongly encourage you to dig deeper This video does no good by laying the blame on the incompetent Maduro All of this disaster was put in motion by Chavez Seriously Look deeper and apply your videography skills to something worth telling,
How about making a new video about the current political chaos situation in Venezuela,
You picture everything as an internal cross As far as i know usa was always involved and was playing to overtrow the regime since Chavez came to power,

Aaron Russo said America wants to invade Venezula in that famous AJ interview,
Wait why is Vox blaming Maduro Maduro is actually doing everything Chavez did just without the charisma Chavez started it all and now because the socialist lie came crashing down its Maduros fault Yes its Maduros fault that nothing is being resolved today but Vox even acknowledges at 345 that Chavez intentionally screwed the economy just to stay in power Yet they still seem to paint him as a beloved leader instead of a corrupt communistmonger who he himself claimed communist leader Fidel Castro as his mentor Why beat around the bush Vox A highly thriving country is now in shambles because of the initial actions of a powerhungry socialist Hugo Chavez and now his VicePresident is an authoritarian,
320  409 sounds like socialism to me,
God help Venezuela Love from America,

I didnt hear one word about socialism because its always their fault and we can do it better,
People often forget that the collapse in global oil prices in 2014 is one major cause of Venezuelas economic collapse,
America and isreal is behind this crises What a shame,
Since the 1998 election of Hugo Chavez the United States has fought to restore control over Venezuela and is vast oil reserves Chavezs socialist programs may have redistributed the countrys wealth and helped lift millions out of poverty but they also earned him a target on his back In 2002 Venezuelas rightwing opposition briefly ousted him with US support and recognition before the military restored his presidency following a mass popular mobilization Throughout the administrations of US Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama Chavez survived numerous assassination plots before succumbing to cancer in 2013 His successor Nicolas Maduro hassurvivedthree attemptson his life The Trump administration immediately elevated Venezuela to the top of Washingtons regime change target list branding it the leader of atroika of tyrannyLast year Trumps national security teamattemptedto recruit members of the military brass to mount a military junta but that effort failed According to the Venezuelan government the US was also involved in a plot codenamed Operation Constitution to capture Maduro at the Miraflores presidential palace and another calledOperation Armageddonto assassinate him at a military parade in July 2017 Just over a year later exiled opposition leaderstried and failed to kill Madurowith drone bombs during a military parade in Caracas More than a decade before these intrigues a group of rightwing opposition students were hand selected and groomed by an elite USfunded regime change training academy to topple Venezuelas government and restore the neoliberal order,

I dont usually like Vox as they tend to lean heavily left But credit where credit is due you did a good job this time,
God help Venezuela,
The answer is socialism doesnt work Equal distribution of poverty among the serfs and riches for the elite ruling class,
333 the minute or so from here was the start of the problem Promising free stuff to everyone and just praying that it can be sustained after you die,
Forgot to mention Chavez fired well trained people in everything from economics to oil production in favor of people loyal to him,
USA is a Military dictatorship even after all the noble efforts of USA forefathers constitutional safe guards Barak signed away the media propaganda ban and militarised the police And congress frowns on oath takers to appease their Israeli Masters Yes the USA is no less than a colonised nation of Israel you ought to call yourselves the ISA instead of the USA,
Socialismo morte,
When things are going well its all about socialism When socialism inevitably collapses in on itself after economic mismanagement caused when government gains too much power over an economy its not about socialism at all,
And how did we fix that in the great depression FDR THE NEW DEAL,
The Curse of Hugo Chavez,
VOX Propaganda ,
So youre blaming this on Maduro Hmmm Not the US or European allies to the US I sense this may be heavily slanted,
Vox why are your videos so good and tightly editied Have you ever made a video explaining that If you see this that would be super appreciated,

trump has shown time and again that hes capable of a totalitarian power grab like this if he thought he could get away with it,

Just more proof socialism doesnt work,
The collapse of Venezuela Explained *Socialism* Thanks and goodbye,
I can explain they have oil and they are socialists West doesnt like that There you go,
Vox you completely misrepresented Chavezs role in the breakdown of Venezuela He is the individual who brought corruption socialism and a dramatic increase of drugs into Venezuela You say that he improved food subsidies education and health care but that is simply false He only invested in regions where he needed votes He rigged many of his elections changed the constitution to benefit himself and collapsed Venezuela Maduro is only the puppet that still remains from Chavezs rule Maduro whose credentials before being president were being a bus driver has made the situation much worse in Venezuela but to say that Chavez improved the quality of life in Venezuela is not only a lie but it is also disgusting because it perpetuates a narrative that keeps these dictators in power,
Vox apoya al golpe y a la intervencin imperialista de los EEUU Qu lstima,
Lies All lies How about the Venezuelan people decide for themselves,
At what point is Madura gonna get assassinated by someone who has been forced out of work and turned to hitman work,
What this video left out was that the ChavezMaduro regimes purged all of the technocrats and engineers out of the oil industry replacing them with incompetent and inexperienced communist ideologues Venezuelas oil production and efficiency took a hit because of that Similar thing happened in Iraq when the neocons placed American political hacks in power who had no experience in the Middle East to help the Iraqis rebuild the country They had no idea what the hell they were doing This is what happens when ideology trumps reason and logic,
This was actually a very good video very informative and very correct good job thanks for bringing this situation to the world 1 The poor didnt bring Chavez to power it was the middle class The poor didnt even vote in 1998 that came later on 2 Chavez didnt spend millions on social programs for the poor Social programs existed before Chavez he just destroyed them when he came to power so that the government didnt have those expenses But then in a moment in time when he was unpopular he created social programs again this is when he brought the poor into the voting system and threw some money at them at this point oil prices were high so he could do that and still STEAL millions The social programs created by Chavez wereare HIGHLY inefficient zero transparency a lot of money goes into them and most of it disappears without yielding real world results other than propaganda 3 When Chavez was in government he didnt do any of those things because of good management he just had so much money oil went from 11 to 150 during his time in office that he could steal a lot and also give some back to the country Chavezs daughter is one of the richest persons in latin America 4 Chavez made the people dependent on the government He stole most of the privately owned companies in the country that actually produced and exported goods and then ran them to the ground because of unqualified workers taking over He had so much oil income that he basically gave very cheap dollars to new companies many from his friends to import goods instead of producing them here bringing Venezuelan companies to bankruptcy the ones he didnt steal He single handedly destroyed the country its just that Maduro is paying for it because oil prices went down on his watch 5 Updated black market rate is 17000 per dollar And the official rate for friends and family is 10 imagine how much money you can generate with that exchange system 6 Luisa Ortega Diaz is not an opposition leader more like a government defector that starting opposing it for her own political agenda She is as corrupt and disgusting as the ones currently in government but hey if you want to jump ship we will welcome you UPDATE 8 months later May 2018 you need to pay 950000 for a single dollar And it is expected to rise rapidly in the coming months,

Maduro will end up in the cemetery,
Who did they poll to get the 80 If 75 of the people voted for Maduro this doesnt make any sense,
Link that pole that said 80 of the people want madure removed cause that is a BS statement,
Why no mention that at the time Venezuela was the wealthiest South American country it had a capitalist economy and a Democratic government It took Socialism less than 20 years to totally collapse the Venezuelan economy,
I dont know where this is going It was 976 inflation already then and now1000000,
No intervention in Venezuela no more bloodshed because of the oil reserves of Venezuela,

This happens if you relie so much on oil instead of spending the money on social welfare they should have spend the money on projects that will help the country in the longterm like funding companies that create jobs building infrastructure education and so on In the long term this would had the same effect This wouldve made the country richer where the goverment and most importantly its people would benefit of it  And they then dont have to relie on oil anymore i dont want to say that social welfare is bad but an system that is fully funded by oil and would break if oil prices drops like it happend in real life is stupid,

Time to add something to my anxiety list Thanks Vox,
We had a huge one coming for us but it missed us thanks to other planets with there gravitational force pushed it away but it was a while back like 1800 I think,
What if testing DART on Didymoon puts it on a collision course with earth,
Bruh i dont think it is gonna crash our earth _ Its 2019 Not 2017,
The gravity tractor is by far the coolest way to deal with the asteroid,
We Should Have Tracking Nuclear Missile You Can Control For The Rocks Thatll Be Spead After The Asteroid Blows Up,
Dont worry Ill just fly up to space myself and stop the asteroid in its track with my ginormous triceps,
is asteroid flat  yes bcs earth flat,
Well Dont look in the sky when that laser turns on and also NASA u would need a laser way more powerfull than even a 1000 mega watts,
NASA has the potential to save the human race and yet our country still puts the majority of the money on military,
Space  I have a monster asteroid Earth  NASA will save us LOL,
Lol dart made me think of dart from stranger things,
Oumuamua was massive and Nasa didnt even know it existed until it passed earth Long story short If this does happen Were boned We cant even see most of these things coming nevermind get a ship airborn in time to stop it,

Just keep your eye out for the NT7 asteroid It will mean doom to man kind if it hit us in 2019,
Yealast time I fell someone lit off a bottlerocket I was likewahhhhhh,
Im really scared of asteroids,
Just making sure humans will not go extinct like dinasours But if astroid hit moon we will meet our doomsday Just make sure angle between launch moon and astroid is not linear,
Im ready for NT7 on February 1st in 2 more days,
if we already have asteroids here why cant we just put them in a rocket ready to shoot at ANY MOMENT and when it shoots it will take down the huge asteroid,
no no no its to ez you got to think we should make DIDIMOON hit the astroid and it will become a planet duh,
What if we explored the sun at night so we dont burn,
So if thanos snaps would the meteor be destroyed in this case it would be good if thanos snaps,
That aint no meteor *_We are the meteor_*,
Since the Earth is flatit will only kill a few million people *Man Im glad I dont live on Earth*,

DO I SMELL STRANGER THINGS MUSIC,
Yay NASA will have a plan to save Earth Or maybe Mars,
The music was giving me such Stranger Things vibez,
kilotons and megatons arent units of energy,
Asteroides are immigrants They will just get deported,
What about the day after tomorrow,
We should build a wall so we can keep out the immigrants and asteroids,
So now Ill be paranoid about this for the rest of this week,
time to be paranoid for the next month,
John Holden is my personal hero,
WELP GOTTA SAVE THE MEMES,
Yall get ready for Bennu 2135,
Throw a Nokia phone at the meteor and it will desintegrate the meteor,
Why cant we just kindly ask it to go somewhere else,
Imagine theyd succeed into changing diddymoons direction but then it DOES hit earth,
How NASA plans to protect Mars from giant asteroids,
NNo thanks to god the god makes it move and nasa and jupiter Lol,
Just throw a Justin Bieber Album at it and the asteroid will revert its path,
The meteorite was like YAYEET,
give earth a chug jug well get a victory royale dont worry,
There is a project called DESTAR much better option than these ones in the video,
Kilotons and megatons are not units of energy they are unit measures of mass I think you mean kilo joules and mega joules,
we just gotta build a big trampoline,
There is a small chance Hasnt there been a ton of near misses,
I bet a bunch of mansplainers designed these defense programs,
The asteroids are just jealous that they couldnt become a planet so they want to spread their anger towards other planets,
520 LOVED the retro gaming asteroid graphics,
Omg I live near the Gulf of Mexico,
freakin mesosphere its supposed to protect earth from all these shitteroids,
enough foreplay hit us,
Space muffings,
COULD NASA SAVE NET NEUTRALITY,
The lady who was struck by a meteor had me really interested in space since 1990 when I saw it on a space encylopedia I wanted to become astronaut since then and guess what I am working in a hotel  Still very fascinated about space tho,
background music is maybe of stranger things,
This America Well just build a wall around that dirty brown asteroid,

W E N E E D T O B U I L D A C E I L I N G,
Flat Earthersthe earth is flat Asteroiduh ok,
We should use nuclear weapons to protect our earth from astroids,
When humans go extinct what kind of things will be next,
We take Earth and push it somewhere else,
Your homework will protect you paper beats rock think,
this vid was uploaded one day before my bday also i dont want to die,
Simply follow the Armageddon,
Honestly NASA is amazing hats off to them,
Do whatever it takes to save earth just dont send Matt Damon to outer space again,
Wat if day hit didymoon and deflect it TOWARDS earth,
It would be a shame if that dart thing actually made that asteroid go toward earth and extinct us all,
Watch Salvation on Netflix,
For the last time Africa is a continent not a country,
Just inject the meteor with ligma,
what if they try to push it away from earth but it gets accidentally pushed more towards earth,
The future we live on mars **using catapults to throw asteroids at earth** LOL NOOBS,
Its fake trust me people have been saying that for a long time but its never hit,
Hmm BACTERIO BOIS **no response**  **puts a fuckton of salt**  That will do the job,
Last time I was this early the US still supported NASA,
If for some reason someone wants to make a movie about anything space related Tom Hanks would be a great fit for John Holden,
What if by testing the battering ram we steer the asteroid towards us,
We should pull a Starkiller,
Im just gonna use bedrock,
There plan is to abandon us and move important people to mars,
Know that episode of magic school bus where they save earth from an asteroid,
The ending music was epic,
Jupiter The vacuum cleaner of the solar system,
God Needs to Move the Asteroids With Hes Hands Magic Hands,
We should just take the earth and push it somewhere else,
Just make a giant trampoline duh,
I have a idea making 35 satlites tat wod be lanct at thd astroide connect and use a solerpanes to power a ion thruster to push it out of its cores,
I think it would be cool cause everyone will go and panic mode and nobody can hide and then were all dead,
Dont worry Donald Trump will build a wall to protect us,
WTF just move Earths joystick,
Never A Straight Answer NASA,
Another quality video by Vox you all should get a show on TV I would watch it,
And then we all died The End,
We should build a wall,

"Just like a cat to feel like a humans significant other is a threat LOL But seriously I think Simon dodged a bullet when that girl ran off He deserves a lady whos not going to be too clothingproud on a date with a man whos got two cats That said I think in order to prevent more potential romances going awry perhaps Simon ought to play with his cats till theyre exhausted Then theyll sleep like the dead while the dates going on 

But thats just what Id do anyway",

Thats my MOOSE except he doesnt like pizza,
its good to see cats r silly the world over,
These videos make me miss my cat  I moved out from home since getting married but when I had food she would get up on my shoulder and eat my food as I brought it to my mouth lol,
I loved when Simons cat started grooming Kitten,
I like the cucumber reference so cute,
Jajaja Terrible Simn,
050 is my cat all the way,

Simons cat seems like the dad to the lil kitten love your videos too,
Great example of teamwork Hilarious when the kitten grabbed the last 2 bites from Simons plate,
Life of a pet owner ,
*Finally a video where Simon can at least have a taste of his own food*,
Aw Poor guy just wanted to enjoy his food in piece,
Guess he had to order fast food then,
I was really enjoying the video until he scratched the plate with his fork,
why is he eating thanksgiving alone,
The I have pets diet,
Simons cat doesnt even bother to ask Simon to feed him anymore He just takes Simons food,
A special for all the American fans of Simons Cat  cute,
Lol the beginning though where the cat is like Hey lemme join in the tasting of food ,
This was sooo cute Happy Thanksgiving everyone  also give your cat if you have one a really big hug ,
Poor Simon I feel your pain I have to lock the new kittens away in laundry room when I want to actually relax and enjoy a meal Otherwise I have to eat standing up in middle of kitchen Even then the littlest one will launch herself off something and attach herself to my back,
"This happens to me everyday






But my birb is the one to steal my food",
they even ate the sprouts,
Very cute  I would have given them their own portion first  Turkey is ok for cats to ear  I love the team work between both kitties Yes he is British but why not share in the American tradition  After all he must be thankful for his fur babies that share his home and his home and his heart Happy Thanksgiving,
no way how did Simon survived living with these cat,
Simon and my cat have too much in common,
Just went shopping and the car next to us had a sticker with Simons cat pointing to the gas tank for food and on the tank was his bowl 3,
Nicely done Im sure there will be any number of American households dealing with similar situations from today Thanksgiving Day through Sunday leftovers,
Happy Thanksgiving from Phoenix ,
"Will Simon EVER get to eat 
First No sandwich and now no dinner Poor Simon",
Thank you for thinking of us in the United States by releasing a special Thanksgiving video ,
no kitty my pot pie,
I can sense Cat apocalypse on the way,
Nicely done video Glad to see youre getting in the thanksgiving spirit today ,
I had a cat who would intercept the food on my fork on the way to my mouth,
I say 90 of the US can relate to this with some pet they mite have,
if thanksgiving was tuna steak instead of turkey it would become even worse with starving cats,
I saw only my cat,
Thanks guys for this It so happens I made myself some spicy beef last week and I think the cat ate half when I wasnt looking,
You made my thanksgiving day That was hilarious Well done,
"Every bite you take
Every snack you make
Ill be watching you",
It literally was  fast food ,
Who else enjoyed the video until they heard that squeaky plate noise ,
Finally a video where Simon can at least have a taste of his own food,
Sooo funny Loved seeing the kittens paw sneak in there,
"This was the first Thanksgiving without our cat and I kinda missed this  

Enjoy your pets while you can These moments are so special ",
Happy Thanksgiving Simon  your fur baby family,
Aww what a cheeky little team they make ,
While watching this my cat took my food ,
"Nice animation 
I really love your videos ",
Man its awesome how your animation has improved over the years,
Hilariously funny Simon really doesnt stand an earthly with the two of them They are so calculated they could rule the world,
I want the Kittyyyyy,
The only way to avoid this is to eat standing up holding your plate with one hand and your fork in the other It is important to be standing in the middle of the room where theres no furniture for the cats to climb on ,
Always a treat Thank you very much indeed Mr Tofield,
I should get cats like those so I can be skinny ,

Something like this happened to me I was trying to eat my dinner and while I was distracted by the new kitten my older cat snatched the chicken off my plate and ran off with it the kitten followed and I found them in the bedroom enjoying the drumstick lol,
My cat and Simon simply have too much in common,
Its hilarious that the kitten got that thing on its ear simon removes it carefully then the cat tries it too,

video was too long Halfway through it I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich But then I found out that Im out of mayonnaise so I went to a store There I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life But Im really a shy person so I took up a threeyear personality development course so I can introduce my self She was very friendly and all but unfortunately she has a boyfriend So I said all good Im a mature person I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend so I did not bother her anymore But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her Then she broke up with her boyfriend we drank some alcohol because of it I told her shell be fine and I wished her well I still think shes the most beautiful woman in the world but like I said I am over my crush on her It was like five seconds already when I first saw her Besides I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her It was more important than a crush So we kept hanging out drinking having coffee and all I had a girlfriend she started dating other guys My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it so I said okay I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately But we were really drunk so she spent the night in my apartment I only have one bed so you know what that means She took the bed and I slept on the couch But on the couch I really cant sleep Something was bothering me So I tossed and turned for about three hours then I finally cant take it anymore I stood up and went straight to my room where shes sleeping I approached the bed gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me She stirred and woke up She asked whats up I told her you know the first time I saw you I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video She said you know what Ive been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer So we opened that drawer and lo and behold theres my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it,
Thank you Simons Cat,
The best,
Finally a take on an old Sunday Garfield comic from about 30 years ago,
What is your life about your cat okay,
Simon cat is a very good puss,
"This is me The human
People like my moms food",
Thats really cute how Simon forgets about protecting his dinner completely and frets over the kitten having a clothing pin pinned to its ear,
That would be a set of dead catsslowly at that,
bello continua cos,
It Thanksgiving in America but for Simon its just a normal day of giving all his hard earned dinner to his cats unwillingly whilst they take it without saying so much as   thanks,

Aww  thats so cute,
That attention for the buttholes is truly art,
I can never watch a video with kitten in it without awing,
These are so great Next time Simon speaks listen carefully  he has a British accent,
Make more vids,
Teach me how to cat,
They should make this on tv as a mini short,
i Used To See This On TV,
What is this y is this 6th on trending ,
As i was watching this my cat knocked down my computer screen,
life lesson here Often better to be yourself,
I love simons cat ,
The reason new cartoons arent coming out is because Simons cat keeps unplugging the computer whenever Simon makes any progress,
Simon is probably one of the few channels on YouTube to get a pass for compiling and reuploading his old videos Afterall animation is difficult,
The people who clicked dislike meant to say disIlike And stop complaining about old videos the poor guy has to make the content by himself Animation is not a walk in the park Be grateful and just enjoy the genuis Love you Simons Cat 3 XD,
I love these videos All I can imagine is you meowing into a microphone for several hours Thanks for sharing your hilarious content  I really enjoy them ,
"Helpful hint
If the video is around ten minutes rather than just 13 its most likely a compilation
Conversely if it around 13 minutes it is probably a new video",
some old videosSimon does need a holiday although there is one task for Simon when being on holiday spending much more time taking care of his bossy cat than regular working days,
And thats why cat owners learn to live with the bathroom door open all the time,
Thank you for a 11 minutes NONSTOP SMILE on my face ,
As much as I love your old videos I look forward to new content We know it takes a long time to create new animations and Im sure we are all willing to wait a whole month for a NEW video,
SIMONS CAT IS THE BEST,
So funny Especially when the kitten started gesturing for something to eat  Classic Big cat looks around just as Simon disappears ,
"I love this  



PS Every single of your video is so true xD Sorry for bad English",
Simons cat has cuute jellybeans,
i understand the reason for compilations its insanely stupid how unsupportive youtube is of quality content but i think many people would appreciate if the compilations were titled accordingly as opposed to almost as if it were a new episode,
When I was 10 or 9 I would always look up your channel on my grandmas computer and watch your videos they r so cute I wish I had a cat but my dad is elergic to them and cant get one but I love your videos so much I still watch them ,
If my cat is ill he gets in there by himself to get to the vet ,
An entertaining way to catch up Dont always have time to watch all the vids Plus it gives my friends who had not known Simons Cat before the opportunity to enjoy Simons talent when I share the funny old and new vids with them Thanks a lot Simon  PS Gotta love the great sound effects,
Uploads have been more consistent over the last years And I would love to see the old Simons Cat Just animations no compilation no interviews no logic no behind the scenes Keep it simple,
My cat sounds so much like Simons cat He makes the same sort of sounds Just a very similar voice Hell also tap me on the shoulder with his paw to wake me up so Ill get his breakfast He even looks something like Simons cat  but hes thankfully nowhere near as destructive Enjoy your break,
Simons Cat is sure a determined one lol,
Owww i love your animations D and your cat x,
i LOVE simons cat,
A cat can do all this but not find his food ,
Cat always comes first  then its servant ,
I so relate to this,
You cat is SWEET,

"I use a top opening carrier thats top is transparent and curved Shaped like an old fashioned lunchbox I take it out and set it down The cat walks around it I grab him and put him in During the trip he either looks out or hides as he feels like Much easier than a front loading box 

The only problem is that it is VERY hard to find online The last time I had to replace it I ended up having to go to pet shops in person to look for it",

Im not asking for you to like this but youre still going to do it anyway,
"if simons cat in every vid was nyan cat

Doing compilations of old videos is one thing but giving it a title thats suggest its a brand new videotopic is just click bait tactics Shame,
I KNEW Simon was getting the carrier out before the reveal My cat does *exactly* the same thing legs on the edges and jumping away Its a big fight to the finish,
i was messing with Talking Angela an app that talks back to you and the cat suggested me this channel,

No joke while watching the computer skit my kitten decided to pounce repeatedly on the screen and in the process of walking on my keyboard somehow turned this page and my entire screen 90 degree clockwise I think that sketch is accurate XD,
Im looking at this and remembering my real experiences with my kitten from ages ago mainly the computer one,
I really think this animation would be more effective in color though,
This was so freaking cute The dislikes on this video arent cat people are they ,

"I love how you brought the cucumber bit into the cartoon i have watched so many cucumber cat videos
It was so funny
This is a true definition of my cat",
Nice cucumber reference,
these videos are sooooo much better if u actually have a cat,
I always assumed cats kept getting startled by cucumbers and it was the act of putting something unknown where it wasnt expected,
"Yes Simon actually won over his cOH NO

Thats what I expect from a Simons Cat short",
I love the cucumber role there D,
Its nice to see how much this shows style has evolved I love watching these ,
Cucumber 1  Cat 0,
Should I take it that the 31 people who thumbed down the video just dont like cats 42 million of us obviously disagree,
People comment before actually watching the video just to try to be first,
Aw the cucumber fell out and scared him Nice touch,
I cant decide which is funnier Simons laughter in 05x slowmo or the cats scared shitless LMFAO,
"Ha he added the cucumber thing
I dont regret refinding this channel by accident",
my cat loves to come and look at all the shopping and see if there is anything for him,
the end was so funny lol love this video cat makes me laugh,
Simon man youve gotta stop leaving your stuff unattended This is all on you now,
That cucumber got me laughing so hard D,
Oh Simon bless you for doing the cat and cucumber bit,
Haha the ending was brilliant,
I started laughing like simon when his groceries dropped out of the bottom of the bags,
Ive never seen a cat who doesnt trash shopping bags and their contents  haha,
That cucumber scene LMAO XD D D Brilliant cartoon D D,
Its so funny when a cat spit at 118 when he tried to open the box,
oh my gosh the cucumber  best part,
Some day Simon may learn  Even if he does his kitty will outsmart him,
So we should expect a dinner date on St Valentine,
Ive tried to scare my cat with a cucumber but it didnt work,
CLASSIC But my favorite part are those important cute cat pics on fridge,
Hi I Skytek I live in Russia in Chelyabinsk This is a very truthful film I do the same Like,

Came from RSS feed dated 20170210 1738 Clip showed properly in subscriptions tab didnt show on YT mainpage,
the cucumber  love an injoke,
Thats totally unrealistic theres no way you can fit all that into a bag especially if its not a reusable one,
I actually love the detail that the cat leaves the flowers largely untouched  I think everyone was probably expecting them not to survive the first couple of seconds Very nicely done,
You made me understand my cat betterThx for all your videos Simon you are a great artist,
Surely after all this time the guy wouldve chained his cat to the damn wall LEARN YOUR ANIMATORS ROUTINE DAMMIT,

My fat and sassy cat is unfazed by cucumbers sadly After seeing the halarious videos on YouTube I decided to see if he would react the same way I waited and put it on the floor behind him while he was eating and he turned around sniffed it then looked up at me like stupid human I cant eat that and sauntered off to go sun himself in the window He also isnt scared of the vacuum cleaner and will try to fight it which makes it hard to vacuum lol,
It took me a moment to realize what he was stepping on and then I began cackling,

my cat is so unbelievably fat and lazy that one time after I set my groceries on the dinner room table he didnt bother examining any of the food inside he just flopped over right on top of it and fell asleep after about 5 minutes of sleeping on my food he fell of the table along with my groceries he woke up then fell asleep again",

Coconbers the cats ennemies,
"During the cartoon i was like
Bah a real cat would actually try to eat the
Yep",
"When I was a kid we had a neighbor who moved away and was so irresponsible as to abandon five pregnant female cats We took them all in and they all delivered their litters within the same week We blocked off the largest room in the house and turned it over to the kittens for the most adorable chaos ever Our house was mostly an open plan house so we didnt have a door on the wide entrance to the den which was the largest room and instead blocked it off with a closet door that was taken off its hinges and laid on its side across the portal Well one particularly adventurous kitten whom I called Patches because he was white with gray spots learned how to get over that door and then taught the rest of them the trick So we got a sheet of plywood that was taller than the door had been wide They got over that So we got a new sheet of plywood that was so tall we had to cut a door into it like at an ice hockey rink and they still got over it Finally we topped it with plexiglass cementing the appearance of this room to a hockey rink and they couldnt get over that But they tried

Patches was also the first to learn how to climb the curtains First he got halfway and then mewed until someone got him down Then he got all the way to the top of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then he walked to the other side of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then the most worrying thing happened he stopped mewing because hed discovered the secret of how to slide down the curtains with his claws out One day I came into the den and saw him leading a line of six other kittens across the curtain rod all of them to end their journey the same way by shredding the curtains We kept them for six months until they could be weaned had them all neutered and given a checkout and then gave all but six away from approximately two dozen after personally interviewing each prospect Then we got rid of the curtains the carpet and replaced all the furniture It was horrendously timeconsuming and expensive but Im proud of my parents for not just leaving the pregnant cats or turning them over to a shelter",
i liked the video especially for the black cat that winked  That was more than adorable 3,
I have seven cats All fixed They act like brothers and sisters most of the time My dream is to be known as the neighborhood crazy cat lady,
"My uncle found a kitten in a bucket with water but he saved him His name is Graceson
Mother Presumably a tabby
Father 
My other cat Snowball took him in as her own kitten I love them both",
I watched a documentary about cats that showed why people in early days considered the cats to be evilOne of the reason for them to hate cats was because the female mated with several male cats to get pregnant and would have a single litter of kittens from different fathersThey termed this behaviour sinful and hence cats would get torturedI pity the fools who want animals to act like humans and have the same standard of loyalty and monogamyCats are cats not birdsdogs and horses etcRespect the individuality and treat every animal with the respect they deserve,
Last night I opened my door to find 3 cats other than my 1 cat sitting together Does anyone need anymore proof that my cat is the leader of a gang,
I think its funny how he actually draws the butt holes Lol that just kills me,
My cat Yoyo is actually a great father He took care of all the little kittens,
Poland loves Simons Cat ,
Love is something cats dont know Theyre here for your food,
absolutely love Simons cat please please please tell me me where I can get a Simons Cat toy like the ones in shot behind you thanks,
okay I will say I LOVE CATS AND DOGS,
I was just WAITING for the moment she ate the butterfly My kyou would eat bugs all the time in his younger days,
Cats DO love they just dont wear their hearts on their sleeves most of the time My Cindy spent 20 years telling me she loved me I was her kitten her special girl They form deep bonds of affection with humans for some reason as well as other animals But you have to be patient and give them time Dont rush them,
I wish good pets never died,
SimonsCatLogic one time my Cat called Sid brought me a mouse at 200 am into my room My brother and me searched 2 hours until Sid found the mouse Sid sat the whole time on the bed and wanted to go outside until the mouse made a noise Sid instantly jumped off the bed and 2 sec Later the mouse was dead I love sid But i never forgive him that night Believe me that was some midnight action ,
Cats are the most amazing and the most majestic animals ever ,
"18 months since the promo campaign for to the vet

Thank you for putting out the grand message on neutering and spaying pets  It is a huge part of responsible and loving pet ownership  Our local Humane Society even has a program for feral cat population control that includes catch and release  I have a feral feline that lives part time in my garden,

ya a lof cats fall in love sure and i love cats too,
sorry to say that but I dont understand a single word from the cat expert because of her accent and mumbling ,
For me it was love at first bite you ask the wife aka psycho vampire squid  I kid you not ,
That ADORABLE background of kittens at 238 3,
This one is so cuteone of my favorites ,
Some cats DO mate for life Take for example my neighbors cat and her stray boyfriend Its been years and they are ALWAYS together and when my neighbors keep her inside he will stay outside of their house for hours and meow hes even found ways of breaking in,
Hi as a bird person I just want to clarify most birds dont pair for life Some parrots and birds of prey do  penguins certainly do not despite the well known documentary  they may choose the same mate for a few years but then they may not Male birds are male and will essentially mate with anything that lets it and females will mate with the male with the flashiest plumage beautiful song or best nest The exception is in situations where teamwork is essential like birds of prey who have vast territories  in those situations they are monogamous Love your work Simon,
yes but cats are highly capable of bonding my two cats yin yang and quarts act like sisters ever since yin yang stayed while her sister were given away,
Adoro Simons cat Parabns a vc q inventou o Simons,

My friend wanted to take on a cat again and the woman that did the house visit basically just insulted everything about the house",

When she ate the Butterfly lmao,
OMG 20 000 kittenloveeeee,

Im a cat lover,
I see Simons Cat stuffies behind Simon when hes talking I want one,

I think it would be interesting to see a similar video that explains why cats do things like why they rub their cheeks against you why some cats arch their butts up in the air when you are petting near their tails why they present you with fresh kill trophies things like that",

"I had a wonderful cat Miss Kitty was his name I was 6 years old and the name stuck Behaviorally he acted like a female he would clean up after his brother Fat Cat when he refused to cover his waste in the litter box 

Glaring at Fat Cat the whole time as if saying You are nasty and many other weird mannerisms that reenforced the thinking that secretly Miss Kitty believed he was a girl

That cat slept on the same bed as me and pillow from the day I got him I had a lot of nightmares and he helped keep them away

I know Miss Kitty loved me as much as I loved him Sadly I dont think I will find another pet and friend as awesome as Miss Kitty 

Im 24 now and to my sorrow Miss Kitty passed away on the night before Thanksgiving last year I stay with him until he was gone He had gone blind earlier that night but he had already been deaf for a few years 

Miss Kitty saved me from my nightmares and made my life a lot better There was now way I was not going to let him pass on alone I loved him too much I know in my heart that Miss Kitty loved me too",

"Out of 63K comments you found mine

The girl in the blue shirt only knows the lyrics to the REALLY popular songs and then goes on to act like a super fan,
"Blonde girl What is this

Every bodys gamming out on Bohemian Rhapsody and then theres that one kid at 657,
Did we all search queen at the same time ,
112 That kid wanted me to end myself XD  The girl also said she loves queen but knew half of the songsXD,
423 the little kid is so precious,
Your parents are raising you right Sydney,
We will always have someone in these videos we will always hateALWAYS,
Queen is one of the best bands of all time,
When I heard I want to break free I was like ROGERINA  like I STAN too much ,
"i screamed every time I saw hate
in other words my throat hurts",
Ok girl in the blue shirt knows what good music is and gives me hope for these young people,
112 That was a boring song DONT SAY THAT LISTEN TO THE WHOLE SONG THIS IS QUEEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT,
Mam LIFE has just begun and now Ive gone a thrown it all away,
That little girl with the light blue shirts is amazing so educated about a band thats from her parents maybe grand parents time,
That one point the blond one was like you wanna break free youre already free and I literally laughed so hard and I dont know why lol,
Really  The Kid actually said Beyonc the queen of auto tune is a better vocalist than Freddie Mercury Poor sheltered children,
Sydneys parents are raising her right,
knowing that Queen was from my country  England  is such a pleasure knowing that they have grown through the past 20  30 years without the band not together anymore is actually legendary,
"*waves arms frantically*





QUEEN",
Everybody start at 635 and put it to 2x times speed,
If that Blondie girl was my daughter I would give her to another family,
the 6 year old does not like  QUEEN SHE US CRAZY,
903   WTF ,
They didnt know the we will rock you is from Queen,
Sydney and the boys are having the time of their lives,
The blonde girl that kept complaining is going to grow up to be the lady that asks to speak to your manager lol,
queen is one of those bands that you have to love because their range of creativity is so unique that they include sounds from all genres such as classical rap rock rb etca lil something for everyone,
there already is her name is Beyonce XDDDDD,
You need to get Brian May and Roger Taylor to react to this so badddd If you get deaky the world will explode,
The blonde girl needs some serious therapy,
They will never understand the beauty and best era of music *QUEEN*,
Freddie may now be reborn,
721 When BR finally possessed him ,
Sydney is the best kid Ive ever seen ,
My favorite one is the girl in the blue shirt,
"To the blue tshirt girl 
You are a legend 

We are all legends",
Why do I feel like slapping that ONE kid whos complaining about everything,

659 Its a masterpiece darling ,
The girl in the blue knows where its at,
OMG FREDDIE MURCURY IS RHE GRETEST ARTIST AND QUEEN IS THE BEST BAND,
627 *HOW CAN YOU SAY THIS YOU LITTLE TRAP LISTENER*,
I feel like there are already singers who can match Freddie Mercury in just singing ability but I dont think well ever have someone who matches Freddie as a performer and songwriter He just had something special you cant recreate that,
You can definitely tell which parents are raising their kid right,
"That girl didt like bohemian rhapsody 
Whttttttttttt",

740 thats how it be sometimes when you listen to queen,
615 try to make a meme out of this,
that little blonde girl needs to leave,
When Lucas says radio GA GA was boring all Queen says disgrace,
I need a daughter like Sydney ,
Brian May rocks the world apart with his guitar,
624 I WILL hunt u down and shoot you u little,
The little girl who said Freddie is her fav artist her parents raised her so amazingly and the guys parents who said Beyonc is better they failed as parents,
Hope my daughter is as cool as Sydney Freddie Mercury is a god  Lmao bless that child,
658 when you get high for the first time,
627 nobody cares Its a great song and you have your own opinion It is one of the greatest songs of all time and now Im mad,
I want my kid to be like blah blah blah girl She knows that freddi and queen is awesome,

Me *tries to rewind the video and gets an unskippable AD* thats not part of the challenge right I was doing so well too,
I just realized that Brandon reminds me sooo much of the Cheetah cop from Zootopia anyone else see it,
omg the brandon guy stayed positive the entire video and it actually made me so happy,
Wanna make me mad Show me a video of a lets play of a game that I played before and they do something wrong thats so obvious,
Did yall throw an unskippable add in there for the sake of going with the try not to get mad challenge,
The only thing that got me mad in this video was the 30 second ad,
thats gonna be hard considering im a *giggle* very angry *giggle* person *giggle* *giggle*,
The pancake one will never stop bothering me,
Ill be honest when the ball bounced out of the prize slot I may have flipped off my laptop,
"Rickrolled on 2017


That Is Something We Must Be Proud Of

NEVER GONIG TO GIVE YOU UP NEVER GOING TO LET YOU DOWN,
Why were they mad at the last one,
Dionte is so cute awww,
brandon makes me so happy he has a awesome personality,
"There is nothing to be mad except



Read more",
So on Valentines Day my High School had confess your love for a dollar during lunch No joke you would literally pay a dollar to have some choir kid sing a segment of a love song to a person of your choice and they sometimes sang that song that was in the last video,
This reminds me of the the kids I see in college  As a wellseasoned  college freshman I love how they are so innocent yet get so upset at little things,
"Things I learned from this video Morgan Beau  Adam are naturally very angry people 
KennedyDionte Brandon  Jasser love Never Gonna Give You Up as much as I do",

I love rick astley Like if you do too XD,
Im glad that there are more people in the public saying that they like JarJar Binks Hes only bad if you never grow up As George Lucas said its a film for 12yearolds,
Try not to hang yourself while watching this video,
"If anyones interested in how claw machines are rigged heres some interesting factoids
Claw machines are designed to slowly grab tighter over a certain number of goes So say its set to a 30go cycle after 30 goes the claw will grab as tight as it ever grabs and this is usually when people win After that it will slowly get weaker before getting stronger again on another 30go cycle So if you can watch people play a claw machine for long enough you should be able to work out how long the cycle is based on when people win and then you can work out the best times to play to win

Or you could actually enjoy your life and just play it straight away and if you dont win you dont win",
Brandons hands are soooo tiny lol,
anyone in school in 2017 knows nothing but rap music and it pisses me off,
Im a Very Angry Person *Starts Giggling*,
dionte seems like the dopest dude,
Why does everyone get mad at the rickroll song,
I danced to Rick Astley,
"I literally started dancing when the last one came up
And it was satisfying seeing everyone get mad too",
Next time you guys should put a gif of a never ending load screen as the last video haha,

Jaxons chair spin at the end Same dude Same,
The youngest one plays the oldest song Neat,
"905 i like everyones choice its really cute except  jaxons 
 Jaxon no one can beat take on me 
This vid is hilarious",
When Jaxon is such an idol at 14,
Jaxon has awesome taste in music His parents definitely raised him right,
If this was me I would be Reacting like jaxon and losing instantly,
Someone get Jaxon a record The boy can sing,
"My fav song is




 bellie jean is not my lover aughh",
Jaxon literally picked the only good song,
Jaxon is the younger but he choosed the better song by far,
The little white boy did it savagely,
TEENS REACT TO FINESSE BY BRUNO MARS AND CARDI B,

JAXON I CANT,
Jaxons a teen now,
"Jaxson on everyone elses song

The way they dont really care about the challenge,
Jaxon is so cute lol,
THAT JAXON KID MADE ME SO HAPPY OMG HES SO ADORABLE AND HE HAS GREAT MUSIC TASTES YES,
Jaxon has good taste in music,
Im surprised a 14 year old would recommend that song lol,
Its hard to believe that the youngest one has the best music taste,
Jaxon  you gained my respect  you little mouse That was the only song i liked great taste 3,
Whooaaaaa Jaxons song was lit Did anyone notice that jaxon actually could sing it O You got some pipes lil bro You made me like this song a whole lot more now that was some genuine rocking out 3,
"At the beginning I was like
Oh its just going to be rap and pop this will be easy

At the end

Freaking accurate Jaxon Take on Me is just the best,
my man jaxon out here reppin the 14 year olds,
I WANTED TO SCREAM WHEN I SAW THE SONG JAXON PICKED I KNOW ALL OF THE WORDS TO IT AND ITS SUCH A BOP,
Jaxon graduated from the kid with the good music taste to the teen with the good music taste ,
Jaxon was like *Its my turn to shine*,
I seriously dont ike the music of Cardi B idk whats the hype about,
"Kpop fans be like

*I WOULDVE REQUESTED KPOP*",
Jaxon honestly has the best taste of music,
"Me at the the beginning this is the weakest sh*t I beat literally every competition they have
Take on me Goooooooooooooooooosh dammit You actually got me",
So bobbing your head or moving to the music is classed as singing and so you lose the challenge,
"Yeah Rae
*cuts to Rae*",
Jaxon is already on Teens React JEEZ THESE KIDS GROW UP FAST,

She looks like shes going to murder those kids lol,
i love the fact that she knows all of her videos ,
im expecting for natural reacting but nah she wont do that,
did anyone else come here to see if she would act in character or nah,
I FELT LIKE SHE WANTED TO LAUGH WHEN KIDS WERE REACTING LIKE WTH THATS CREEPY I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES,
I thought she is going to be normal in this video,
She showed no EMOTION WHAT SO EVER ,
wtf poppy I thought I would see her react but instead she just repeated her self and didnt say anything,
I want to know how shes in real life,
I thought there would be a jumpscare at the end,
Kids react to poppy reacts to kids reacts to poppy,
next kids react to poppy reacts to kids react to poppy,
DONT WORRY ITS SAFE HERE IN THE COMMENTS,
the creepiest part was how she was saying everything in the video in unison with the video,
Its creepy how she knows all the words,
shes like speaking perfectly with the video,
So creepy how she knows every line,
Does she remember everything she says in those video Is that even posible,
shes watching her own video instead of kids reaction XDDDDD,
Videos are creepy but I have to be honest she seems like a very elegant and pretty lady,
wtf she can memorize every note wtf just wtf,
What in the hell did I just watch,
These are some smart kids poppy what are you doing to my emotions,
her talking along with the video JESUS,
They would be even freaked out if they saw this,
is poppy human,
Poppy is the reason things go missing in the Bermuda Triangle,
The FBI needs to be informed about poppy,
Whats really creepy is her saying each video word for word,
I feel so bad for the people that had to film this thatd be so uncomfortable,
how does she even remembers her own lines can she record it,
"Is this the krusty krab

No this is poppy",
Poppy in the first video said her name 666 times THE NUMBER OF THE DEVIL,
does she watch her videos over and over how does she know what to say with 0 mistakes,
She honestly looks just like a doll in this video,
"I dont even know what to think of Poppy anymore 
Imma just go to sleep


And have nightmares


About poppy",
I think its so amusing in some parts that if you notice closely shes about to burst into laughs Especially at some point when a kid said something and she smiled,
She looks less like a ghost on this channel,
My favorite part was watching her smile when the kids got the meaning of the video awwweee,
You can see she was kinda laughingsmiling if you look closely ,
The fact that she knows every word in every video that theyve shown is s c a r y,
I want her to break character so bad,
how does she remember exactly what she says at the exact time in her videos,
She doesnt even react Wtf,
"Poppys facial expression never changes Its just blank They caled her a psychopath a creep and her reaction is     




 
Im Poppy",
I wonder what shes REALLY like,
I wont sleep this night,
Now have the kids react to poppys reaction,
even in FBE she still acts mysterious,
The creepiest react episode ever,
she looks soooo robotic how does she know every video,
GOD THIS IS SO UNSETTLING AND UNCOMFORTABLE,

Poppy is an amazing actor She doesnt even move her face when the children talk about her She resembles a doll so much its crazy,

i admit I thought wed have a jumpscare at the end,
Can you do a Poppy reacts to all the theories about her mostly the creepy onesThanks ,
Now you should do a kids react to poppy reacting to kids reacting to poppy,
"its creepy when it says

I came on the video thinking finally I can hear how she talks and then she repeated everything I was SHOOK ,
"The end is CREEPY 




HERE IS SOME FOOD STAY HERE 






THERE ARE NO JUMP SCARES",
PLZ DO KIDS REACT TO POPPY REACTS TO KIDS REACT TO POPPY,
For me Poppy looks forced to do that Moriah the actress of poppy looks like she didnt want to imitate herself and she wanted to say her opinion She couldve really said some words and the end was way too creepy for me_,
I LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THE SCRIPTS OF THE VIDEOS ITS SO GREATTT,
she looks like she has no emotions,
u have to admit that poppy is super pretty,
For some reason I wanna watch more wtf confirmed,
wtf she remembers everything on the video im creeped out,
she dosent have a reaction sheshes just repeating the lines she knows,
She sounds like the weird twins from The Shining,
"does anyone get the feeling that poppy 
is a robot ",
"is she robot 
this is scared me ",
But like is she even reacting,
This is kinda creepy but i love how cute she is,
she is holding her laughter,
woah the way she was talking along scared me,

Shed make a killing if she became a professional poker player because thats one hell of an inscrutable face,
im a kid and i think she is creepy,
"How can she stay like that
my god shes amazing",
Are the Fine Brothers alive after this,
shes the illumanati really,
Probably the most interesting artist alive today,
The creepy thing is that she never reacts to the kids reacting to herCREEPY,
I feel like there is a jumpscare 443,
OH MY GOD Poppy us freaking me out ,
okay lets just ignore the fact that she is a lil bit scary But she can remember all of her scrips thats dedication,
Poppyinception,
at least she is pretty,
This woman is a genius,
its weird seeing her in a different setting,
Its terrifying how in sync she is with her own video,
i feel like shes gonna murder all those kids now ahahha,
its terrifying how she talked in sinc with herself,
im scared she remembers exactly what she says in like every video,
WTF,
she doesent even breathe like she doesent moves she just blinks is she a robot or something,
did anyone notice that she barley blinked ,
she has no emotions,
Man the actorfor Poppy is great at her job,
This is scarier than her actual videos I feel sick in a scared kind of way,
She didnt react,
Poppy should react to kids react to poppy reacts that kids react to poppy,
robot programmed to talk specific lines when hearing the background music of certain vids,
Poppy1 way to traumatize children LMAO,
She is definitely mentally disturbed,
Do people at least know poppy is just a character If you do a little bit of research poppy is a project created by Titanic Sinclair even without research if you think it JUST A LITTLE BIT you realize that  she is a character Common guys it is pretty obvious,
Im plant,
You should do kids react to poppy reacts to kids react to poppylike if you agree,
I feel bad for poppy  because she looked sad while she was hearing the kids opinions,
She is sort of like a robot The way she just sat and stared at the video made me creeped out And like she could say every single word from all the videos,
I searched for a piece of soul inside her I couldnt find any,
Poppy is creepy,
HOW THE HELL DID SHE REMEMBER ALL THAT,
Its the illumanti,
At parts it looked like she was about to laugh pahahhahaa,
I still feel like it would have been more interesting to have teens react to Poppy than kids,
do you know what an reaction means this video should be named Poppy watching kids reacting to Poppy,
"Poppy is gorgeousz
 Sure she may be weird Unsettling Creepy
But shes beautiful",
I thought she was like gonna laugh and stuff but no,
Poppy looks so perfect omg,
Shes gorgeous its just a shame how weird her YouTube channel is,
internet people reaction to poppy reaction to kids reaction to poppy,
wtf did i watch,
Poppy  ASMR  My Life,
How the hell dose she memorized the lines in the videos,
I was laughing when she was repeating everything,
She looks angry I find it a little strange so she knew every line she said from the video she acts just like a robot I think shes purposely trying to creep people out,
"OMG we know her name is







Scarlett",
i love how she knew what was next or all the words,

Dig the fact that she has all of her videos memorized,
You should do Kids meet Poppy in real life,
When Poppy talks over herself it sounds like shes a forest witch in an abandoned murder house eeeeuuuuuuu chillye,
the way she remembers everything omg,
I was obviously asking for too much when I said Hey maybe shes gonna be normal this time,
KIDS REACT TO POPPY REACTING TO KIDS REACT TO POPPY,

I understand what shes trying to doi like her messages,

I think Kofi didnt understand how this challenge works,
the under taker would destroy this,
Im canadian we know comedy  Chris Jericho 2016,
Did Someone Forget To Tell Kofi That He Wasnt Supposed To Laugh,
I love how Jericho and Lana stay in character xD,
For some reason I knew Chris Jericho would win,
Lana keeping kayfabe alive in the 2010s,
Fine Brothers you know what happens when you try to challenge Jerichos ability to hold his laughter Huh You know what happens clicks pen,
Rusev breaking character is just wonderful,
Rusev  seems like a cool guy out of character,
Jeez Lana keeping it going with the Russian accent,
If you think about it rusev seems like a nice guy,
When you realize Lana is more of a man than Rusev,
I love how Lana stays in character and rusev doesnt,
john cena is in this video you just cant see him    ,
JERICHO YOURE ON THE LIST,
And Jericho continues to be the best in the world at what he does Do you understand What Im saying to you Right now,
Rusev is such a great guy in real life,
Lana keeps faking her accent lmao,
Alicia is soo cute and rusev and seth seem to be really nice guys,
LMAO Roman giggles I was breathing Funny thing is I would give the same excuse,
Im Canadian we know comedy HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA lmao,
where did titus laugh,
MOOOOOOOOOORE MORE SUPERSTARS PLS,
What was on Sheamuss head,
this shows that rusev is a good man with a good heart lol,
Kofi wasnt even trying lol,
Kofi thought this was a try to laugh challenge,
imagine Undertaker doing this,
Rusev actually seems like a pretty chill guy,
I liked their real personalities more than their wwe personas,
Rusev is like the nicest person of em all D,
beating Lana is better than winning championship belt haha,
Vince McMahon I dont care if Roman laughed he won Dammit,
I wouldve loved if Lana broke character since Rusev did but I loved thos,
I knew Jericho would win because he is best in the world at what he does,
Rusev is actually really nice,
Jericho invented this game,
There is John Cena in this Video but you cant see him,
i want brock lesnar aj styles stone cold in this,
More of the WWE Superstars Please Alicia Fox me made LMAO ,
Titus didnt smile,
Jericho has no emotions,
why is Roman so relatable,
alright lana u taking your jobs too serious,
YOOO TITUS GOT ROBBED SO BADLY ITS A TIE,
I think I laughed more at the wrestlers messing up than the actual videos xD,
they sould of but the undertaker,
"I love how Lanas in character even using the same accent 
I didnt see Titus laughing though I think the judging on this contest wasnt the best",
rusev laugh that was so funny,
Rusev breaks character and Lana stays in character,
John Cena was there We just couldnt see him,
Kofi is note even trying XD I think he forgot about the challenge,
John Cena was there too you just couldnt see him,
Rusev laughed at a joke my WWE life is a lie well,
This side of rusev is hilarious,
Loved Jericho and Lana keeping kayfabe and the fact that Roman cant even do this right,
Roman Reigns is bae ,
Lana doesnt break kayfabe except for total Divas,
YOUTUBE WILL NEVER EVER EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVEEERR BE THE SAME AGAAIN,
Kofi didnt understand the challenge xD,
props to lana for staying in character,
I think kofi thought this challenge to be try to laugh at every video,
Can you do a more wwe superstars reaction videos please I have some names for you that maybe good  John Cena Dean Ambrose  AJ Styles    Luke Gallows Karl Anderson Kevin Owens CesaroDolph Ziggler Brian Corbin Goldust and RTruth,
I love to see the soft side of tough people this is so pure,
Now lets see them put Dean Ambrose and Bray Wyatt in one of these,
the dude actually looks like erick rowan when titus said thaat looks like a bit of sheamus,
Great Unless its funny We need minds like this,
Jericho was determined,
I always win Im Rusev,
Is tat a tattoo or hair on Sheamus saying LAOCH,
"Fine Brothers  Do you know what happens when you try to make Jericho laugh Do you know what happens 



You just made de list D",
Kofi didnt understand the rules of the game,
"You done messed up monkey

D",
And the winner is Y2J because those stupid idiots in those videos failed to make him laugh and so they just made the List,
John cena react to John Cena vine compilation v,
OMG Lana is adorable tbh all of them are so cute,
If jericho could win his matches just like this challenge,
Jericho is the man Legend,
Im Canadian we know comedy ,
Titus got robbed,
Was waiting for the smile of Jericho,
jericho proved  he is real best in the world,
Love how jericho stays in chracter,
You wanna know what you get for trying to make Jericho laugh  Huh  YOURE ON THE LIST ,
Lana stays character the whole time while Rusev just break all of his,
"I was with them and laughed at all the videos
Like always you cant see me 
NeverGiveUp",
lana sounds like tinka from shake it up,
The smile of Jericho You aint gonna see it maaannnnn,
Rusev is a nice guy Actually such a sweet guy,
Lana says  Rusev always beats me do u want me to call the police for u lana,
Damn Jericho and Lana are probably real fun at parties,
I like how Rusev isnt in character but Lana is lol,
Titus didnt lose,
A part of me was hoping the Seth Rollins laugh was his real laugh,
lmao Jericho is too muchtough luck kid thats what you get for walking around dressed as a ghost Honestly never mind the videos Jericho was the funniest here,
Im Canadian we know comedy  Chris Jericho 2016,
Jericho give the Best answers ,
"Roman Reigns Im a bit of a giggler






MIND BLOWN",
you should get Stone Cold out there hell never laugh,
I know Rusev is quite cheerful when he sees funny stuff like this but everyone knows he cant beat Lana,
I was hoping for Seth Rollins to do his satanic laugh thank you whatculture,
kofi just laughs and laughs and laughs lol,
"Jericho Im Canadian I know comedy
well go ahead tell me a joke
if you dont make me laugh then Ill take that list of yours and throw it at ya
then Ill let Rollins take it and throw it at ya",
Foxy is so gorgeous 3,
Oh my God we want more of this,
I love Chris jericho,
"How do you think youre gonna do

Lana Great unless its funny",
jericho is the best and you know it,
Titus elimination was sooo unfair,
Bruh I cant take Lana seriously since shes in total divas and I know she has an American accent,
Most of these superstars are from raw,
Everyone thought it was Dean Ambrose WTF XD,
NO RKO VINES,
I laugh when Roman Reigns got eliminated cause hes using funny excuses but he keeps get eliminate lol,
Jericho is GOAT and if you dont believe that then YOU JUST MADE THE LIST,
Lana is a straight up savage,
thank God for wwe,
the undertaker would do great at this,
Amazing video just it should be renamed to WWE Raw Superstars how come there were no Smackdown Live Superstars Aj Styles or Dean Ambrose would be incredible in videos like these,
I want them to react to the John Cena meme lol,
omg Roman i love it hahaha,
you should get the undertaker in one of these,
you did smile lana,
Easy win for Y2J  Im Canadian  we know comedy xD,
"Thats my treat right there I like watching people laugh and theyre WWE superstars too I need more of this
Also Alicia Fox is cute as hell here",
Jericho is the best in what he is doing,
I can believe SHEAMUS AND SETH ARE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER,
Rusev had the best laugh,
I always win Im Rusev I loved that,
For Sheamus what does it say on the side of his head,
Rusevs laugh is so great  Him and Lana both laughed or smiled at the kid running into the door  Theyre going to be really great parents some day no joke,
THE GOAT ALWAYS WINS DRINK IT IN MAN,
HonestlyLana is a lil **** Alicia was like she had the best reaction P,
Lana sounds exactly like the female guards from skyrim lmao,
I knew kofi and Roman werent gonna last long lmfao but Sheamus thoooooo,
Lanas dedication to kayfabe is impressive,
According to Bulgarian tradition I am the boss in the family wait whaaaat ,
love the wwe ones keep them coming,
Stone Cold Steve Jericho,
kofi thought it is try to laugh,
This video made me love RuRu even more,
This laught challenge was impossible Reactors should do this,
When sheamus said this is definitly me in the winter i cracked,
Once again Jericho proves he is above these neophytes,
none of this is funny thats why Jericho is the best,
Jericho Lana and Titus are hard to crack,
Need more wwe in this show,
This makes me so happy just because if Sheamus Seth and Roman,
Lana keeping kayfabe like a boss,
Rollins reaction to the monkey vid ,
Picture Paul Heyman on this video,
You guys are trying to make me laugh with foolishness  Titus ONeil,
As soon as I saw Y2J in the lineup I knew it was game over for the others His poker face is the best,
"Lana this is real smile 
Bruh u just smiled",
Koi laughed the most because he has a happy going personality,
"I always win  Im rusev 
Yea unless your jobbing then sure",
omg they should do more,
Jericho proving why hes the GOAT,
John Cena reacts to are you sure about that meme,
Y2J is the best in what he do for real,
you should contact the cast of suicide squad and see if theyll do this,
This is great I cant believe most of their weaknesses against laughing are babies D,
Like usual Jericho is GOAT,
"I WANT MOREEEE
I NEED MORE 
Do another one pls 3",
Jericho maintaining kayfabe hats off,
"Oh of course Jericho hes seen it all
ouch lmao",
Was John Cena there I dunno man I didnt see him,
They probably cut Jerichos smiles otherwise he would have put them on the list,
Jericho is the best with his sarcastic comments,
did anyone notice that all of these Superstars are in raw,
"Jericho is a Stone Wall

I dont understand how these kids cant figure out which button turns the computer on That hasnt changed at all in the passed 20 years,
No wifi what Its a desktop PC You stick an ethernet cable in there which is still superior to wifi,
like wtf You still have a computer and a monitor Why would you try to turn on the computer pressing the button on the monitor That part hasnt changed a bit,
kids these days dont even know how to turn on a computer,
Windows 95 Im still on windows 10,
i have some extra bleach if anyone wants,
so much pain and cringing in this video damn,
The ignorance in this its too strong,
Did he just ask what a modem is,
Pre historic Really It was only 21 years ago girl chill,
What is a modem Thats not an issue of age thats an issue of stupidity,
I was born in 2002 and know what Windows 95 is,
207 No 95 as in 1695,
I once turned off Windows 95 when it wasnt safe it transformed and ripped my legs and one eyeball out,
those teens are kinda triggering me,
Prepare in a near future when your kids asking you to tell What was a Galaxy S7,
whats a modem arrh my ears,
My school still has this computer,
Windows 31 was more significant for desktop computing than Windows 95 These teens are just computer illiterate,
"Wait whats a modem 

That got me",
The human race is finished,
i had the Windows 95 when i was a kid,
"Whats a modem




i thought home users still used modems",
they CANT seriously be this oblivious can they the majority of schools used windows 95 up until they absolutely had to change,
where do they get those kids from under dwayne johnson,
"345 wait what is a modem r u freaking keeding me
I dont wanna live in this galaxy anymore",
Im 14 and I used Windows 95 when I was young,
That moment when you still own your windows 95 computer,
Wow These kids grew up middle class you can tell My family had to deal with this kind of stuff until 2009 We couldnt afford to upgrad to wifi We had AOL and Dial Up on a Windows 98 computer for most of my childhood,
Started using my computer with WinXP Still know how DOS operates But THIS is just ignorance,
Back in my day You werenta man unless you can operate MSDOS,
We still have modems FFS,
Jesus Christ can they actually chose some intelligent teens to ask questions to,
north american kids,
how do you get online without wifi LMAO if you know what wifi actually means you wouldnt say that lol Im sure almost everyone does but this girl surprised me lol,
Do kids get dumber,
We still use modems today and a lot of them didnt even know what one is,
That moment when a phone goes near the computer and it goes eeeeeeeee Or is it just me,
"133MHz What is this 1995   



Oh wait",
i like the booting sound when theme song coming so chilling,
they cant even tell monitors and computers apart lol but we still use both so thats kinda weird,
Looking at this feel like this generation has everything given to them on a silver plate,
I use windows 95 cause im a edgy teenager,
These have to be the most tech illiterate teens alive,
I still had these in primary school and that was only from 20032010,
Modern day teens are basically imbeciles,
They need a new set of teenagers tbh,
At first when I clicked the video I was like why does this have so many diss likes then I watched the video and figured it out,
"Thank you for making me feel old
I was born in 93 and you called Windows 95 Ancient and Prehistoric 
Thanks fam",
I was born in 95  I knew Window 95 though ,
"I dont care what anyone says Im nearing 16 and I _love_ using Windows 95

Ill bet you theyll consider making a follow up called _Elders React to Windows 10_",
what about Netscape Remember that,
"what is a modem

Seriously Come on brah",
"my teachers use these in some classes 







damn u school xDD  kids use chrome books xD ",
Anyone remember MS DOS,
"WiFi routers still have to be connected to a modem

What are kids doing these dayswhen I was their age I could build websites",
This was my first computer as a child and Im only 16 ,
I dont blame these kids for not knowing how to work the technology works but to be so clueless about its evolution is offputting,
18 yo american teens not knowing LAN way to go America,
Monitors have separate power buttons here in 2016  Unless youre using an iMac,
"A Dell






Not Adele      Badum tish",
They failed at technology not knowing the difference between a monitor and the computer,
why are these guys so clueless,
I was born 5 seconds ago and i know what Windows 95,
Windows 95 was distributed on a single CD as well,
What is a modem Seriously Computers still use them,
These kids are talking from *2216* and thats why they have no clue about Windows 95 and pcs back then  After all who would guess you *physically* need to press a button to turn a pc on,
wtf I was born in 1996 and I had one of those for years I remember using that computer at school in 2002 Im not much older than this kids so,
kids react to brazzers,
 Its A Dell not the singer Adele but A Dell LOL,
I actually used this in 1600 BC when I was 3,
Do you even 95 bruh,
They dont even know anything about DOSWhen I first use it I feel like Im in the matrix,
Surely PCs still have separate on buttons for the tower and the monitor,
You have to save this video and show it to the viewer for teens react to windows 10 in 2036,
Shouldnt they know about these Im 19 and I remember these,
Let them react to Commador 64,
Computers i grew up with,
What They are older than me And when I was 4 I can easily turn on our pc all by myself,
Teens react to Metallica,
its a dell not Adele the singer its a dell XD,
Windows 95 was a revolation in its day When I was about 10 I was using a Commodore Vic 20 it had 35k of ram and had to load stuff from a cassette tape A 2kb programme would take 15mins to load,
Surprise developers still use DOSlike Linux interface today to configure servers and NEARLY everything on the server side,
i was born in 1993 and remember my aunt having this,
They are going on about the computer not having wifi but both of my pcs dont use wifi they connect directly to the modem,
Iam younger than some of these lads and still remember how to use this computer D,
Im younger than all of these kids but i know what a modem is,
I was born in 2016 and even I know what a modem is,
Did they really press the power button on the monitor and thought it would turn on the computer That show that they obviously know nothing about computer,
Teens react to ricegum,
what about the macintosh that was before 95,
Im only about 57 years older than these kids and this makes my head hurt,
they cant blame their age for their ignorance All the stuff they mentioned is still used today Except floppy disk maybe,
im alot younger than all of these teens and I grew up with windows 95,
A few of those kids are almost my age they should know what windows 95 is Lol,
pffff show them an amiga 500,
* Grabs second snack * LMFAOOO,
win 95 felt like space technology compared to loading games on my sinclair spectrum zx,
Im 49 and cant figure out an iPad,
"For me though this is the first computer ever made
THE ORDER OF MAKING DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOU WOMAN D",
Im 15 and I can perfectly remember these oo,
OK guys whos been there long enough to remind AMIGA,
Oh those were the days lol My first computer my family had was a Macintosh Performa 275 and the first PC we had was a Dell too with Windows 98,
Their lack of GK is painful,
Thhis teens only use facebook  so WTF,
95 As  in 1995 NO AS IN 2095,
I was born in 2018 and I know what modem is,
How would they react to Windows 31,
some of these teens are at same age as me however they are so naive i am not saying it only for this video but most of the videos,
336344 Really ,
my brother is 3 and he knows what a modem is,
Wait wait wait They heard of Windows 95 but not a modem Modems are still used and improved  and Windows 95 is left behind,
336 LMFAO,
did you really ask whats a modem,
Scary how spoilt and dependant they are on current simplicity It was fun to use and figure out the intricacies of dos,
these kids dont realize modems are still around  Im probably at the most 5 years younger than the oldest teen on this show and I have two modums in my house,
336 whhhhaatttshgmsdhgsdghs,
These teens  More like kids,
Teens react to Tis wouldve made more sense if it were kids,
Typical uncultured American teenagers,
im happy with windows 7,
Windows 31 or GTFO,
What no audio on the computer They missed the most glorious part of Win95 the music it plays when the OS loads,
i started on windows 95,
que imbciles,
This brought back painful memories,
We had it from 1st class to 5th grade  So from 2008  2012 And I am from Norway,
516 not Windows 1 Windows Version 101,

According to Steven King the it wakes up every 27 years The first movie was released in 1990 and the remake will be released in 2017 27 years later,
My brother said that the end where the clown comes out of the water is like When Ronald McDonald hears youve been going to burger king I Laughed so hard at this whole trailer,
IT makes The Joker look like a tellie tebbie,
"clownI have spicy memes down here
me *slides down gutter*",
I remember when clowns were actually for comedy,
"I love my child but if he said Youll float too well I dont have any children anymore  

MEEEE",
301 Well I dont have children anymore,
Did people know that pennywise attacked the town every 27 years the photos the kids saw in the new trailer were based on events from the movie 27 years ago,
Doesnt the clown return every 27 years in the book The last move came out in 1990 its 2017 27 years later,
The new clown is obviously evil dark and creepy The 90s clown looks more like a regular clown he can even look like a nice guy simply dressed up and the fact that you could believe someone was all nice and then turn into such a monster is way scarier than seeing something dangerous and knowing you dont get near it,
"cool fact

Pennywise haunted the main character every 27 years
first movie realized on 1990
new is 2017
1990272017",
Holy s*** my colon just went to a semicolon because I got scared That was amazing,
Theres nothing scarier than partial baldness ,
The new clown looks like the villain from the incredibles ,
"Mom Come up for dinner everybody
Me just a minute
Mom Its lasagna
Me 239",
it comes out to play every 27 years  its 2017 this year  the origional came out in 1990,
i didnt take a shower for 3 days after watching the old It,
In the novel IT awakens every 27 years The remake is 27 years later,
That was disturbing but I really want to see it I can relate so much,
That scary ad you cant skip,
"211

Man What
**screen** What",
This movie is what made me afraid of clowns,
It actually explains the clown attacks last year,
I hope ITs a good movie,
Holy mother of sweet God pearl WTF,
You think this is scary you should watch the It trailer but with The cat in the Hat,
holy mother of sweet god pearl i cannot wait to see this movie,
I think my problem with the new IT movie is that according to the book ITs Pennywise form wasnt supposed to be scary looking Pennywise was supposed to be the form that it used to lure kids sort of like the nice looking guy in the park looking for his lost dog that turns out to be a kidnapper The new Pennywise wouldnt do that he looks creepy when you first see him,
Omg  Im so scred my colon would turn into a semi colon BEST THING EVER,
this is the 90s kids revenge for todays kids ,
I have sleep paralysis Nothing but that scares me,
141 whenever I see a haunted house xD,
I kinda think the original clown is more scary just because it looks more insane and more unpredictable Like the new one is an obvious kind of scary and if you saw him you would know that he wants to hurt you but with the original you dont really know his motives,
417 Tim Curry is a national treasure yeah but not an american one Hes from England ,
holy mother of sweet god pearl,
The new clown looks like the villain from the incredibles movie to me,
seriously irritating that everyone keep calling IT a remake its a faithful adaption of Kings Novel,
The whole reason the original trailer wasnt scary is because back in the day they didnt give away so much crap that you know whats going on They left people wondering so theyd watch to find out whats happening Now we know darned near everything about a movie before its ever released so they have to hype up the scarycreepy because otherwise theres not much there but of course with this its a remake so it doesnt matter its all about effects,
The original clown is definitely scarier,
Everyone loves when they remake movies *cough* Ghostbusters *cough,
I wonder how many people know that Pennywise that creepy as clown is actually a spider,
Why do they even call him Pennywise the Dancing Clown Ive never seen him dance before not until I saw TerrorDance ft DJ Pennywise,
"If I had to pick the old Pennywise is scarier because he looks normal And thats what is supposed to creep you out about all of Kings work  the danger in the everyday


The film just isnt frightening though It was run of the mill 30 years ago and its run of the mill now",
The clown situation across the world was a way to advertise the new movie or remake of Stephen Kings IT,
you guys are not scared by the clown you are scared by the music that tells you to be scared,
Everyone loves when people remake old movies ahaha excuse me,
could you please do in adults react to Rick and Morty,
STRANGER THINGGGGS,
Is NOT a remake Is an adaptation of the book ,
258 I love my son but if he said Youll float too welp i dont have children anymore She kills me XD,
who here hates clowns but want to see it,
Tims clown is way creepier It has the classic clown look,
Am I the only one who doesnt find this that scary,
show them the mike myers cat in the hat edit its scarier,
238 When you stub your toe on the coffee table,
The last it movie came out in 1990 Pennywise comes out and terrorizes Derry every 27 years Whats 199027 2017,
this movie left me with a trauma when i was 7 20 years later and i still wont go anywhere near rain gutters,
original is creepier to me the new one doesnt even look like the original one from the first movie the real reason that I think hes creepy is that you cant tell if hes evil or not because if you look from a far he looks normal but when you get close you know your going to get F*CKED xD,
Have them react to the it trailer but its the cat in the hat,
lol I once knew a guy through a friend that was terrified of clowns After their drama club rehearsal ended they all went to Dennys and I tagged along From our town to Dennys its a half hour drive While getting there I found out he was afraid of clowns so I said we all float down here in a gravely voice as a joke Bad idea He was driving and pulled over insisting I gtfo It took ten minutes for my friend and others to calm him down,
Stephen Kings books are life,
It didnt make me scared of clowns as a kid it made me scared of drains and sewers,
the new one looks like its something that came out of hot topic and  what i like about the old it was that it was a monster dressed like a clown and in this new one its a clown dressed like a monster so its not as scary,
Remember back in 2016 when everyone was dressing up as clowns and scaring people,

Like si eres otro latino que ve FBE con subtitulos  v,
The new IT isnt as scary he looks menacing like hes a problem however the original IT looks scary in the sense of not wanting to ever have to deal with it As a millennial I appreciate the bringing back of the old movies but I grew up on the old one and it has a more impactful effect still,
Anyone else think that clown trend is gonna come back,

I think the original one is very creepy because he looks so nice and classic The new one is hitting you over the head with the scary I love Steven King books so Ill go see it still I loved the original miniseries so I want to go see the remake,
Sharon got jokes I like Sharon,
everyone hates when Hollywood reboots movies,
"everybody loves when they remake movies

LOL what",
I think the old pennywise is scarier for the simple reason its still a clown and you think its somethung nice but youre wrong idk have to see the movie mayb thats just a bad shot of the new one,
Wow Tom is now an adult damn he grew up fast,
The original gave you more time to be afraid to get to know your fears,
Holy mother of sweet god pearl *aplause*,
This just raised the level of my fear of clowns from 100 to infinity Now I cant go to sleep and right now its 600 pm on a Wednesday,
I remember seeing it as a kid and having to sleep with an axe and holy water while having to survive to some way to realistic fucked up nightmares,
Nobody can out act Tim Curry so they had to up the ante on cosmetics and CG to get the same reaction,
Imagine Pennywise bumped his head while jumpscaring from the Sewer LOL,
What screwed clowns up for me was Poltergeist I was a kid when that movie came out and we went to see it That clown messed my head up forever I never liked clowns but that sealed it Pennywise just added to my clown PTSD lol,
"Im excited and Im scared And Im horrified from clowns







I wonder what will happen while I watch the movie",

"What are you afraid of






My responsibilities",
And a little trivia IT appears every 27 years in the moviebook universe 19902017,
I think the clown in the 90s is scarier because he looks like a real person unlike the other one,
Im glad there is one of the stranger things kids in this movie,
You can tell those adults havent watch a horror movie in a very long time,
I think that the movie will either be amazing or a complete mess The original is iconic because of Tim Curry solely He was the main character and he was in fact much more of a monster due to him tricking the children by his initial actions This one seems like its just some regular mediocre monster film Tim Burtons performance as Pennywise actually held some true character and personality,
LMAO When the guy said What after the film scene the word What appeared on screen and I thought it was edited in for a sec,
My mom let me watch the original when I was 5 Afraid of all drains including toilets showers manholes etc for months,

"Sharon This is IT
And then she leaves",
I genuinely think from the photos that Tim Curry clown is scarier Not because Im one of those ooooh the original is always better hipster types but just because bottom looks like Chucky from the sequels while top is closer to human looking but his eyes are soulless and teeth are terrifying Sure bottom one looks more evil but top one just looks like the interdimensional demon he is more than evil Beyond evil Im sure overall the new movie will be scarier in terms of atmosphere but lordy the clownier Pennywise looks the scarier he really is,
You cant really compare the two trailers since the 90s version was made for network TV and the new one is an actual movie,

When I was 9 my friend asked me if I had ever heard of Queen  I said I didnt think so so I asked my dad and he got out some cds and now Queen is one of my all time favourite bands,
