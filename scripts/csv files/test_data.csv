If Apple adds led notification lightring or always on display IR blaster back button and can still keep the OS smooth and pretty much lag freebest phone in existence but if you know Apple thatll never happen,neutral
*gorgeous displays*ahahaahahaha  v,positive
People should just wait for the 10th Anniversary series of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus8s in 2017 Not worth buying the 7 They didnt even really do anything that different with this seriesPASS,neutral

I wish reviewers would be more specific about battery use 810 hours a day can either be incredible if you mean screen on time or dismal if you mean total use Which one is it,neutral
Im still happy with my original 6,positive
The iPhone 7 is definitely worth the upgrade The world isnt ready for it Get the hell out of here lol The Verge Also poo pooing the most important and least talked about component of why Apples hardware is always a step ahead  engineering The meshing of hardware and software Every year the iPhones camera consistently beats out other smartphones in blind tests Except for camera specific feature phones etc No one else can duplicate what Apple does Thats a tough pill for many to swallow And that doesnt mean that there arent GREAT competitors either,neutral
A B E F G H J L M O P Q R T U W X Y Z Notice anything D I C K S are out for Harambe,neutral
I love when people make the argument that the iPhone is way overpriced but then they go out and buy a Note 7 for 800,positive
The Taptic Engine for home button with 3 levels of adjustment is just for the vibration Instead Apple should have levels of sensitivity That would have been more useful,positive
Love your accent Nilay,positive
At least iPhone 7 doesnt explode,negative

Hey Verge Terrific review,neutral
This reviewer is a REAL ONE I cant express how refreshing it is to have a reviewer that isnt bias  brainwashed,positive
Youre pretty much saying that you think its too advanced for this gen but its not If Apple wanted to throw all they have and put all their efforts into a phone then yes it would but theyre not doing that Theyre releasing already improved upon technology little by little just so suckers that feel a need to upgrade to the new iPhone because they think theyre cool throw more money at them Its a greedy company that has a lot more to offer than its letting on and its disappointing that they dont go all out,neutral

Beautiful phone but l will just get the 6S not much difference,positive

Actually if you check inside the phone the space where the headphone jack is seems to be to be replaced by the new home button feature,neutral
I wanted to love the iPhone 7 when i first saw it unveil at the press conference I was really excited but I believe I will just skip a year and wait for the iPhone 7s and hope that a much bigger leap has been made,positive

I just cant get past that horrible red dot Who designed that And who signed it off Its hideous,negative

OK Managing to integrate LTE into basically the same form factor is an amazing feat of engineering but the red digital crown is extremely ugly Why would Apple do that,neutral
So will the LTE give me wrist cancer,neutral
Lauren where is your twin,neutral
I dont get why people say its a to thick smartwatch I mean its 114 mm which is in regular watches quit thin My seiko automatik watch is the 13mm and is compared to other watch normal thickness and it wears perfectly fine so they could do it even thicker and it would be nowbig deal but on videos every watch looks so thick,neutral

You nitpick the heck out of the Surface keyboards but this gets away with a little bit awkward on your lap plus you brush away the lacks compared to the Logitech boards with I like the iPad one Then you lowkey call everyone who would expect a proper filesystem a nerd I dont want to say you meant nerd in a negative fashion but rather few people label themselves as nerds Due to this you smartly advocate Apple not giving their customers appropriate control over what is theirs I dont scream *BIASED* under every The Verge video but this sly normalization strategy is just too much,neutral

My ipad pro previous version has completely replaced my laptop Its wonderful,positive
Okay so the Ipad is slowly evolving into a laptop So why not just buy a 12 Macbook which is already the end product of what the iPad is becoming Eventually the line between iPad and Macbook will blur so much that the two will just clash but the one with OSX ports  an actual keyboard will always be top dog It begs the question where is Apple going with this,neutral

208 The truetone display is not necessarily a good thing It basically matches the color temperature of the display with the color temperature of the surrounding ambient lighting which is good for reading only as this relaxes the eye while reading For anything else its better to disable the function as it will alter the colors of any other content like videos games photos and so on if left on,neutral

The main reason that makes me consider the Apple TV is the TV App I really fell in love with it on my iPad Prime Video is so unnecessary tedious i love Netflix but theres just so much that dos not show up on the front page in and out Just last Week i watched Split on Prime ONLY because i was looking at it in the iTunes Store and later the TV App suggested to watch it for free on Prime Thats some pro consumer stuff going on If the TV App mixes together iTunes Sky Q Prime Video and Netflix as great as it dos on the iPad this is a classic Apple selling point of stuff just working more streamlined And thats stuff the average consumer uses gets used to and will pay for while the web nerds debate gigaflops and Ram amount Youll hate this when you read it because you are a web nerd but its just the reality normal people dont care that much normal people just want s**t to work,neutral
Thank you man for this I kinda still want to buy it,neutral

as of now 4K viewers have liked this video,positive
It seems that these latest products from Apple arent even finished yet For the iPhone 8 Apple Watch Series 3 and now the Apple TV reviewers have contacted Apple about their problems with the devices and Apples response always seems to be yeah were working on it Were they seriously that rushed in development that they couldnt ship the product and software in its completed form Obviously there are going to be bugs and usability issues that come with a global release that Apple could never have foreseen however this latest cycle of new products seems to be vastly incomplete,neutral
Actually this was a really balanced review Thanks,neutral

Thanks for this honest review You are correct on all counts Apple needs to do a little catch up with competitors I would like for Apple to be more compatible with other brands In a perfect world iTunes and Spotify would be seamless  not a fan of apple music  and Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV would sync I like and watch a lot of international TV and most series are only available via ACORN aka Am Prime Vid,positive
YouTube cannot be broadcasted in 4k is that right,positive
Couldnt care less about Atmos but the SDR to HDR mapping sounds like the worst idea ever They cant possibly do this on purpose No 4K HDR YT is a bummer as well but it really doesnt matter because GoogleYT sucks in general Not even the flagship Android TV box Shield TV which I currently own can do HDR YouTube and their recent update to the app just took away quality options All around a sorry state,neutral
Guys Dolby Atmos is coming this fall so relax,neutral

New apple TV is amazing The fact all movies you buy in 1080p are 4k and all of them are the same price means Apple TV is officially the best device for 4k TVs,positive
Great review thanks for looking at the specs that matter I for one wont be buying until they at least sort the displaying of lower resolution content out Pretty sure I had a Roku a while back that did the same thing trying to display 1080p at 4K and making a hash of it Leave the scaling to the TV they are usually way better at it,neutral
This needs to be updatedthey now support most of these things,positive
Fire tv is just as good and cheaper,positive

Honestly why he is the guy reviewing Apple products  Its never enough for him he always have fake arguments against them At the beginning he talks about price then he compares the Apple TV with an Xbox Come on man Choose a side between price and quality and make an argument Same goes for the Atmos Crying because we do not have Atmos with 4K HDR I dont see any Atmos speakers on your ceiling and more importantly where are the movies in Atmos I mean REALLY in Atmos  And beginning saying the Apple TV 4K doesnt support 4K on YouTube and giving the reason at the very end of the video Go on once and for all at the beginning and dont imply that its Apple fault Google is the only one trying is stuff Netflix supports 4K HDR on Apple TV Vimeo supports 4K only Google is giving the middle finger to everybody and trying to creat their own standards,neutral

Most people do not understand how innovative the SPen is and Samsung flagship phones are Remember Apples best stylus is called the Apple Pencil and it actually needs to be charged up to work but the SPen is powered by a special field above the screen so that you can hover select etc People also dont know that with Samsung phones you can use Samsung Pay using MST or Magnetic Secure Transmission technology to pay on almost ANY credit card scanner without support for NFC payments There are many more innovations that you get with Samsung phones that you just dont get with other phones,positive

Houses will be made like Iphones He means overpriced underfunctioning and obsolete in a year then you will have to buy a new house 139k for a basically a hotel room These people really dont understand what affordable means,neutral
As a concept I like it But the execution is poor an example of a company so focused on cool that basic structural engineering problems are ignored For instance the flat roof flat roofs are great if they arent actually flat you need some gradient on the roof so that water doesnt stagnate Now look at 305 the roof has stagnating water on it because the roof wasnt designed with a gradient or at least not one sufficient for drainage The person living in the house will eventually end up with a leaking roof Architects and engineers are helpful for thinking of and solving these issues the Kasita team doesnt seem to have many of them Again I like the concept of small efficient living spaces but Im not putting my money into something like this until their team realizes the product has to be a good product not just a cool one,neutral
If this was affordable it would be innovative this is cool but how can poor people who have the real housing problem benefit from this,neutral

Great review No bullshit Just honest thoughts Im ditching the X for iphone 8 It makes no sense to me especially when they are almost the same bench spec wise And  I then dont have this awkard top notch just because Apple wanted to be different *eyeroll* The only thing I like about the X is the new home button concept it is pretty nice usability wise and offers many possibilities Face recognition had Samsung already 15 year earlier and augmented reality had Sony in 2016 with Xperia I think it is pretty cool but makes still no sense to me right now There is still no real use of augmented reality maybe in a few years when there is actually better hardware and also use cases Anyway its a cool feature to play with but I dont throw a grand just because of this even if I could,positive
When you get a Samsung S8 ad before watching this,neutral
Animojis look cool Not sure if 1K cool though,neutral
how to fix you face id problem put it at neck level or jaw level not at hip level omg,neutral
sony xz1 4k is the best phone display ever made even beating samsungs oled because even when it is set for 1080P in down scales so well text and everything is super sharp much better than the 1080P and 750P lcds on the iPhone or samsung oled But the thing is most youtube reviewers never have them side by side and it is a battery drainer of course at 4K and bezels  I like your honest review looks like so far the note 8 lg v30 Mate 10 and upcoming U11 plus are the great flagships this year Maybe next year Apple will have all of the bugs ironed out And settle with qualcomm so we can get the best bluetooth hires audio codecs for the next wireless airpods and beats as the current ones have none and some of the fastest cell phone downloads with qualcomm lte 5 gigabit,positive
GREAT REVIEW I love you showed us that not everything is perfect about the iPhone X not like other youtubers saying everything is just awesome about it just because they got the phone for free,positive

How is the iPhone Xs memory management Seems like with iOS11 or the A11 Bionic chip apps arent kept in the background as long as before referring to Phonebuffs speed test videos with the iPhone 8 phones whereas iPhone 7 phones managed to keep more apps in the background Could be a software issue can be managed with a software update just wondering how things fare with the iPhone X now Thanks you guys,neutral

Less usable space than the 8 plus Ill wait for the 11 plus when theres way more usable space and all the bugs are worked out The inconsistency in the face ID alone is a deal breaker for me What were they thinking Do they think we just use this as a toy,neutral
If you setup FaceID outside would it work better outside,neutral

Nice phone but honestly still very expensive Still on that first gen of that 6,neutral
Why is everyone defending Face ID fails when hes actually using the device and youre not  Citing the distance etc How about when youre driving and the phone is To your side or dash How about when you live somewhere sunny  or youre in a deli with weird lighting  Lets be transparent Touch ID was amazing  Having a headphone jack was amazing  Change for the sake of change is obnoxious and only hurts the end user  Happy I opted for the 8 plus ,neutral
Im pretty sure Apple products are made by vampires because all their screens are terrible comparatively under sunlight,neutral

IPhone X should have been the iPhone 8 and the price should have been the same as the iphone 8 There is absolutely nothing new in the iPhone X and the competitors have been making phones without bezels for over a year Before anyone buys this product they should try a Note 8 for 5 minutes and consider what exactly are they getting for the extra dollars in the iPhone X just saying,neutral
I think soon with the X they should just make the area surrounding the notch a permanent status bar so we can finally know the time without having to budge with our Youtube,neutral
The notch Killed this iphone Period,neutral
All the unboxing of the iphone x on youtube are the white version and the box in already openhmmm,neutral

I havent used an iPhone since the iPhone 4 It has always been Note series for me but I may get the iPhone 10 as a backup to my Note8,neutral
Paperclip First time you got an iphone,neutral
Just wait for the Iphone XI,neutral
Although this is a cool phone I seriously doubt it would be great to use daytoday no jack screen notch no fingerprint scanner,positive
Samsung phone are so great that its owners always get a itch in their hole which gets satisfied only by blasting apple rather than just being happy and using their phone You guys coming here and blasting apple proves how unsatisfied you all are with samsung products and roam here and there trying to prove a point,positive
Best review so far,positive

Did you honestly say the animoji are the best feature of this phone,positive
Bump that Iphone X A 1000 for a phone Man that phone betta pay my phone bill for all i care,neutral
I would like to know 1 What is the black bar made of Is it protected by the glass or is it metal As I am afraid minor hair scratch or dirtfinger smuges there will break face id 2 The gestures to close apps can you easily do them with one hand 3 When using the phone do you feel the camera bump as it seems massive 4 XD just out of curiosity does face id work when you hold the phone upside down,neutral
Could you possible hold the phone any farther away from your face when testing FaceID No wonder it doesnt work its barely out of your pocket,neutral
i dont understand why people waste money trying to upgrade anyway a phone is a phone and they all do the same thing pretty much im fine with my 6s plus and galaxy s7 edge,neutral
The FACE ID problems HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH Good job apple hahahhaah,positive
This review is nuts How would you expect Face ID to work if you are holding your phone like half the size of your height,neutral
Apple fan here Been looking for an honest review since the first impressions video dropped over the last 2 days Most of them seem exceptionally biased and dont talk about the obvious cons of the phone like that darn notch The major turn off is that thing and if most of my videos look weird or Ill have to shrink it into some weird smaller dimension I dont think its worth the 1000 price tag at all esp when I watch a lot ot YouTube and Netflix on my current iPhone Im basically compromising functionality for a design flaw And most developers will have a serious headache getting apps to look good with that notch Guess Ill skip this gen,neutral
Waste Apple was about simplicity now theyre more of ,neutral
the gestures They look to me to be really anoying to use Seems like the home button to do a lot of these actions just seemed easier and more intuitive How anoying is the missing home button I really feel llike they should just use an onscreen home button like android if they are going to go this route,neutral
Did he just say animoji is the best feature of the phone at 412,positive
I cannot believe how apple handled how videos are displayed Heres a shiny big new screen buuuut we are gonna shrink everything down to hide our awful design,negative
Wait theres an 8,neutral

Hmmm speakers on the bottom and in the earpiece sounds familiar Where have I seen this before Oh wait yes lol thats right The HTC 10 Haha I recall not long ago the nonsense of people claiming that HTC was copying Iphone when they released the HTC A9 because yes it did look like a Iphone But realistically the overall design originated from earlier HTC phones Seems to me it is Iphone who is getting their great innovative ideas from HTC The BIGGEST underrated phone of all times in my opinion is the HTC 10 The price was not an easy one to digest when you had such great competitor phones available at a cheaper margin but over all in my opinion the HTC 10 is the best ALL ROUND phone on the market to date,positive

I dont get why everyones always on the Apple hate train They removed the headphone jack and are giving you the adapter Big deal Apple did it with the floppy disk everyone bitched but they followed Apple did it again with the removal of DVD drives in laptops everyone bitched but now look at every laptop out there Weve used this analog jack FOR OVER 100 YEARS and Samsung would definitely never take that first step towards moving to digital audio Apple is a company that stands for diversity in engineering women LGBTQ asians etc for privacy even fought the govt and has BY FAR the best environmental standards in tech nearly 100 renewable energy and 99 of recycled non harmful material used for packaging Also they have the best productservice ecosystem instant updates best customer service and product reliability blazing performance and the list goes on All these android fanboys are so deluded thinking that this product just randomly became the best selling product in history as if it were an accident And as for the innovation although Apple may not have been the first to things they definitely got their implementation nailed Look how Google ditched Wallet and released Android Pay soon after Apple Pay released with the same implementation how all phones got fingerprint sensors after iPhone implemented it correctly how Android Auto came out after CarPlay etc etc etc Google and Apple are both incredibly successful and innovative but I just dont understand all this blind Apple hate when theyre actually doing some incredible work,neutral

it is surprising to me that not many people know that this is a new processor and probably consumes less power Samsung knows what they are doing they know that this phone is critical samsung didnt reduce the size of the battery capacity entirely because of the note 7 what happened with the note 7 was manufacturing problems with the battery etc samsung even changed the chemicals used in the battery so it has a longer lifespan optimization can give a battery with not that giant capacity the ability to last for the same amount of time and the same amount of time over usage samsung obviously thought of this they wont pull an Apple on us that would be suicide,neutral
dont forget to talk about how the phone is defaulted at 1080 out of the box when you do your review could you review it with giving battery performance at 1080 and 2k,neutral

Currently running my iPhone 6 Been staying relatively up to date with what Apples been doing Nothing Ive seen so far has rocked my world enough to upgrade and Im genuinely impressed with how my iPhone has held up over the years But Im getting fed up with the little things Examples Instagram suiciding itself whenever I try to use the new features I dont even use Snapchat anymore because of how slowly it runs limited storage capacity and I refuse to pay for more cloud storage After watching no less than 30 videos comparing the best smartphones I think Im going to pull the trigger on the Moto G6 At only 250 it will at least serve as a wellperforming bridge until one of these phones really sets themselves apart to me Mr Brownlee keep slaying the reviews my friend,neutral

Damnit I was considering upgrading to pixel 2 xl because Im still on the OG and I firmly believe its not entirely necessary to have the newest version if the previous is still good and will cost less However I use my phone A LOT for IG and colours are so important Going into lightroom and dealing with that mess of not knowing what my edits are going to look like on other peoples screens is going to drive me insane This was so helpful in illustrating that,neutral

I have to say that some of the comments are terrible Marques hasnt been shy about his preference for Android devices though he typically carries both an iPhone and whatever is his favorite Android device at the moment He has also expressed how important cameras are to him in his smartphones So how does this mean the guy being paid by Google for a favorable review FYI YouTube is owned by Google People talking about how black he is and his haircut Dont yall trolls have anything better to do than to be negative towards the young fella Guess you wish you were making his high 6 to 7 figures Terrible haters Keep up the good work Marques,neutral

I just ordered a black and white 2XL Ive used iPhones exclusively since the 3GS and always found it very limited in many ways Dont get me wrong Im definitely a fan of iOS and iPhones in general but Im excited to step out of that ecosystem and see what pure android has to offer A bit of offaxis blue shifting is definitely not a big enough issue to avoid the Pixel in my opinion There are so many more Ws in its column than there are Ls and if Im going to sink my teeth into android I want to experience it in its best form and be the first to receive updates when it inevitably gets better I considered getting an S8S8 for a bit but after seeing how well tuned Googles software experience is along with a few other things I liked much more about the Pixel 2XL it really wasnt a competition in my mind,neutral

I think its ugly or at least jarring Doesnt photograph well and I am very skeptical of 3D facial recognition How well does it work in low light What about when I am driving and want to do simple tasks like advance the track  Lots of questions that need answered Intial reaction is to stick with the safer 7s design which I am sure will have the same fast internals Or at least wait for 8s,neutral

This is a dummy model and people saying it looks cheap The world has no hope,positive
Who is here after the giveaway announcement,neutral
Im surprised many people in the comments dont like this design because this model is actually my favorite one to date To be fair the white color doesnt do it justice I think judging by the glossy material that this phone will look much better in black The glass back and the chrome edges look more classier The larger screen to phone size ratio is much more practical than buying a larger phone for a larger screen with bulkier edges The only thing I didnt like with this model is how the white edging on the front facing cameras is awkwardly placed They should have just extended the edges instead of keeping the corners bare Its not like the corners are going to be actively used or even touched so the design doesnt feel effective It will also distract users when playing games or watching movies I dont even know how notifications will be placed when the edge stands in the way I feel like the majority will purchase this model in black so the awkward top edges are less visible with the black screen when turned off,neutral
People Saying this Ugly But they all buy it the 1000 Animoji Machine iphn X,negative

am i the only one who likes bezels,neutral
I made the decision to upgrade to this phone from my Galaxy Note 3 and so far its been the best decision I couldve made 1080p is more than enough for me since my eyes arent electron microscopes and I hold my phone at a reasonable distance from my face,positive
As someone who is among the 65 of people who doesnt have 2020 vision why would I spend as much as 500 for little more than slightly higher resolution and poorer performance I think 1080p is truly taking the consumer into account rather than charging us more for something we dont benefit from so they can earn bragging rights,positive

There are quite a few people here saying that Bluetooth headphones will solve the issue They are probably the same types of people to rip their music from YouTube converter at the lowest possible bitrate and not give a single fuck about audio quality Bluetooth will never sound as good as a wired connection with a dedicated amp And as someone who buys music in FLAC rather than mp3 I refuse to use bluetooth,neutral

Android phones will get rid of the headphone jack too if Apple does it And where will all the rage be what will all the haters do where are we going to find room to put away all the contradictory comments Theyll say well at least they did it with USBC But thats the same thing the headphone jack is still gone you need new earphones or an adapter and none of your docks will work with USBC Its the saaaaame thing Theres no way competitors are going to NOT copyfollow other successful competitors They all do it to one another Even Apple If I had to bet on it changes are coming and itll take 24 years to get used to this one Its a big one,neutral

If Apple actually removes the 35mm headphone jack in lieu of the Lightning port then count me out The 30 pin connector was understandable but the 35mm jack is ubiquitous and is far from being obsolete Im not entirely against phasing out the 35 mm jack but it shouldnt be just to make the iPhone thinner especially without focusing on improving battery life which is a bigger issue considering battery tech has stagnated and it shouldnt be with Lightning USB Type C is going to be the universal standard and it would make far more sense Apple has even used USB Type C in the new MacBook and is a fan of the IO Lightning is a limited proprietary connector with known durability issues that hasnt even taken hold among thirdparty battery cases designed for the iPhone its still all Micro USB excluding Apples own battery case,neutral
I dont get what the point of removing the headphone jack is Even if the argument is that theres higher sound fidelity youre still converting to analogue audio *facepalm*,positive

You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about Apple killing off all those old technologies but Look around do you actually want a CD drive Design is about prioritizing some featurestechnologies over others Its not that were all suckers nice jab at the OG Apple logo btw its that the compromise yes thats what it is is worth it Apple also makes a MacBook that only has one USB port Theyre doing the right thing even if the transition to the future might sting a little,neutral
this is ridiculous this is apple being tryhard innovative without steve jobs people will not simply get used to it like everything else the headphone jack is the standard from everything casual music to audiophile listening to professional studio music production nobody is gonna want a high priced headset or monitors just to use with stupid iphone,neutral

The difference between this change and the previous ones like getting rid of the floppy disk drive is that the new ports they replaced them with were industry standards like USB whereas the lighting connecter is a proprietary Apple connector So are Apple going to let everyone use Lighting or are we going to forever have two types of audio connecters  Apples one and everyone elses,neutral

Lol I dunno how apple fanboys deal with constantly different proprietary chargers One big reason why the internet is so massive and servers are so easy to operate is because of manufacturers standards Every ethernet cable is the same every usb is the same every parallel connector is the same and each one of those has a specific function If every company were like Apple every country youd go would have different types of connectors hundreds of them performing the same task on different devices If a certain manufacturer tanked in a recession every local business would have to swap out their equipment and cabling Proprietary hardware kills progress for short term marginal profit Standardized equipment converges technology and benefits every single company even companies in different sectors Thats just one of the reasons why I think Apple is shit,neutral

Yeah Apple have removed stuff before but this is the AUDIO JACK Its not the same as other standards Sure Apply removed the floppy drive but that was because CDs were simply better and they removed the CD drive but that was because digital downloads are simply better 30pin connecter was too simply inferior to the Lightning cable Theres no better solution for audio What bluetooth There arent enough of them around and theyre ridiculously expensive And using the lightning port brings up the new MacBooks 1 USBC problem its not practical Apple has only ever removed things when there was an alternative that was superior in pretty much every way in order to speed up the adoption of the better format There isnt a better format for audio jacks,neutral

Im sorry but all the possible benefits you mentioned from using headphones through the lightning port are all possible with the 35mm jack My phone has digital noise cancellation build in and the phone recognizes when you plug in a certain type of headphonesearplugs and you can setup what you want to happen when you do plug them in open a music app change the volume turn the noise cancelling on or off etc The number 1 reason why Apple would want to get rid off the 35mm jack and use the lightning port is very simple money and market share 3 times guess who makes headphones with lightning cables Yes Beats which is owned by Apple They are not the only ones to make them and there are much better brands out there but they make them They just want to promote and sell more Beats headphones slap another 50 bucks onto the price and say that they are designed for iPhones Nothing points to the fact that Apple would do it to save space If space for lets say a bigger battery would be such an issue why are they making their phones thinner all the time The idea you mentioned at the end of what your perfect new iPhone would be is what I think the majority of phonetech enthousiast want Sadly 90 of people buying iPhones are far from tech savvy and mostly only buy it because of the name,neutral

Id rather have a galaxy s7 than an iPhone honestly,positive
Holy shit I havent been paying attention to technology in general much since the S5,neutral
I have always loved to buy the Samsung Galaxy S phones and one of the main attractions was not just the removable battery but also the option of additional storage via SD card slot I dont know why the reviewers always seem to make a fuss about the plastic feel of the phone it never bothered me in fact I prefer it because it made the phone stand out in a positive way in my mind because you could remove and load up a fresh battery to get you through the day Why some people think that the Galaxy phone is trying to look like the iPhone is a bit of mystery to me but if that is what Samsung was aiming for I would certainly be disappointed because as far as Im concerned the iPhone has more hype and the Samsung more value for money but both devices are equal in terms of performance and usability its just a matter of choice So in short I would have already purchased an S6 or S6 Edge buy now but Im holding off because of my concerns about battery life and the lack of external storage Im seriously thinking of going for one of the Chinese phones eg Meizu that may not have the desired options of battery and storage but are a lot cheaper with excellent performance,neutral

I am writing this from a iPhone 10 after a week of use as my daily driver So Im coming off the google pixel for the last year And before that I was iPhone 3g4 5 5s and 6 I hate how you big reviewers dont flat out call out apple and other companies when they are on bull shit The pixel had the pip for YouTube where I can keep the video going while doing other things on the phone They didnt put the usb c on this phone for but its on the iPad and MacBooks Wtf u have to pay 90 to get apple rapid charging cables and box Who gives a fuck about the notches Its 1000 and doesnt come with AirPods but the galaxy 10 is coming with free buds on pre order They still havent dropped the apple air power wireless charging and google pixel 3 has the charging stand for 70 and I bet air power will be upwards of 150 Yall always talk about screen time right out the box brand new But we all know screen time matters after a year of use and going through the software upgrades and then noticing your battery life is shit all of a sudden after that new software upgrade So fuck screen time right out the box we all know its gonna be good And yall never call out this company for implementing things in their phones that have already been done by Samsung and others And then apple passes these old features off as new and innovative Most of you big reviewers are getting free stuff from the companies so yall wont keep it real and 100 And the god damn air pods dont have wireless charging that Im sure they could have easily added but wanted to keep people in the market for the AirPods 2 and charge 200 No volume control on the air pods either All this is shit that should be on this phone for 1000 Yall never speak on this shit But like I said yall dont want to stop getting invited to the press releases and getting the free stuff and the fame that comes with being a big tech reviewer Cause if Yall didnt care you guys would call out bullshit The phone isnt that bad but for 1000 it could have been a lot better,neutral

This is the first Google phone yes made by HTC but they would not credit them similarly to the first iPhone released by Apple So for a first phone its quite good but obviously there will be flaws you may hate the design bezels etc Im sure the next version of Pixel would be improved with feedbackcriticisms Every company has to start off somewhere but rarely start at the top,neutral

Holy shit Ok Im VERY excited for this,positive
This phone puts Apple to shame when it comes to being overpriced,neutral
I would like to see RED focus pun intended on making a camera in the lower price range instead of focusing on making it compact My thoughts are that making electronics and optics small and compact is expensive and I would rather pay a few hundred dollars less for something less compact or the same price as the phone on a camera that gives higher quality video,neutral
Nice device Never heard of RED Gonna have to look into them,positive
You know what they say about having big hands Big handsbig phone,neutral

You should collaborate with Tailosive Tech,neutral
Well so much for 3045 days,neutral
i wish they could make a more smooth design,positive

This is what a Borg carries aroundwth,neutral
The 2 cameras with flash looks like an emoji face,neutral
they should make the side flat looks better,neutral
I like how you say that the material prototype is EXACTLY what theyre aiming for And its EXACTLY what they intend it to look like Thats a weird way of using the word exactly Maybe something to consider for future videos its extremely seldom I find anything for you to improve on ever,neutral
Waiting for the update on thisand wishing it was OLED too,neutral
Hey Marques Great video Can we get a studio tour Thanks from Toronto Canada,positive
Another phone will be in the lost memory lane within a few months,neutral
What if with the 2 Lenses they enabled stereoscopic 3d with the holographic display and possibly 3d video recording,neutral
10 months without news on this phone I guess RED abandoned the project ,neutral

OMG Amazing thanks for the sneak preview,positive
Over a year later This phone flopped Unless the modules are so overwhelmingly good that they justify the hype,positive
I hope that theyll bring a Mod to use the Smartphone in combination with a RED Cinema Camera Maybe as a screen so you dont have to buy the expensive Screen from RED You just buy the Smartphone and you have a Screen for your RED Camera or Remote Control for RED Cameras If theres a dangerous situation on set you just pick your Hydrogen and you control framing shutter aperture iso  framerate directly from the Phone,neutral
Great job on your reviews Marques Been watching you for a while now and I enjoy your honest opinions and delivery Well done as usual,positive
This phone reminded me of asus zenfone ARdont know why,neutral
Im just going to keep watching this video until there is new info on this thing,neutral

Low key kind of no reason for me not to buy this Ill wait a bit after it releases to see all the issues that arise bit essentially having a super portable mirrorless camera at all times on me Awesome Sign me up,neutral

The Camera and the display better be excellent cause my DSLR is heavy af,positive
its been 40 years now i have a beautiful grandchild now,positive
Anybody gonna buy this instead of the Iphone X,neutral
The phone design is really ulgy NOW LET ME DEFINE WHAT I MEAN By design i mean how it looks not the material used At a quick look it looks good But that can be easily accomplished with a refined and much better look and design They need without a doubt once they are read to release the phone change it but they can still keep the theme of where they were going Also nowdays prototypes that are displayed for the public is 910 times the end design for the look on the phone,neutral
With this kind of build quality you really dont need any case,positive
Love that slick Billy Joel sample in the intro song,neutral
Looks like it was made on a year 2005 what a design,neutral
Thank you Red guys FINALLY,neutral
You look like Wes from How to get away with Murder,neutral
Red is the kind of company to put out a pair of headphones that will only work with this phone and charge 400 for them lol,positive

Good job dude but the display wasnt even lit there wasnt any reflection from it on your eyes so yeah they aint got anything working yet,positive

Nice review Marques Thanks for taking the time to share with us Looks pretty promising,positive

Now thats a camera bump I can deal with,neutral
2018,neutral
Is it worth preordering Not till I get more specifics on the tech used on the phone If you can attach lenses through a mount that would be great,positive
In my opinion this phone is like the Nintendo 3ds most ppl will use the holographic screen to show off but will use the normal screen similar to the Nintendo 3ds,neutral

You got to work on more emotional reaction You are too calm and in control lol,positive
You got taste in music that sped up billy Joel gave me the fix I needed,neutral
This phone had better be worth the 1200 pricetag,positive
My man showing us Teslas and Red products like convinced that 90  of his audience can afford and will buy these products,neutral
If this phone has some crazy 3d display and has a camera better than most mirrorless cameras then 1200 is a pretty fair price if not a low price,neutral
i think this is the new best camera phone of the 2018,positive
we need a compilation of mkbhd saying I have big hands,neutral
i thought it was a smart doorbell at first lol,positive
Lol people bitching about the phone look ugly expensive and useless to me the phone design is look nice cool and this is just a prototype,neutral

90 opinions  10 information,neutral
Wow I would sell my soul for this How about a GIVEAWAY,neutral
Why is everyone trying so hard to hate this phone Its not even out yet these are just prototypes Also most likely if you hate the concept its target demographic isnt you Buy a Pixel 2 when it comes out and shut up,negative
The moto xperia xz premium,neutral

That Is a really nice phone I want one but the price holy hell,positive
so is it basicly the htc evo 3D ,neutral
Wau  really great seeing a company pushing the envelope like that and that the modular concept isnt dead yet I personally would keep the headphone jack at the bottom but overall it looks promising,neutral
But will it use Android 7 or 8,neutral
Im going to McDonalds you guys want anything,neutral
You missed the most important part The camera looks like a face ,positive
It will be interesting to see if it shoots different frame rates and shutter speeds for the video Im also interested to know if you can choose different codecs to shoot like raw red I just hope you dont need a red rocket card to play back the footage at full quality because that would kill the phone immediately Also Im just imagining the amount of bloatware that will be on it,neutral
This phone is a joke It didnt come with a real screen but I got a proto type second phone with the screen but I cant show you that either but it came with preloaded content just for it Im sick of red and the BS hype around this,neutral
Why do phone makers still put the volume rocker on the left And not with the power but this is a huge deal breaker for me and extremely impractical,neutral
Theirs probably packages to include the charger,neutral
Hands on but is blurred out so what was the point Lmfao world exclusive yeah sure clickbait,positive
I think its a bold move by Red but would have loved if the design was a bit better,positive

To those who are thinking of getting an Iphone SE let me tell you you will not be disappointed I just bought one and its awesome It works really well software is amazing the built quality feels very premium The battery life is very very good If your not a major gamer and you use the phone for business purposes your phone can last you over a day I used to own a midrange phone the ASUS Zenfone 6 with a 3300 mah battery and I can tell you for a fact that the Iphone SE battery lasts much longer Its really all depends on how efficient the entire system is and because the Iphone is very efficient Apple doesnt need to stuff a large battery for the phone to last a day I have seen some reviews wherein the Iphone SE battery lasts longer than the S7 The camera quality is great both for front and back Dont get confused by the over super detailed comparison between the photo quality of the Iphone SE to other other phones In real life usage you wont even see any difference The only thing I can see why this phone will discourage some people is because of the screen size Thats all everything else works so well Games work smoothly even the high graphic games work smoothly Despite the screen being small it really doesnt affect game play Even typing is not difficulty My old phone was 6 inches and I shifted to 4 inches and I dont regret one bit The price of this phone is similar to the Samsung Aseries and believe me the Iphone SE feels more premium and works more fluid I used to only have Android Phones and the Iphone SE is my first Iphone and I know realize how big the difference is between Iphone and the rest of the pack ,neutral

hi marques could you review a8 2018,neutral
The fingerprint sensor is literally the perfect position for me I have small hands but Ive always held the phone around the middle not the bottom like it seems you do so my finger doesnt have to stretch to reach the sensor Feels like a very natural position and placement to me Holding the phone any lower down makes it feel top heavy anyway So yeah fingerprint sensor is in the perfect place in my opinion,positive
I cant believe how far Samsung has come in 2 years from near bezelless to completely bezel less  well minus the camera cutout D ,neutral
The future is now my laptop automatically played this video at 4K 3,neutral

Please tell which is powerfull sd 835 or exyno 8895,neutral
Your videos always look crispy as fuck I just love watching it And great review as always ,positive
I find your impression about the fingerprint reader positioning very strange I just received my Galaxy S8 yesterday When I hold it in my notsobig hand in a normal way the fingerprint reader is right under the tip of my index finger Actually it would be so awkward if it was in the center and lower Some people say you may put your finger over the camera and make it dirty thats invalid too 1 Dont forget about muscle memory it will become second nature in a week 2 Cellphone lenses are already dirty in comparison to what we expect from a camera because they dont have protection and are exposed to direct touch so they should be cleaned before shooting serious photos regardless of what the phone is 3 I think cellphone cases which many people use will help us distinguishing fingerprint reader a little bit better andor protecting the lens from being touch I think the only valid complain would be from lefthanded users And finally dont forget it has iris scanner,neutral
Thanks I got the s8 but your wallpaper looks dope Can you share its link,neutral
Metal and Glass I am holding of right now It really doesnt feel that way And how can i get that skin,neutral

I liked this up until you said Jif instead of Gif Down voted and unsubbed,neutral
To be honest I think Im going to wait on the S9 because Im satisfied with my s7 edge I always wait for a double update but to be more honest the reason I do it is because I cant afford to update every year,positive

Galaxy S7 ELECTROCUTED ME I bought my device in April 2016 and it had already gone for repair twice to the service centre This is the 3rd time I have faced an issue with the charging port on the phone as it ELECTROCUTED me I am not even exaggerating it literally shocked me while it was in my right front pocket The intensity was so high that I jumped and screamed in pain After multiple requests Samsung has shamelessly denied to replace my device I had just returned from work on my motorcycle 5 mins before the incident I COULD HAVE DIED if this would have happened while I was riding on the highway and no one would have known why I crashed I had a lot of trust in Samsung but how their service team has behaved with me is beyond shameful The service manager on the phone even told me that compensation would have been provided if something bad had happened I was baffled by such a remark because it shows how much they care about their consumers Samsung Note 7 the grenade wasnt enough that they created Galaxy S7 the tazer Dont be a fool like me DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG devices if you want to be safe Regards Kushal Kaushik This is a genuine case write to me is you have any suggentions on how I should deal with Samsung  SocialJunkiee,neutral

Bixby is the future The secret to Bixby is the system actually writes its own code In contrast to any other similar system It is a profound and monumental giant leap forward Dynamically Evolving Cognitive Architecture The structure of the Voice First world is held together by Intelligent Agents Intelligent Agents use AI Artificial Intelligence and ML Machine Learning to decode volition and intent from an analyzed phrase or sentence The AI in most current generation systems like Siri Echo and Cortana focuses on speaker independent word recognition and to some extent the intent of predefined words or phrases that have a hard coded connection to a domain expertise Bixby uses a patented 1 exponential self learning system as opposed to the linear programed systems currently used by systems like Siri Echo and Cortana What this means is that the technology in use by Bixby is orders of magnitude more powerful because Bixbys operational software requires just a few lines of seed code to establish the domain 2 ontology 3 and taxonomy 4 to operate on a word or phrase In the old paradigm each task or skill in Siri Echo and Cortana needed to be hard coded by the developer and siloed in to itself with little connection to the entire custom lexicon of domains custom programmed This means that these systems are limited to how fast and how large they can scale Ultimately each silo can contact though related ontologies and taxonomies but it is highly inefficient At some point the lexicon of words and phrases will become a very large task to maintain and update Bixby solves this rather large problem with simplicity for both the system and the developer Specimen of the developer console identifying domain intent programing Bixbys team calls this new paradigm the Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system There is limited public information on the system and I can not address any private information I may have access to However the patent Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system based on thirdparty developers 5 published on December 24th 2014 offers an incredible insight on the future Bixby Has Built An Easy Way For Developers To Build This Bixby patent is a landmark advance for Intelligent Agents and the resulting Voice First devices and uses case that will be developed on the platform The process for adding new domain experience is a simple process in the developer app To define a new intent the domain is established by programing a horizontal flow chart that helps to define ontology and taxonomy with in the entire system The results are lines of code that will forever be dynamically changing and connecting as more domains of intent are established Bixby literally programs itself This is process is related to self modifying code that has been around since the 1960s from assembly language to Cobol However the process that Bixby uses is radically more advanced The limitations we have all come to know with Siri Echo and Cortana and the Chat Bots released with Facebook M are tied to the limitations of extending new intent domains and connecting new ontologies and taxonomies Not only does each intent domain need to be programed from decoding a word or phrase but these silos of intents need to some how connect when more complex sentences are created For example SiriAlexa I want to pick up a Pizza on the way to my girl friends house and I would like to find a perfect wine to pick up along the way Also would like to bring her flowers Currently Siri and Alexa could not understand the intent of this paragraph nor could it easy connect to the six domains and many ontologies to produce a useful result Bixby could learn this in a few minutes and constantly connect with new intent domains by expanding the ontological references each domain represents Another feature of Bixby will be the user profile that defines Conversational intentUnderstands What You Say Location context Time context Task context Dialog context Understands You Learns and acts on personal information Who are your friends Where do you live What is your age What do you like You will set privacy fences around any information that Bixby learns and you will be able to choose to allow the system to share this data with any intent domain Of course security and privacy will always be an issue with Intelligent Agents and Bixby is working on a new model that will quickly define what is logically private and potentially shareable with permissions,neutral

Hit Like For The Best Techie Marques,positive
I really dont understand why the front is not black,neutral
MKBHD i would just like to say that I will stop watching and everything else to reviewers that gets EARLY ACCESS to manufacturers device Because this EARLY ACCESS is in a way a form of payment to you Which leads to bias It leads to video formats that is less critical to the product For example instead of making a bend drop test or comparison review of the early access device you tend to go with a safer format video where you talk about iphone features you didnt know about  At the end of the day no manufacturer will let you have early access and them not benefitting from it I can see that you still have little criticisms however I can tell that its more for making the overall early access video legitimacy because it will sound like you are kissing their backside The gist of it is early access comes at a price and thats making a video thats balancing the benefits of maintaining that relationship with the manufacturers while at the same time critiquing but in a way thats not making it sound like this device is so lame Or sticking to a video format thats overall safe like the example I gave earlier So i will avoid viewing videos from youtubers that get early access Il only watch video reviews from reviewers that are not clouded by viewerships And focus on the critiquing side coz those benefits the consumers You should make a video of the in and outs  all details of how early access works for you And how you play with the balance of reviewing and not hurting the manufacturers that gives you early access Viewers need to know,neutral

Nothing beats a big fat AMG v8 D,neutral
Next thing you know people will be paying to have ads displayed on the screen,neutral
Why would you want to see your leftright indicator control lights anyway I think we can do without Its good that tesla throws conventions out the window But indeed it is important to optimize the design to the user So perhaps it would be better if some vital data is projected in front of the driver eg on the windscreen or the dash like speed And fine tune some of the controls wrt ease of use vs simplicity I mean moving everything to software is an interesting development opening up new possibilities and is probably cheaper in production  but it should not get in the way of the ease of use What if there is sn emergency and you need to get something from your glove compartment in a splitvsecond under a lot of stress You dont want to be forced to navigate through some computer screens then So as always a design must be clever  thinking of all use cases,neutral
You can even play your Nintendo Switch on the way to work,neutral

Dont forget you get a 10k rebate So if you get the 44k its really 34k and then u can slap on 10k worth of options and get everything you want for 44k so pretty much for about 45k you are gonna get the top of the line model 3 Mind you aint no gas baby Free charge Omg people pay 30000 a month on gas alone for a sedan type car Your putting 30000 a month back in your pocket Saving 3k a month add that times 5 years On a 5yr finance youll save 15k in 5yrs,positive

This car makes no sense For 45k get a 2017 mercedes cclass 300 or eclass,neutral
Great preview Subscribed Good to hear impressions from EV fan and Tesla owner ,positive
you forgot to say that the main reason concept is that is made with the idea of car sharing Tesla Network and also fully autonomos as you mentioned so any buttons like clovebox could be things that people that share your car could brake or wear from extensive use And having a button for a glovebox means people could access it you might not want that And the car also have a cabin facing camera to eventually monitor the people inside when shared when you look at it that way the design makes more sense,neutral
I can get my M3 as early as January if i get the upgraded battery but ill wait to Q2 2018 and get the base model its still a beautiful car,neutral
Basically I would just want the glass hood and full self driving capabilities so the price would be 50k almost seems like I should just buy a model s instead,positive

I think I might get a Model 3 after I pay off my current car I want to see them iron out the problems with the early models first plus Id like to save more for a decent down payment But I really like the idea of electric vehicles and the way I commute to work using almost an extra 4050 a week on Gas Id be saving money in the long run,neutral

I Love it The way you explained the simplicity of not having to many options and variance is what will make the car more affordable and more profitable for the company for example when I go to In out burger their menu is the most straightforward menu of any fast food restaurant If I go to Burger King I am overwhelmed with the different combos and variations of a flame grilled burger,positive

The question is can it drift,neutral
I wonder how adding electric motors and touchscreen controls for the aircon vents could possibly be cheaper than just having manual knobsswitches I want to get this car but living in Australia its likely going to be a while and well no doubt have our Australian surcharge stacked onto the purchase price fault of our Government not Tesla,neutral
I still cant call the model 3 affordable Sure its less expensive than the S but considering that autopilot costs 5k self driving costs 3k a color other than black costs 1k actually good looking wheels 15k and good interior 5k the car can get very expensive 35k is already above the average a person spends on a car and if you get a Tesla theres no way youd get it without autopilot,neutral
Yes I plan to get a T 3,neutral
Since Im trying to scale down my car purchases money wise Id start with the base model It sounds like a car I can afford and handle Glad its simple Thanks for the update I would love to test drive it,neutral
I love the vision that Elon Musk to better everyone quality of life Thanks Mr Musk,positive

I was considering this but as soon as I saw the headphone jack *Instabuy*,neutral
Its a amazing phone And its my favorite phone because it was cheaper than Samsung Note 8 and IPhone X I would say 5t is best,positive
And the most Ironic part is that Apple X costs just the same ie the price Apple is paying for each phone is around 300400  even less maybe I am using OnePlus 3T and it has never let me down Although I wont be upgrading anytime soon to OnePlus 5 because i am not financially ineptNeedless to say I will be buying a Oneplus 78 Cheerio Apple  you useless overpriced piece of shit who hasnt innovated since Job Died,neutral
it does a weird rainbow effect seriously do you look at your phone like that No I seriously think people are so foolish with money and wasting it on needless junk,negative
The head phone jack is definitely a win,positive
not bad considering its cheaper than iPhone back glass panel,neutral
It looks like a great phone not only because of its specs but also because of its price point I believe more Android user should consider buying it In that way we can discourage big companies to go beyond some crazy prices for their flag ships and support companies who are ready to provide good mobile gadgets for a reasonable price I hope 1 will consider investing in a phone in Samsung Note territory Then it will become a must buy to me,neutral

To those of you that claim this isnt smosh allow me to explain 1 smosh is a group founded by Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla as time went on they branched off into smosh games smosh cartoons and have also begun working with different people such as Mari Olivia Joven sohinki and wes these are all now members of smosh and thus all content made by them is smosh content 2 for those of you who say in the beginning it was only Ian and Anthony you are far from correct as in countless videos from the Pokemon videos the assassins creed rap to even the first food battle they had extras camera crew and side characters such as Ians mom Stevie and so on and the every blank ever videos are most likely heavily produced and directed by the founders just because the founders arent in EVERY video they make doesnt mean it isnt their content when was the last time you even heard the name Fusajiro Yamauchi for those who dont know Fusajiro Yamauchi is the founder of Nintendo and yet modern games such as smash bros 4 Pokemon x and y and hyrule warriors dont seem to have his face plastered everywhere i guess it isnt his content then i think you see my point,neutral

smile during interview not interested in knowing what happened when he was little on phone call fingerprints on pinapple bowl knew how she died before autopsy results were in This guy mad sus,neutral
DO A LIE DETECTOR TEST OMG,neutral
He looks like a crazy boy with that smilelike a psychopath,negative
exactly my question why is he smiling,neutral
can we at least agree that child beauty pageants are creepy as hell to start with,negative
Watch the interview when Burke was a child he is asked how he thinks she died He says maybe with a hammer and he swings his arm like hes hitting someone on the head Interesting Because this was before the autopsy results that confirmed she did indeed suffer blunt force trauma to the skull from an object Also I think Dr Phil should have confronted him on Patsys 911 call it was clear 2 other people were speaking in the background one a child and another adult male The whole I dunno nothin approach is pretty unbelievable His fingerprints were on the bowl of pineapple She ate the pineapple right before her death Screaming was heard from the house around 1am All the background voices on the 911 call Someone in that house knew something,neutral
If Burke did it I just hope one day he confessed what he did Poor girl she deserves peace and rest Its been a long time,neutral
Burke just CAN NOT look Dr Phil in the eyes as he said he did not kill his sister I saw all the police interviews when he was a child and he 100 killed her and his parents cover it up,neutral
Hes smiling as if hes replaying sexually abusing his sister and killing her with the hammer he mentioned as a child,positive
Why is this guy smiling the whole time That kinda freaks me out,neutral
I would wager my life Burke did it The parents were able to go on tv and honestly deny killing her because they didnt Also if one of the parents killed her they would not be covering for and supporting eachother The 911 call is the nail in the coffin You can hear Patsy asking someone what theyve done and the son responding something about getting arrested People need to understand the parents did whatever they could to not lose their only remaining child Most people would of done something similar If you compare Patsys hand writing sample to the ransom note you see its a 999 percent chance she wrote it If thats true she was covering for someone and that someone wouldnt be her husband She wouldnt protect that man after he murders her daughter The son however is a different story,neutral
I really truly believe that they all the three of them know exactly what happened to jonbenet,neutral
he murdered her  burke said he thought someone bashed her over the head BEFORE autopsy results came in he literally mimicked the way he murdered her  burke taking 5 minutes to identify pineapple in crime scene during interview acting very nervous and suspicious  his and his moms fingerprints on pineapple bowl  mom lied she didnt feed them pineapple  pineapple in bowl found at crime scene  pineapple found inside jon benet plus theres more evidence other than the pineapple but that was the big one for me,neutral
No justice for JonBenet Ramsey thanks to the incompetent police and parents,neutral
This whole family is dark,neutral
Burke has anger issues He used to hit her sister a lot watch Jim clementes documentary,negative
I think the brother he probably never got any attention,neutral
I mean come on even doctor Phil was a little weirded out look at his reaction in the beginning,negative
Detectives found a partial draft of the ransom note in the home and the legal pad on which the final ransom had been written on three of seven pages torn from the center of the padAnd although it may seem too obvious even to point out realize that unlike in the JonBenet Ramsey murder  a kidnapper doesnt write the ransom note in the house  a kidnapper doesnt write that herespectshis victims business  a kidnapper doesnt molest the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt kill the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt hang out writingand rewriting after the victim is dead  a kidnapper doesnt leave the victim behind in the house  a kidnapper doesnt forget to call to arrange to get the ransom money  a kidnapper doesnt break in on Christmas risking family stay overs  a kidnapper doesnt put oversized underwear found in the house on the victim  a kidnapper doesnt bring someone to the crime 3rd persons DNAon a stain and  a kidnapper certainly doesnt do ALL of the above A predator likewisedoesnt break in to molest a child inside her home and he sure doesnt stop to write a ransom note And if it helps to think through these observations replace the word kidnapper above with intruder,neutral
that smile just screams mentally unstable,neutral
she was so beautiful,positive
All I know is a mother and son have a very sick love I grew up the youngest of 4 children and the only girl My mother and her sons  my brothers had a very sick love where they could do no wrong I was abused physically on a regular basis by those brothers One broke my nose one gave me a concussion and one I spent the night in jail for trying to defend myself Then my mother picked me up from jail and made me go to school with no clean clothes no teeth brushing no hair brushed and no books I needed I was a freshman in high school Im 62 now my mother and father are dead I have absolutely no relationship with brothers and I do not wish them well,neutral
What in the hell is so funny wow this guy is a creep,neutral
Its funny they say the case will never be solved but Im sure it already has Im not sure which theory but one of them has to be right And most of the evidence points to the family Plus theyre wealthy so theres a good chance theyre covering it up,positive
The way he speaks about seeing his dead sister in her casketreally unsettling,negative
The girl is so beautiful They said this crime was unsolved but actually I think it already solved All the evidence are point to the family and especially the brother because his grandmother said before that there was one time when the brother get angry at jonbrnet he hit her with golf club so its possible that he is the one who kill Jobrnet by accident,neutral
smiling an awful lot maybe its his nature or this is a hard topic but even when someone is nervous or hiding emotions this smile is scary,negative
Kill her in the house and nobody hear nothing  I always believe was the brother  And parents protect him,neutral
Did you kill Jonhenet dadno momno did your son Ummmmm,neutral
what intruder kills a child practices  writes a 2 12 page ransom letter from paper  pen he retrieves in the house of his victim then leaves the body in the basement It just does not make any sense never have  never will common sense says Patsey went to her grave with that cover up Her eternity is now between her  her maker,neutral
The dad Hes a fake and a creep He may say words but it doesnt look like he means them,negative
If they been a black family or other minority like hispanic the case would have been solved by now and the family behind bars just like Madeleine McCann family,neutral

I would still be crying going crazy they just act like o I would do this and that bulshit they did it PERIOD,negative
They should do a lie detector test,neutral
I saw his interview when he was a kid The theories might be right that he killed his sister,neutral
Why is he smiling Is something wrong with him,negative
i dont think the brother did it I believe the dad did it and the mother wrote the note with the information from john in order to cover his tracks,neutral
someone knows something am i think its so sad what they did,negative
beauty pageants for children should be banned sickening,negative
I think his ass did it and the father went and got her to cover the son I think the brother was jealous because she got all the attention But was question is who tf sexually assault her,positive
Who done it 907 really,neutral
Burke reminds me of Elijah Wood in Sin City,neutral
Unsolved murder 20 yrs now BS we have the technology to solve this but no one is coming forth to do it so it remains unsolved,neutral
I think that guy is the killer of his own sister,positive
I pray the lord reveals this one day,neutral
I think the brother did it That satanic smile just look at his eyes,positive
What dad would say Jonbenet is a phedophile s dream come true OMG,positive
The fact hes smilinng throughout the whole thing really freaks me out,neutral
How is it he is smiling when talking about it Very strange I have wondered if he killed her and the entire coverup by his father and mother was to protect him,neutral
I believe that evidence could point to Burke killing his sister out of rage and so his parents covered this up to protect their last remaining child him I watched a documentary on the case This is just what I think and I could be wrong,neutral
What the HELLLLLL is he smiling  grimacing about I have now officially lost ALL RESPECT AND ADMIRATION for Phil,neutral
no one finds it fishy that the parents were extremely wealthy and owned a mansionbut had no security cameras,positive
Burk is liyng becuse i know burk hit her in the Head with a flashlight,neutral

How come they called 911 said that she was kidnapped and gone and later that day she was found in basement like did someone took her killed her and put back in house through that window or PARENTS DIDNT SEARCH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE TO FIND HER They were playing in that basement and they didnt remember to look if she is maybe there and no one think that is suspicious,neutral

Look around the house shit the police somebody was paid good money this makes me sick common sense come on now im furious,neutral

my theory the brother killed her by accident and the family covered it up for no trouble,neutral
Hes so creepyI thing he killed her I guess,neutral
The reason you never get this interview or get this information soon is because there had to be a cover up in order to hide evidence but in order for that to fade away you have to wait a long time like 20 years later xD,neutral
I WAAAAAANT THEM TO DO A LIE DETECTOR TEST AND I WANNA SEE,neutral
It is a GARROTE Pronunciation rt,neutral

Psychopath  That girl was so beautiful and she was alive she would have been so beautiful  Shes definitely in heaven and these lot will go hell,positive
When I look at him I remember about a sociopath mom who killed her older daughter and attempted to kill two more She was like that smiling and have no remorse,neutral

That whole family is involved in a b7nch of cult stuff Dad had a book about how to mind control with a stun gun and she had stun gun marks on her back Do the math,neutral
My point of view The father is a psychopath There is no sign of sadness at all when mentioning the daughters death He manipulated the daughter to gain fame and fortune of money He created all facts to cover up the truth of story He killed the daughter for some reasons maybe the daughter knew sth he did not want her to know He manipulated the brother to lie where the brother was uncomfortable  anxious in the interviews through threats and abuse The brother does not seem to be having traits of psychopath he was not as calm and controlled like psychopath While the mother finally realise the reality she was stuck with a psychopath and lost her beautiful daughter she had serious psychological issues and died from cancer years after the incident,neutral

I dont know man I think the family has to have done this,neutral
I wonder what dr Phills real thought of him were,neutral

We all know he did it,neutral
Burke said on Dr Phil he snuck downstairs after everyone went to sleep to play with a toy This would have been around the time of JonBenets death,neutral
Can people stop saying the brother did it I dont see anything suspicious about him They have DNA showing that it wasnt him and nothing linking him to her death Apart from the fact that he was in the house at the time And the way he is acting in the interview isnt weird you can tell he is very uncomfortable and anxious and thats why hes making that facial expression,negative

Narcissist and Psychopaths everything they are saying is classic and suspicious,neutral
In a recent video he did state that the killer stabbed her and said whoops so the theory that she was accidentally killed by her brother makes sense,neutral
Very simple mother didnt want to lose both kids so she covered for him,neutral
Poor baby deserves justice,negative

Its a cultreal deal cult that killed herbrother has been initiated as well,neutral
Whywhy is he smiling while describing her casketthis seems so wrong,negative
Nope He WAS TOO SMILING,neutral

Why can he not stop smiling,neutral
Id love to crush this guys skull w a baseball bat,positive

Que crueles pueden llegar a ser algunos seres humanos sacando conclusiones tan deliberadas,neutral
I dont think hes smiling because he did it hes probably so traumatized from what happened and is using that personality to cover up and protect how he really is inside and how he feels,neutral
Why does he keep smiling about his sisters death Its weird,negative
This is police corruption and the family did it one of them knows something,neutral
why doesnt he stop smilingwtf,neutral
He so did it The brother that it Watching the footage of him speaking as a kid when interviewed he clearly shows signs of narcissist boarder line personality and also is say sociopath,neutral
I think her brother is just traumatized I mean he thought he killed his own sister and then he had to see how his parents killed her sister straggled thats because he is smiling Otherwise I cant explain it,neutral
He broke no silence only continued the stone faced charade,neutral
If there was a dog or a cat in the house they also have been suspected,neutral
The brother killed the sister with a flashlight on purpose but he didnt know that it will instantly kill herThe family put up a fake act to avoid shame upon their name and the community,neutral
Whats with the creepy smile through the entire interview,neutral
I believe the brother has been abused and over sheltered Seems a bit simple minded,neutral
Why is this smiling I dont understand why he is smiling talking about his sisters murder,neutral
I think he did it and the parents did a coverup on it As for the unknown dna i call bullshit that lack of info alone got them away with it all,neutral
They would have lost 2 kids if they turned him in,neutral
Why must he smile like this Knowing he got away for murder,positive
Does anyone else find it creepy that he never stops smiling while discussing the death of his sister Just sayin,negative
Unless someone talks we will never know for sure,positive
Think about it if someone came inside from outside they would have taken her out that house Also there was no foot prints in the snow outside that belong to anyone before police got there,neutral
I would wager that Burke killed his sister and the parents stayed up all night figuring out how to stage a fake breakinransom note to cover their sons tracks All the evidence points to this,negative
HE WAS LITERALLY SMILING THE WHOLE TIME What the heck is he talking about uncomfortable yea ok,neutral
The Phase of Knowingya right,positive
My question is why is he smiling and why does he look like hes gonna laugh and why does he look so HAPPY I swear this boy is creepy like even the the other interviewer was like why is this man smiling Im like YES WHY This girl was only six so sad RIP angel,neutral

Has anyone dared to give the brother a polygraph Let me guessNo,neutral
It gavemea headache when they said her skull was fractured,neutral
okay in the time youre stressing about disappearing of your own child the stress and youre nervous you decide to go to the basement WTF why didnt he go there before police had come their daughter was disappeared and they didnt come to see if shes in the basement he knew she was there,neutral
People always judge when their on TV being interviewed Hes not an actor so maybe thats his defense mechanism His face looks like a permanent smile,positive
i think burke killed her and the parents are covering for him,neutral
I dont believe he did it The parents were involved in some deep satanic shit and this was probably a ritualsacrifice Sounds like both the kids were abused and MK ultra was practiced,neutral
Who did it,neutral
Idk if he was involved in the murder or not but he sure looks like he did Creepy af,neutral
Time to research the DNA,neutral
The investigators never brought up on how the murder could of escaped like through the basement window through the attic through the back door other windowsIt doesnt make any sense to me on why ppl would blame the parents for killing their own loved one and the brother is just very nervous and uncomfortable so thats how i know he didnt do it Theres only one thing the People missed and thats the escape i mean you never know,neutral
Why the hell is this guy smiling He seems a bit off,neutral
The smile is misleading Its a typical reaction to such a traumatic event psychologically speaking,neutral
A psychosocio path father and brother and a narcissist mother,neutral
I agree with the police force who tried to get them charged No question mama killed her and dad was a pedophile White best friend of dads was the first to be called on the phonenot the cops Right there guilty They set up the crime scene just like Dr Henry Lee said initially,neutral
And this had to be posted on my birthday,neutral
Those who have ready big shovels need to go digging in the Ramsey and Pastys family backgrounds to find links within the community Both John and Pasty were sexually abused as children themselves This is where the thread of truth can be picked up and followed Pure conjecture Tho its all like writing on the wall to me,neutral
He killed herHe is cain,neutral
He looks just like Patsy RIP to Patsy and JonBenet,neutral
Why is he smiling so much Its like this  she is dead like bro this is a sad moment,neutral
I dont see a smile wth hes a tool,positive
After seeing this program I have no doubt Burke either did it or knows who did,neutral
It was John Andrew Ramseynot the momdad or Burke,neutral
I havd been so interested in this case N d only way I can conclude is dat Burke hit his sister with d flashlight and his parents staged the entire thing to cover up his crime From d start till the last of you see every evidence it just points towards the family,neutral
That dupers grin tells me a lot about the brother,neutral
The ransom note was long long long winded Definitely it was a pedophile who did this brutal murder So why would the parents write a long note REMEMBER movie Baby Jane Its a movie about sibling rivalry,neutral
Trace or touch DNA can be found on brand new clothes from the people who make or ship it It is erroneous to clear or charge anyone based on it JonBenet ate pineapples the night she died it was found in her small intestine There was a bowl of pineapples with Patsy and Burkes finger prints on it at the scene but not JonBenets Burke was clearly eating pineapples that night which contradicts their testimony that he was in his bedroom the whole night There also was a large flashlight in the kitchen that if used as a weapon is consistent with the head trauma she suffered The marks on her neck are consistent with being poked by Burkes model train set tracks perhaps to try to wake her up Burke had anger issues he had hit JonBenet previously with a golf club in the face He also pooped in her bed and on her Christmas presents that night When a psychologist interviews Burke and shows him a photo of the bowl of pineapples Burke gets very fidgety and cannot identify what it is he acts as though he does not know what a bowl of pineapple is even though in the same interview he earlier said pineapples was one of his favorite fruits So we know JonBenet ate one of his pineapples likely grabbing it out of the bowl and that he had hit her before How would a kid with anger issues react to his little sister stealing his favorite fruit It appears Burke accidentally killed his little sister and then the parents staged it to look like a foreign faction did it It explains all the inconsistencies like why she was both struck dead and tied up and choked and sexually abused they wanted to make it look like a violent intruder or the extremely long and confusing note which includes multiple paraphrased movie quotes The basement of their house had movie posters hanging in it Patsy was ambidextrous and her handwriting was tested for her dominant hand but she easily could have used her other hand to make it look different Additionally John Ramsey said he had broke the glass in the window some weeks earlier and used it to get in the house when he had locked himself out it wasnt broken that night In the 911 call the muddled audio at the end can now be heard of the three of them talking in the kitchen before the call hangs up It appears to include John saying we are not talking to you  John and Patsy are not talking to Burke Then Patsy saying what did you do Help me Jesus asking Burke what he did Then a young boys voice clearly Burke saying what did you find This contradicts the familys testimony that Burke was in his room the whole night The parents had discovered that their older child struck and killed their younger child and in a panic decided to make it look like he hadnt done it to not lose both their children in a single night Lastly in 2013 a judge unsealed some grand jury documents related to the investigation Despite the District Attorney deciding to not bring charges it shows that the grand jury had voted to bring charges against the parents but not for murder The grand jury saw all the evidence and voted to indict John and Patsy on two counts endangering JonBenet and being accessories to a murderhiding evidence This is completely consistent with the grand jury charging the parents for allowing JonBenet to be near Burke who was a very troubled kid and for covering it up Yet the politicized DA who was friends with the Ramseys did nothing Theres little mystery left in this caseIn fact there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,neutral
After watching his interviews back when he was still around 10 or 11 I believe he is the one who killed his sister Maybe its not in his intention to kill but he is still the person responsible for what happened to the poor girl The family is very famous and their image of a happy family is something that they must protect at all cost so thats why the parents covered up for him The reason why he is not remorseful is because I bet his parents keep on telling him that its not his fault and that it was an accident but he must not tell the truth because he didnt mean to hurt his sister Burke is jealous of his sister One of their neighbors told the investigators that Burke once hit his sister on the face and that Burke never really played with other children in the neighborhood esp when JanBenett is around,neutral
I dont think he was smiling I agree it looks like an uncomfortable facial feature instead,negative
Hes parents covered him up,neutral
Hes smiling talking about seeing her corpse,neutral
burke 100 killed his little sister and we all know it after years of jealousy jonbenet stealing some pineapple from his bowl finally made him snap and he smashed her over the head with the flashlight that he knew was in the kitchen drawer his parents tried to cover it all up so they wouldnt be known as the ones with the murderous psycho kid its disgusting to see him sit there smiling like that makes me sick,negative
this is the creepiest interview ever,neutral
Burke is an evil creepy devil,negative
They stayed focused They screwed up big time,neutral
I honestly think Burke did it Nobody else besides family members were in the house The sad thing is this little girl knows exactly what happened to her and well never know Rip sweetheart,neutral
it angers me so much that this obvious killer is sitting here making money on his kill while he only got aways because of his parents money incredible,positive
PizzaGate FranklinScandal CookingSpirit *Connect the dots*,neutral
Fella sure creep smiles a lot,positive
Burke 100 killed her and his parents covered it over up because they didnt want to lose both children,neutral
That smile is spine chilling,neutral
You need to watch The Case Of Jonbenet Ramsey parts 12 I think their theory is spot on Jonbenet gets woken up to go to the toilet Afterwards she comes downstairs She takes a piece of pineapple from her brothers bowl He freaks out and hits her with a torch Unfortunately she dies and then his parents help cover it all up Theyre wealthy so they just pay the DA to keep quiet and to make it look like it was an intruder,neutral
Its not a smile it is an insane psycho smile,negative
he looks nervous and guilty,negative
what if the identified males dna in her underpants is her bothers,neutral

They paid this guy to defend him  I dont see a smile as much as I see an uncomfortableblah blah You yourself dont believe that Since youre a professional your insight influences others So they paid you to defend him and paint him as an shy guy when its clear he is sketchy af,neutral
202 someone probably paid him to smile  thats my opinion Maybe its not even the real Burke ,neutral
his eyes and smile creeps me out,positive
I hope I live long enough to know who did it,neutral
This is Just Sad  You can tell when someone is Guilty or have been up to no good They Cant look you in the Eye or are really Awkward to be around  And if the Ramseys did do it I ask how could you hit your own child or stage that someone broke into the house   For the Sake of God if You Loved your child like they Claim they Did then why did they if proven guilty kill her Its Soo Wrong  I believe Burke was jealous but I Do believe He Loved her I feel like her Father put her on a pedistool and Burke couldnt cope with it and So Patsy saw this and Completely Pampered him  And tried making him number one or Noticeable ,neutral
To be honest from day one I always felt like he did it It just best fits the evidence and parents behavior after I think it was sibling abuse that was going on awhile due to jealousy and that night it went too far The parents had to save the kid they had left So they staged the ligature and note She went willingly down there with whoever it was,neutral
the same blow of the skull laughing the hollow of his toy in the back he does not care the end of the call and the daddy the violo the mom could hit the cranium practicing and the mom scolded her and the mom got angry and hit her in the skull and the brother hated her and had her envy,negative
They overlooked a broken window Excelent police work,negative
I think Burke killed JonBenet Burke woke up hungry he went downstairs to get pineapple and milk JonBenet then woke up probably to use the bathroom or she woke up because she Peed on herself She saw a light on downstairs went downstairs to see what was going on She then saw her brother in the kitchen eating pineapple Then she went over grabbed it with her fingers and ate a piece Burke then got mad at JonBenet for eating his pineapple JonBenet then ran downstairs to the basement Burke went chasing after her grabbed the flashlight from the kitchen and ran downstairs Burke soon caught up with JonBenet then hit her with the flashlight on her head Burke then realized what he had done He then grabbed JonBenet and dragged her to the other room He then ran back upstairs went back in his room and pretended to fall asleep Patsy and her husband both woke up to the noise and checked the house and the rooms They both saw Burke in his bed sleeping and went to check JonBenets room and found her missing so they went to check around the house for her They then went down to the basement and checked the rooms and then found JonBenets body on the ground Patsy then screamed and Bourke got out of his bed and ran to the basement Then thats when they had their conversation what did you do Patsy were not talking to you John oh Jesus oh Jesus Patsy what did you findBurke Burke thought he was slick trying to play it off When he probably killed his sister Then the parents wanted to cover it up by strangling her even though she was already dead or slowly dying Or Burke could have done all of that to her then went upstairs I dont know I just want this solved Its very sad its taking over 20 years to solve this case,neutral
Trumps win is probably the biggest underdog story in history The media ripped him Hollywood ripped him the Democrats ripped him professors ripped and even his own party the Republicans ripped him a lot of the time And he still won Think whatever you want about him but you cant deny it was historic,positive

I am a 48 years old white woman I listen to classic rock I dont listen to his music and cant even name one song he sings but that last superfluous comment made by that news anchor was totally unprofessional classless and childish Lil Wayne was a guest on your show He didnt flip over his chair in anger or assault or threaten the woman interviewing her so whether you agree with him or not show some respect He is a guest in your home so have enough class to act like it You are not some late night talk show that talks about politics and uses satire and comedy writers for your show You are journalists and a media source that delivers a more serious newsmagazine show without comedy so you should stick to reporting news and remain impartial unbiased and neutral not say or do anything to sarcastically condescendingly and unnecessarily comment on how a guest you invited to your show behaved or responded to * *your* * questioning if Lil Waynes attitude could be perceived by anyone to be inappropriate the attitude displayed by your news anchor who spoke last was way worse than Lil Waynes attitude Its acceptable for Lil Wayne to express his opinion and objection to things Hello Thats what you are interviewing him for It is not however acceptable for your news anchor to express his displeasure or even disgust with how Lil Waynes expresses his opinion and objection to things WHEN THAT IS THE VERY OBJECTIVE OF CONDUCTING AN INTERVIEW AND WAS THE VERY REASON YOUR SHOW WAS INTERVIEWING HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE Just classless,neutral

*A COMMON MISCONCEPTION is that evolution should lead to some particular trait* such as a large brain There is no goal to evolution not speed not strength not intelligence and certainly not humanity Evolution is about one thing survival Evolution occurs at the molecular level Mutations occur with every cell division and replication in every living species Those mutations are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms It is the then current environment which wields the pruning shears favoring those mutations that best suit the organism for that environment Apes that stayed in the forest became todays chimps bonobos orangs and gorillas They are very well suited for their environments One that opted for the savanna faced different evolutionary pressures that set it on a different evolutionary trajectory The modern human brain is about 2 of total body mass yet is requires fully 20 of total caloric consumption I think you can understand that for most animals it is a daily challenge to consume enough calories just to survive and a larger brain would be more of a burden than an asset It is also the case that the larger human brain requires that babies be born at a less advanced stage of neural development placing an additional burden primarily on the mother Japanese researchers have compared brain scans of baby macaques chimps and human children and found that brain volume for both chimp and human babies increase at three times the rate of infant macaques however during early childhood human brain expansion was twice that of chimpanzees due to rapid growth of connections between brain cells In the human infant fully 60 of caloric intake go into neuronal development For just about any other species the necessity for such a long childhood would place them at a survival disadvantage We are just now beginning to understand the environmental pressures that lead to a larger brain increasingly complex social networks the development of language that enabled a culture built around tool manufacture and use and cooperative hunting no doubt played a role The challenges of a rapidly changing climate may also have been a contributing factor But if it had not been for the development of language humanity would have had to continuously reinvent the Acheulian Hand Axe Two factors allowing human speech are the hyoid bone also present in Neanderthals to which the muscles of the tongue are attached and a particular variant of the FOXP2 gene found in other mammals that allows for complex speech Humans share this variant with both Neanderthal and Denisovans indicating that it was inherited from a common ancestor Neither chimps bonobos or other apes have that variation indicating that it arose sometime after the species diverged So yes the human evolutionary history is indeed complex but as Richard Feinman said Science is the joy of finding things out We are getting a lot of clues as to the expansion of the human brain from embryology and comparative genomics but we see a progression in brain size from early mammals to primates to monkeys to apes and to humans It may be of interest to you to know that while most mammal brains are smooth primate brains have convolutions which increase the surface area of the cortex we see increased convolutions from monkeys to apes and more in humans See Molecular evolution of FOXP2 a gene involved in speech and language Wolfgang Enard Molly Przeworski Simon E Fisher Cecilia S L Lai Victor Wiebe Takashi Kitano Anthony P Monaco Svante Pbo Nature 418 869  872 22 Aug 2002 httpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalv418n6900fullnature01025html,neutral

*HOW EVOLUTION WORKS* It is helpful to understand that evolution is a molecular process The random mutations that naturally occur during cell division and replication mitosis and meiosis are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms Mutations are ongoing and continuous for every living species Those mutations are subjected to a selection process that is performed by whatever environment the organisms find themselves In this respect evolution is an ongoing continuous set of experiments Those that work get perpetuated those that dont perish It is as if the environment acted as an umpire who says There are good mutations and there are bad mutations and there are neutral mutations but they aint nuthin until I the environment calls em That is Natural Selection Neutral mutations just go along for the ride without producing immediate benefit Genetic Drift The result of those selection processes is organisms best suited for their current environment Should that environment change it would put the population under stress If the population gene pool has sufficient genetic variation it increases the likelihood that at least some offspring should be able to survive and perpetuate the species albeit one of slightly different genetic makeup What you should understand is that genetic changes do not occur because of some need The mutations are RANDOM and get selected if they are USEFUL That is a process and it is anything BUT random Lets take the example of the Panda Bears in general are omnivores eating plant matter but with a marked preference for meat when available The preferred food of the Panda however is bamboo leaves which have such low nutritional value that they must eat almost continuously The Panda would certainly be able to extract more nutrition with a four chambered stomach as in ungulates and whales or something akin to a cecal valve but it has neither in its genetic toolbox In feeding themselves pandas are continuously stripping bamboo leaves from their stalks a process that could be facilitated if they had a thumb Bears however do not have thumbs nor do they have genes for them in their genetic toolbox Nor do new features simply spring into existence However if a slightly altered body component provides some benefit natural selection will perpetuate it Evolution results in incremental alterations to what is already there As an analogy imagine a robot gardener dragging a hose around various obstacles it encounters in a garden until it can go no further Now an intelligent gardener could simply retrace his steps and take a different path avoiding those obstacles The robot gardener evolution is not an intelligent force and cannot do that With a limited tool kit it can only figuratively add more hose to get the job done While a thumb would be quite useful to a panda for stripping leaves evolution cannot rewind to produce one Instead it has taken a piece of hose a wrist bone and enlarged it to act as a stand in for a thumb That is not an elegant solution and not a perfect one but it gets the job done Evolution is does not produce perfect solutions but tweaks here and there to get the job done THAT is how evolution operates Based in part on the fact that no tetrapods terrestrial vertebrates exist in the fossil record prior to about 370 million years ago the Theory of Evolution would predict that tetrpods evolved from fish If that were the case there should have existed at one time a fish with characteristics of both fish and tetrapods In other words a Transitional Species Until about 2005 there was little evidence for such a creature There were however a class of fish called Sarcopterygians or Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian seas What charracterized those lobe finned fishes was that those fins were supported by external bones and muscles Those bones a single bone connected to two bones conncted to smaller bones are analogous to the limb bones of all tetrapods including humans Most Sarcopterygian Fishes have long been extinct but they are survied today by two species of coelacnth and six species of lungfish Still what was missing was a fossil showing characteristics of fish AND tetrapods When Neil Shubin and his team decided to search for a fossil that filled the gap between the Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian Seas and the earliest tetrapod fossils represented by Ichtheostega and Acanthostega dated about 370 mya Since those fossils were found in geologic deposits indicating a freshwater environment and if the Theory of Evolution is correct in its hypothesis that tetrapods evolved from fish then transitional fossils should be found in similar deposits somewhat older in age The problem was that geologic deposits of that age are exposed at few places on the earths surface Fortunately a great deal of geologic exploration has been done throughout the world financed often times by oil and mining interests They selected an area in the Canadian Arctic Ellesmere Island as having the greatest likelihood of success It took 4 years of searching during the short summers of that hostile environment but succeeded returning in 2004 with 9 specimens of the fish they named Tiktaalik It was exactly what one would expect a transitional fishtetrapod to look like and was found in deposits dated 375 mya If this was not the direct ancestor of tetrapods it was something very much like itThis is a great example of using evolutionary theory as a predictive tool The genetic variation within a population is referred to as a gene pool Organisms can move freely within that population breeding with each other perpetuating any new mutations that work and eliminating those that are less than optimalEach offspring will most resemble its parents yet will vary slightly genetically because of unique mutations acquired during meiosis Thus the genetic makeup of a population will change ever so slightly with each successive generation Populations are not stable they expand and contract with changing conditions So long as there is sufficient genetic variation within a population there will be some members capable of surviving those conditions and perpetuating the species The alternative is extinction When populations expand and migrate to new territories some portions of it will become genetically isolated from each other and no longer share a common gene pool In such cases each such sub population will carry a subset of the parent population but subsequent mutations will be unique to each new population the genotype that will come to differentiate that population from others Genetic Drift To the extent that such populations encounter differing environmental conditions that environment will exert different evolutionary pressures on that population New mutations will have a much greater chance of coming to dominance within a smaller population than they would in the larger parent population where they would be one among the many Over thousands of generations genetic differences accumulate in the different gene pools making interbreeding ever more difficult until at some point speciation can be said to have occurred Because speciation is a process rather than an event it would be no more possible to pinpoint where speciation occurred than to identify where on the color spectrum orange becomes red,neutral

*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  The Predictive Ability of the Theory  Part I* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions Perhaps the greatest tests for any theory is their use as a predictive tool and the Theory of Evolution does that beautifully The first fossils were discovered quite by accident incidental to some other human activity There are still fossils discovered that way but no paleontologist will count on accidental discoveries Expeditions seeking particular fossils are planned meticulously Fifty years ago creationists could derisively point to the fact that science had no transitional whale fossils But then with the aid of geologic maps funded in part by oil and mineral companies and the Theory of Evolution predicting when in geologic time such fossils were likely to be found paleontologists were able to locate where in the world the proper marine sediments were exposed at the earths surface As each new discovery came to light they each showed a range of features from inherited to derived Each was consistent with what would be expected if the theory was correct There was no evidence of a derived feature returning to a more primitive form No derived feature occurring out of place in the geologic record When Neil Shubin and his team sought a fossil with transitional features between fish and tetrapod they knew that the earliest tetrapod fossils were found in fresh water sediments dated about 370 million years ago It was reasonable to assume that a transitional fossil if such existed would most likely be found in similar sediments somewhat older perhaps those dated at about 375 mya Geologic maps indicated that there are few places in the world where such layers are exposed at the earths surface but one they deemed to have the greatest probability of success was on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic Not exactly ones ideal summer vacation spot It took four expeditions in the very short Arctic summers but they returned in 2004 with nine fossil specimens of a fish they named Tiktaalik It was a fish but a fish like no other It had scales gills and a swimming tail but it also had lungs a sturdy rib cage and muscular fins ideal for pushing through weedy shallow marshes Those fins had the same arrangement of bones found in land based animals One bone humerus forelimb or femur hind limb Two bones ulna and radius forelimb or tibia and fibula hind limb followed by metacarpals and phalanges Even more interesting was the flattened head with eyes on top whose focus would have been at or above the waters surface and a neck that allowed it to move its head without having to move its whole body Here was a Devonian fish capable of breathing air watching at the waters surface most likely for the insects and other arthropods that millions of years earlier had followed plants in colonizing the land Recent research has revealed that eyes are very expensive tissue in terms of calorie consumption That is why cave dwelling organisms are quite often blind The limited food sources in those caves are the environmental pressure for the elimination of superfluous tissue Experiments have shown that larger eyes only marginally improve underwater vision but can increase air vision 100 fold While we cannot for certain determine the eye size of extinct organisms the size of the eye socket provides a pretty good approximation Tiktaaliks eye sockets were quite large indicating it was most likely searching for prey above the waters surface This is a fish at the margin of land and water with many features that would have suited it on land We cannot be certain that this fish or its progeny was the ancestor of all tetrapods but if not it was something very similar to it As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The Theory of Evolution pointed to where such a fossil would be found and indeed it was,neutral

*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  Vestigial Human Traits* Vestigial refers to an organ or part which is greatly reduced from the original ancestral form and is no longer functional or is of reduced or altered function They are not necessarily useless as some people assume Just as humans inherit characteristics of their nearest relatives each of us has characteristics inherited from more distant relatives In the inner corners of your eyes you have what is called a semilunar fold or plica semilunaris There is a muscle attached to it but it doesnt do anything in humans In many other animals sharks frogs birds your cat however that muscle controls a transparent nictitating membrane or third eyelid that can be drawn over the eye Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic You also have three sets of muscles attached to your ears In other animals those muscles turn the ears to focus on the direction of a sound This ability is found in monkeys most of which cannot turn their head horizontally Humans and the other apes can turn their heads vertically and the ability to move the ears is largely lost in those species Using sensitive electronic devices researches find that the human brain is still sending nerve impulses to those muscles in response to sounds but the most any human can do is a bit of a wiggle Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic Then there is the Plantaris Muscle which in other primates facilitates arboreal lifestyle allowing the feet to function much the same as hands in gripping branches The human foot has lost this ability rather early on it seems in the process of becoming bipedal The muscle however is still there It is a long pencil thin muscle and tendons running down the back of the calf that are extremely painful when ruptured and often misdiagnosed as a more serious injury This injury often called Tennis Leg occurs most frequently in athletes over 40 due to the tendon and attachments becoming more brittle With or without treatment the two ends of the rupture will shrivel and disappear within weeks with no loss of function in the leg It is indeed one of evolutions leftovers It is often harvested for reconstructive surgery elsewhere in the body That these muscles are still present in the human body indicates that the genetic instructions for them are still present in the human genome and active to some extent At some point the genes for these traits may be silenced by a mutation that disables a gene such as a premature STOP codon or frame shift making them a pseudo gene one which no longer produces a protein There is evidence that is already happening as this muscle is absent in one leg or both in about 10 of the population The same seems to be happening with wisdom teeth In the wild primate infants are capable of grasping and holding on to the mothers fur shortly after birth allowing the mother to pursue other activities Human infants because of the limited birth canal and large human brain must enter this world at a much earlier stage of physical and neuronal development Despite that the developing human embryo exhibits a grasping reflex in the uterus as early as 16 weeks Even at birth that reflex the Palmar Grip Reflex is incredibly strong as most parents of newborns will attest While it is capable of supporting the childs weight one must exercise caution as the child may suddenly let go This reflex may persist up to 6 months after birth As this is of no benefit to a human child it is vestigial All Great Apes including humans have an appendix In other apes the appendix is quite large and a repository for bacteria which help to digest the leaves that make up a large part of their diet In humans it is called the vermiform worm shaped appendix and is minuscule While some hypothesize that our appendix is a repository for good bacteria to replenish out gut biota following diarrhea the fact is that a hot appendix can kill you whereas those who have had it removed go on to lead normal lives The vomeronasal organ VNO is an organ located at the base of the dividing wall between right and left nostrils nasal septum It is present in most amphibia reptiles and mammals but absent in birds and adult Old World catarrhine monkeys which include apes and humans It enables the detection of pheromones via pheromone receptor VR genes that produce proteins sensitive to certain biochemical signals The VNO is clearly present in the human fetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults and is thus vestigial The VR genes plentiful in other species while present in the human genome are all or almost all disabled by mutations making them pseudogenes again vestigial remnants Pseudogenes are vestiges of previously active genes that have been disabled by some mutation and no longer produce a protein There are some 20000 of them n the human genome many of them remnants of Olfactory Receptor scent receptor genes While humans have lost an additional 30 of these genes since our ancestral lineage separated from that of chimps most of those pseudogenes are handmedowns from even more remote relatives but disabled by exactly the same mutations again evidence of common ancestry We see vestigial structures all through nature They remain in some cases because they have been adapted for other purposes in others they remain simply because there has been no evolutionary advantage to eliminating them They certainly do not support the idea of intelligent design They are however completely consistent with the Theory of Evolution,neutral

So a group of the earliest hunter gatherers were standing at the mouth of a cave watching a heavy thunderstorm Lightening struck a nearby tree and all but one man scrambled for shelter deeper into the cave Uhhg was a tad less frightened he had seen lightening strikes before In fact Uhhg approached the tree and picked up a branch that was aflame Soon the others found their courage and gathered around Uhhg They were praising the obvious courage he had displayed in not running for his life Uhhg was a smart feller He said that a voice had commanded him to remain when the others fled The voice told him that the fire was heaven sent and as long as it burnt Uhhgs people would prosper Uhhg said the voice had instructed him to keep the holy fire burning The voice also said the men would go on a hunt and that hunt would be successful The best of the meat was to be given to Uhhg to make an offering to the voice that only he could hear The men gathered wood for the holy fire They went on the hunt and left Uhhg to commune with the voice Thus was born religion As societies evolved so did religion Christians laugh at ancient Greek and Roman religions and insist they were based on myths Yet Christian beliefs hang upon a talking serpent a talking burning bush and a boat that held two of every species Religion was conceived to control the masses Nothing has changed except the numbers involved It is still all about wealth and power,neutral

My original post seems to have been taken down for some reason who removes a post promoting peace Heres a repost I think some things should be cleared up Firstly evolution is not we evolved from apes That makes no sense and has no evidence Evolution of humans is to say that we evolved from an ancestor in common with apes over a very long period of time millions and millions of years In other words that common ancestor was one we had a very long time ago and not a species that is alive today and can be identified Also people often inaccurately characterize a theory as an idea that hasnt been proven yet which is also false A scientific theory is an explanation for something a scientific law which is what people assume to be a proven theory is a description of something we observe But people will believe what they believe by heart or mind by tradition or simply by the enormous number of world influences which have led us to stick to stable and unvarying opinions Ultimately all that matters is that we can agree to live by good moral principles and with common purpose So when atheists in this comments section for example tell theists to kill themselves they arent doing much good to justify their beliefs Or conversely when theists tell atheists they are superior to all other life and that atheists will suffer the wrath of God clearly they do not fully comprehend the advocacy for love and forgiveness by their own faith I implore both atheists and theists to leave an open mind to the others perspective because really we cannot yet prove who is correct on the creation of the universe beyond minor evidence and faith though it is a goal of humanity to solve this impossible question eventually To finish with a quote by Marcus Aurelius Live a good life If there are Gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by If there are Gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them If there are no Gods then you will be gone but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and I might add it is not divisiveness but togetherness which will in the end determine exactly how the human race perseveres and what direction we take in our final departure away from the pale blue dot Live with happiness and magnanimity overcome your red sorrows and embrace others even those you would otherwise consider to be enemies Then it does not matter who is right or wrong we will have transcended the greatest of moral barriers Ssschah,neutral

*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  Evolution Makes Testable Predictions* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions In the 1950s when it was discovered that humans had 23 pairs of chromosomes one from each parent whereas the other great apes chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans had 24 pairs creationists were ecstatic thinking they finally had evidence to counter common ancestry Chromosomes are packages of DNA that form during mitosis and meiosisThere are two sets one inherited from each parent Other Great Apes have 48 chromosomes 24 pairs 1n24 2n48 whereas humans have 46 chromosomes 23 pairs 1n23 2n46 Evolution made a testable prediction That somewhere in the human genome we should find evidence of cromosomal fusion In other words we should be able to find a human chromosome with the remnants of extra telomeres and centomeres Since the loss of all the genes in a chromosome would have been fatal to any species scientists reasoned that IF the Theory of Evolution was correct about common ancestry one of two things must have occurred Either two chromosomes had fused in humans evolutionary past OR chromosomes had split in the other apes Using Occams Razor or the law of parsimony which states that among competing hypotheses the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected Simply put it means that the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one the most likely event was chromosome fusion in humans Normal chromosomes have a centromere and ends capped with telomeres It was reasoned that IF two chromosomes had fused evidence for such an event would be found in a chromosome with two centromeres and teleomeres where they did not belong That is exactly what was found in human chromosome 2 chromosomes are numbered by length It was subsequently discovered that chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 for comparative purposes designated as 2A and 2B or 2p and 2q contained the same genes as human chromosome 2 and if placed end to end the positions of those genes matched those of the human chromosome Those chromosomes in the other apes also lined up in a similar fashion The fusion event has been confirmed In just the last few years science has gained largely complete genomes of two other human species those of Neanderthal and Denisovans We see that same chromosome fusion in their genomes as well indication that the fusion event took place in a common ancestor As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The greatest test of ANY scientific theory is in its usefulness as a predictive tool In this case as with others the Theory of Evolution has performed beautifully,neutral

I hate to see highly intelligent creatures in captivity A crab would eat its mother and doesnt care about anything as long as its kept well fed but highly intelligent and social animals in captivity break my heart Sea mammals dolphins for instance social and affectionate creatures used for entertainment purposes so that people can interact with them and take cute pictures that has to stop,neutral

What would would we do without Vox,neutral
It is impossible to keep a great white in captivity because of the sharks size and the fact they must keep moving due to their size and the way they sleep when they sleep its gliding through the water towards the bottom at an angle these sharks can grow to 23ft in length and the girth on these animals is phenomenal they may last in captivity anywhere from 35 days depending on the size and depth of aquarium these animals must remain in the open ocean to live not in a aquarium where their lifespan will be cut short these are magnificent animals and we can appreciate them better by leaving them where they are free in the ocean,neutral

This is just the folly of human hubris Mother nature Hey so this shark is such a way that it needs to constantly roam long distances to stay healthy and productive Humanity Yeah but i want it in a tank comparable to an Olympic sized swimming pool Kids want to look at it Mother nature Well Im sorry but thats just not how things have worked out Humanity Yeah but I want it,neutral

The only Good SHark is a Dead Shark Period,neutral
Ethics No Well alright then,neutral
How aboutleaving them alone,neutral
This makes me so sad Just let the sharks live in the ocean instead of risking their lives showing them to people,neutral
Dont great whites travel in almost straight lines while almost asleep so maybe they bump in the tan because they are trying to do that and so barely sleep and then die,positive
Dude sounds like Microsoft Sam 108,neutral
I saw the Great White at Steinhart Really something to see The tank they had it in was called The Roundabout a circular tank actually a circle within a circle where the shark could just swim and never run into a wall like swimming in a giant buntcake pan I dont know how long it was there buy not very long I was glad to have gotten the chance to see it,neutral
Hey I live by the Monterey bay aquarium,neutral
Freedom fighters,neutral
How about just leaving them alone Just my two cents,neutral
thanks for the interesting information lets leave these amazing creature in mother ocean were they belong and take the time to see them in their environment and protect that environment,positive
Sounds way too complicated Lets just let them be,negative
Just seeing a picture of this shark seriously unnerves me,negative
I doubt that shark can be domesticated ever,neutral

The Great White It bravely hunts alone and would rather be dead then captured more honor than those vile zerging cry baby Orcas,positive
It dies short after it was released well of course not being sure why is just lazy captivity kills,neutral
You didnt actually say why The answer is sharks use echolocation In an aquarium setting where people are often bumping into or tapping the glass is disrupts the sharks ability to use echolocation and they run into the glass or get confused Basically they starve or just injure themselves and die,neutral
Stop kidnapping living beings and taking them to their death for your amusement Theyre not playthings,neutral
If they die being in captivity than why continue to try it Theres no reason to have them in the first place,neutral
notice electric trail yet function road English nowhere district publicly,neutral
Damn guys just chill You dont HAVE to capture every animal,neutral
Tbh the only actual acceptable reason to keep these things in captivity is for research and other scientific examination,neutral
Its simple Great Whites are predators not entertainers,positive
My question is why I dont understand the desperate need to capture something to display it,negative
At 130 wait im about 10 mins away from there and ive been there and seen the shark,neutral
Ive seen the great white in the Monterey Bay Aquarium in 2011 That was the first time I saw a great white,positive

why did this video make me feel sad for sharks,negative
It doesnt work just stop,neutral
Buwahahaaa its simple why  Omg educate yourself vox  Great whites are connected to the natural magnetic field of the earth When it goes into captivity the mag field is lost ,positive
Didnt know about this Thanks though,neutral
yeah i have been wondering why,neutral

I saw the great white shark at the Monterey Bay Aquarium So amazing It commanded respect So beautiful,positive
if many other aquatic museums followed ethic customs such as these then there wouldnt be as many issues,neutral
As an alien from Fornax VII weve had similar problems maintaining humans in tanks They die after a couple of weeks even after we added Axe Body Lotion to their water supply They stop eating and breathing so quickly We mixed fertilizer into their diets and kept their nail beds at 400 hundred degrees but nothing works Eventually with enough research we should be able to display a juvenile for more than a year,neutral
May be they r smart n proud They suicide in captivity,positive
To the people saying this is horrible Im sorry but its human nature to gain a profit from something It probably wont change,negative

How disappointing I thought I was going to hear theyd become extinct ,negative
Aquariums should be shut down,neutral
what if water flowed thru the tank like a wind tunnel,neutral
RIP to all the animals who died,neutral
C as n yhey just leave these wonderful fish in the ocean before there numbers dwindle down to near extinct,neutral
This is inhumane,negative
How about we put humans in tankscages and put them in the ocean so sharks and other marine lifeforms can view them as an attraction like what we are doing to them,neutral
Just Leave the sharks alone,neutral
What they have it because i said they do,neutral
Just leave those poor animals alone God humans disgust me sometimes Maybe one day aliens will kidnap us for display back on their home planets,neutral
It will eat the aquarium thats why,neutral
Your putting sharks in jail just so people can see them Sounds fair,positive
just leave those damn sharks alone lmao,positive
You know they are becoming an endangered species people Stop catching them,positive
Just build an underwater aquarium instead,neutral
As much as sharks scare me it made me kinda sad when they said they wouldnt eat or they needed help swimming Poor things,neutral
they dont do that very passionate,neutral
I thought the video was finished when the Vox logo appeared after one minute,neutral
Sharks are my favourite animalsif they die Ill be very sad edit if they die out and dont exist anymore,negative
SO WAIT WHY ARE THEY DYING,neutral
They are making efforts in caging a shark Ugh just stop,neutral
And theres a new movie The Meg,neutral
At least they tried to do it as safely as possible I was surprised that they released them at all I thought they just kept letting them die,neutral
VOX filmed it like it doesnt matter this shark aquarium need to be ended,neutral
This is so sad,negative
right after I move away from Okinawa they get a great white smh,positive
Hmm stylistically a VICE rip off,neutral
The best thing to do is leave them alone they dont belong inside a water tank they belong in their regular nature water they are in custom to leave these wild animals alone,positive
I have no desire to see a shark up close and Im pretty sure the shark feels the same way about me We need to learn to leave nature alone to do what shes done for millenia with or without us around,neutral
Granted I can see yall point saying its kinda cruel and detrimental to keep killing these increasingly rare animals trying to keep them but theres a reason behind the madness First research Its a lot easier to study an animal in captivity as you have 24 hr access thats not hampered by weather hazards ornot being able to find a freaking shark big ocean you know Two conservation Yes it sounds ass backwards killing an animal to save it but they were trying to see if they could keep a shark in a secure location safe from illegal fishing wheremaybethey could breed it Its a pity they werent able to keep it though Perhaps in the future well figure out a better solution thatll help further these goals For now hope we can save the enviroment its living in and crack down on the fin trade,neutral
Leave them tf alone subhumans,neutral
This makes me so angry Leave them alone,negative
Robot sharks problem solved Compile behaviour from recordings of same species,neutral
just dont the fact that they die easily means they should not be taken captive,positive
New Orleans aquarium has one,neutral
I have a hypothesis on why they are dying For breathing sharks swim all the time even when they are asleep While in the aquarium they are not able to sleep as they hit the the walls of the aquarium This might be the reason why there are bruises near their nostrils,neutral
434 It flew so high you could see the earths curve Flat earthers Triggered,neutral
To minimise drag it soarer so high you could see the Earths curve Take that Flat Earthers,neutral
Not sure how a plane that flew successfully for almost 30 years could be considered a fail,neutral
Because they didnt thank the plane driver,neutral
*Comorde takes about 35 hours to London* *_Gravity you think im a joke to you_*,neutral
The reason that supersonic passenger aircrafts failed is because the pilot would announce that theyre taking off and the passengers would hear that message after the plane landed,negative
348 thank me later,neutral
Easily one of the best planes of all time and definitely an example of what we can achieve as a collective species when were not all insulting and killing each other,neutral
*American Airlines has left the chat*,neutral
747 s crashed so many times but nobody banned them why did they ban concorde just because of 1 crash 50 years ago in 1970s you can fly supersonic fron london to NY in 35 hours in 2019 its 8 hrs 15 minutes this is stupid,neutral
the Concorde featured a droop snoot Droop Snoot  the Snoot would Droop the Snoot Drooped THE BEST DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR EVER,positive

Short Summary of the video 1 Cost of the plane 2 Noise when the plane is flying at supersonic speed,neutral
This beautiful creature which you could hear coming from miles away would fly over my house in London every day at the same time and every one around would stop and look up and watch her roar past not only did you see her you also felt her and this always made me smile,positive
Has it not taken the titanic 106 years and counting to cross the Atlantic,neutral
The snoot drooped,neutral
At 040 Vox which one are you looking at Me I am looking at United Airlines and their failures and totally not Concorde buttering the bread on the landing,neutral
The Crash was not due to Concorde Tyres was it Absolute tripe If youre hurtling down the runway at 250mph and you run over a shard of metal 17 inches long off the intake of a Douglas DC10 that took off a minute before your tyre is going to burst There had been blowouts on Concorde before but more than any other aircraft at the time Because the Concorde had a fast takeoff speed a blowout was more likely to cause damage to the air frame AirFrance did not correctly Fuel the Aircraft They overfilled the fuel tanks and exceeded the MTOW of the plane As an aeronautical engineer I find this surprising because this is a number fundamental to the design and certification of any aircraft So essentially Air France was responsible as well as the Operator of the DC10 You could argue the DC10 was a flawed design It had many crashes where parts would fall off it The Manufacturing Quality of the DC10 was abysmal The DC10 was only 5 years older than Concorde It has so far been in 55 Accidents 32 of which were complete losses and has killed 1261 people Thank god it is not in operational Service They should have Grounded the DC10 as well when Concorde crashed Bits falling off it constantly In Conclusion Vox are terrible Journalists,neutral
It flew so high you could see the earths curve well no wander flat earthers exist They took this plane away,neutral
Stupid title The Concorde did NOT fail  The human failed in not making another supersonic passenger aircraft,negative
137 hours Excuse me but the Titanic has yet to cross the Atlantic at all,neutral
You failed to note that the debris left on the runway by a Continental Airways DC10 that had an inappropriate repair done was the immediate cause of the accident It was not exclusively a tire design fault on the Concorde I also doubt that the presence of a Flight Engineer was much of a factor in the retirement given the fares charged their salary would be trivial,neutral

I flew with it as a child Sad it is not operating anyomore,negative
They shouldve done a connection in a couple airports off the coast,neutral
i remember seeing concorde set off when i was like 5 and i cried at how loud it was,neutral
It didnt fail The British government refused to fund it anymore It was expensive It was making a loss Thats pretty much it I love the mention of Chuck Jaeger in there so America got a little bit of credibility in the video but everybody knows Britain designed the plane he flew in and indeed unofficially Britain had already broken the sound barrier first but our government suppressed it and to get vital financial deals in other areas our government LET the USA win the sound race When Concorde first flew to the USA people there complained in every way possible and mostly out of sour grapes because Britain along with France did it first without any American technology,neutral
If Boeing made this plane the US wont be complaining,neutral
Just in the comment section looking for triggered flatearthers,neutral
We miss you concorde the emperor of the skies,neutral
Absolutely amazing aircraft Pure beauty NOT made by computers but a human brain,positive
447 He dreams of rain He dreams of gardens in the desert sand He wakes in vain  He dreams of love as time runs through my hand He dreams of fire those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire and in the flames her shadows play in the shape of a mans desire His desert rose each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower no sweet perfume ever tortured him more than this And as she turns  this way she moves in the logic of all his dreams this fire burns he realize that nothings as it seems,neutral
Another reason Concord failed is because it did not have TVs,negative
Poor Frane Selak is on the plane when the tire fails He survives,negative
526 It wasnt the tires fault The runway had debris a titanium alloy that fell from the engine of a DC10 aircraft that took off on the same runway minutes before That metal piece punctured the tire and bounced onto the wing where the fuel tank is causing a fire at takeoff Youd think they do more research before making a short documentary about the concorde,neutral
Because of angled landing the Concord featured a droop snoot A droop snoot Yeah the snoot would droop The snoot drooped You see this is truly the real reason as to why this needs to be brought back,neutral
520 the airline that my youngest brother and my mother flew on to Montpellier to attend the Battle of the Year a breakdancing title He came in 5th place as the sole juvenile squad in the title,neutral
The answer why this program failed is complicated only for complete morons The answer is simple as that the game players from FAA did everything they could to sabotage this program from day oneand finally succeeded I spent 35 years of my life in the cockpit so I know this from my own experience,neutral
man i wish i had traveled in that beast,neutral
Id rather be uncomfortable for three and a half hours than slightly less uncomfortable for seven hours,negative
this plane could cross the Atlantic in 35 hrs IN 1976 AT MACH 22 1354 MPH it could go faster but the airframe would melt the jet expanded by 1 ft or 300mm at cruising altitude  No Pentium chips all analogue and nothing has come close and it was BRITISH  sadly missed gathering dust in the Smithsonians,neutral

We should still have a faster then sound supersonic plane Its nonscene not to have a plane that can be quick and go fast today in our modern era If they had wanted to upgrade that plane they could of I dont think it failed I think the people running it where lazy and cheap,neutral
Sting Im an English man in Concorde,neutral
I do wish someone would try this again,neutral

Comment section *Take that flat earthers*,neutral
I can tell whoever wrote this was a big fan of the phrase droop snoot,neutral
Wait so they could fly higher so the sonic boom wouldnt affect people,positive
When the concord lands it looks like a huge bird of prey swooping down on its victim,neutral
My Aunt rode on this plane twice and she said it was not very loud in the cabin Also she said it was a very enjoyable trip,positive
The internet is also part of the reason why a new Concorde is unlikely for awhile Concorde flights were mostly for business because companies could afford to pay the higher ticket prices It is much cheaper to just use a webcam and telecommute meetings than to fly 4000 miles,neutral
Concorde was a technological wonder which was taken out of action everywhere because of one crash and the noise Using that logic why isnt the regular passenger plane banned as that has crashed thousands of times before and it is also very loud Gotta love that logic,neutral
A jaw droping droop snoot had me quaking for some reason lmfao,neutral
They still land like a Ryanair though Ryanair couldve talen iy although it would become a total fail but still,negative
So what your telling me is Europe is better,positive
please remember concord was 1 of the safest planes ever it was down to a dc10 that shot this bird down,neutral
IT FAILED BECAUSE THIS PLANE WAS THE OBJECT TO PROVE FLAT EARTH,negative
Concorde was the most successful Jet passenger plane to cruise at twice the speed of sound and in its 27 years of service performing this task routinely  that achievement will not be repeated in our life time For British Airways  it was by far  the safest Aircraft on record and the word successful is a more appropriate  in technical terms,positive
Such a PROFESSIONAL video Thank you,neutral
i guess mars colonization has no better future,neutral
what went wrong *next frame showing smoking hole in the ground* oh yea,negative
It was 60s technology and uneconomical to operate Production costs were written off by the government so effectively they didnt cost BA anything to purchase,positive
No mention that Concorde had a habit of losing occasionally losing rudder panels inflight,neutral
Concordes Engine was made in the UK and US Rolls Royce,neutral
I flew on this aircraft in 1999 It was a incredible experience I woke up one morning and realized it was just a dreamlol,positive
I am really glad that my parents tore me out of bed at the age of six in 1996 to go to Sola Airport in Stavanger Norway and watch a Concorde land A unique experience unattainable today a memory I will keep forever,positive

Dammit DC10,neutral
People say it was not ECONOMICAL Well if you valued your time and had to sign a multi million dollar deal in the usa and had to be back for dinner in uk it makes a lot of sense The concorde was reserved for a NICHE MARKET of SUPER RICH not for cattle class flying,neutral

claims it went so high you can see earths curve yet no photos or video of the curve lmfao,neutral
As a French i remember that plane and the day of the crash on the news I think we should create project Concorde 2 in coalition with Brits When we do not wage war on each other we create the best weather the Concorde or the tunnel under the channel just marvel of engineering ,positive
Fun fact due to the highspeed of travel and the droop snoot design the cockpit actually expanded during flight During flight you could put your hand in a gap between two panels a gap that didnt exist when parked on ground,neutral
I watched the concord takeoff from mascot airport sydney Australia many years ago  it shook the ground  was amazing,positive
Why did it fail How utterly moronic It flew for almost 3 decades and remains one of mans greatest technical achievements,neutral

Wow so as a retired Aerospace Engineer I didnt use computers in the 70s or 80s Thanks for telling me,neutral

It should have flown the Pacific  Australia and New Zealand would have benefited,neutral
The Concorde crash was not the Concordes fault The plane that took of before it dropped a big metal piece Any aircraft would fail,negative
That plane was a POS I used to hear them when they took off and I can tell you from personal experience you would NOT love it,neutral
Theres nothing funny about Droop Snoots,neutral
Concorde didnt fail it just became too expensive to maintain,negative
Seen one on guam land and take off in 88was very cool,positive
I dont mind the time spent on flights once Im in the seat Sure its far from perfect but weve got our devices now to choose our work or entertainment and its a small price to pay to bounce around the globe On the other hand the airport experience from the freeway exit to get to the departing airport all the way to picking up the rental car at the other end of the trip is utter bullshit that needs a huge technological overhaul,neutral

Easy question too expensive to maintain and tickets were too costly,neutral
Because nobody could sleep through such a short journey and speed,neutral
TLDR The Concorde stopped flying because it was insanely expensive to operate The price of a ticket from JFK to Heathrow cost more than a firstclass ticket from JFK to Tokyo and you didnt get as much legroom as you wouldve on that flight to Tokyo either The Concorde _devoured_ fuel and its supersonicoptimized shape made it very dangerous to takeoff and land in bad weather,negative

Oh the cute little lie it was due to a problem specific to Concordes tires Nope Investigations proved a DC10 from Continental Airlines lost a one foot and a half long titanium part from its thrust reverser on the runway on which concorde rolled which destroyed a wheel and projected some parts of it under its wing which damaged a fuel tank and caused other problems that put the plane on fire On a side note there were several events of this kind during the carrier of the plane all around the world,neutral

Concorde only carried 100 passengers  tickets cost around 3 times the price of first class it was also early 60s technology  used lots of fuel,neutral

Well theres still one concorde that is runningUS Air Force B1 bomber,neutral
Concorde was a great aircraft and a legend in its own time however there were issues with this aircraft that were not publicized 1 Many times the aircraft landed in New York on reserve fuel and basically fumes in the fuel tank 2 One landing in New York found the Rudder sheared almost completely away The crew experianced a vibration through out the flight Many other situations occured on the aircraft with no incident Thank the good Lord,positive

what a machine but a ticket would cost you a small fortune,negative
One piece of very important information this video did not include was that when it mentioned that Concorde punctured a tire at 516 the puncture was actually caused by a metal piece that fell off from an aircraft taken off prior to Concordes departure The tire puncture was not actually Concordes fault In other words the Concorde was too good for its generation that it was required to be grounded,neutral

Back in the 1970s I was involved with a costbenefit analysis of Concorde and the overwhelming result showed that 1 it was too expensive to run 2 It could not carry enough passengers to make it viable 3 It was aimed at an elitist clientelle with lots of money to spare 4 way out of the reach of most travellers 5 the reason the Americans did not build it was they realised that the future lay in producing aircraft that could carry hundreds of people economically planes like the European A380  Technically it was a brilliant aircraft but commercially it was a white elephant,neutral

But why did this supersonic plane fail Uhbecause it blew up,negative
From the evidence presented it seems highly likely that deficiencies were apparent due to proboscis flaccidity Otherwise known as a Drooping Snoot,neutral
The Best Passenger Supersonic carrier in the world,positive
I think the premise is false I would argue that the Concorde was not a failure at all The fact that it was in service from 1976 to 2003 27 years and experienced only one catastrophic accident was a tribute to how robust the aircraft was especially given all the advanced features it employed The retirement of the Concorde was due mostly to external factors related to changes in air travel in general global economic factors and increasing maintenance costs There was nothing wrong with the airframe itself save for a design flaw in the landing gear a flaw that ended up leading to the Air France 4590 accident Had the economic outlook been better its possible that the gear issue would have been fixed and they would still be flying today,neutral

527 that is actually wrong a Continental Airlines DC10 lost a piece of the engine cowl the piece was run over by concord causing it to blow a tire the tire piece then stuck the delta wing causing a shock wave in the fuel and for the tank to be blown open Concorde was already committed to takeoff by this point a resulting fire from leaking fuel burned off the Concords control surfaces and it was unable to return for landing or make it to next airport,negative

All those concerns about noise and ozone by the FAA and others US administrations are just bullshits The only purpose was protectionism Boeing and Lockheed failed to design and produce a supersonic airliner thats why all these craps came up just to make sure than no US airline company buys Concorde And it worked after the ban of civilian supersonic flights above US territory all the US airlines companies canceled their Concorde preorders You dont hear any sonic boom on the ground when the plane flies at 60000 ft And that ozone concern A threat to the ozone seriously  No proof Meanwhile the heavy damages done by CFC gas to the ozone were already known at that time and the US did nothing to stop the production until they signed the Montreal protocol in 1987,neutral

Thank You for posting this video Funny how drivers in Europe automatically get this and move to the right without getting offended A simple flash of your headlights for someone to please more over and let them by is as common as holding the door open for someone Keep right except to pass people Its called common sense,neutral
imagine you driving that slow on the left lane on the German autobahn and another guy behind you is coming at you doing 200kmh,neutral
My favorite thing is when I go in the right lane wiht a cozy speed not under the limit someone catches up to me with very little speed difference moves into the left lane with the same speed I keep my speed too or maybe slow down a bit to make the takeover easier and this car just drives behind me for 10km 6 miles or more Guys if you want to pass pass if you dont stay in the right lane And if you pass dont slow down below the speed of the car you just passed,neutral
I thought this was common sense guess not,negative
I once talked to someone who was staying in the left lane matching speed with the right for miles and miles The conversation went something like this Me The left lane is for passing Once youre past someone you get back in the right Him No its the fast lane I can stay in it because I was going fast Me but you werent even Him Yes I was Please use the term passing lane It leaves no room for ambiguity,neutral

The number of people that continue to argue against this concept is astonishing Why would you disagree with a proven method that creates safer conditions and reduces traffic on our roadways I guess theres no cure for ignorance and stupidity no matter how much evidence you throw at these morons,neutral

Wait isnt left lane is for slow vehicles Oh this is right driving countries,neutral
We have this in Victoria Australia but only on freeways and country highways and you have to stay in the left not right,neutral
This obviously isnt common sense or there wouldnt be a problem The problem is that Drivers Education DOESNT teach this and some people dont logically understand the concepts of flow dynamics Some people well let me rephrase that MANY PEOPLE are just completely inconsiderate and thoughtless and think that the road was built entirely for THEIR use only The roads were built for A LOT of people and the more CONSIDERATE we all are of those people the better things will be not just roads either This video is good because it at least STARTS the process of reorganizing how people think about it I would consider passing this video along to more people and then TALKING about it to more people This CONSIDERATION concept is WAY more important than most would tend to believe I think,positive
Theres a special place in hell reserved for people who drive slow in the left lane,neutral
Earlier this week I saw cars blocking the left and center lanes which backed up traffic about a quarter mile I was worried that I was about to witness a massive pileup Speed limit advocates have a good point but the fact is they cant control what some drivers do when they see an opening So get the  out of their way and keep our roads  YOUR roads  safer Thank you Sincerely someone who doesnt even NEED to go into the left lane PS You enter the highway on the right You exit on the right If you have to you can stay in the center lane so you dont have to deal with the aforementioned right lane traffic entering the highway Why do you need to go all the way to the left,neutral

Atleast you have lanes that people actually follow In India people own the car the road theyve passed the road they are driving on and even the upcoming road Let the red light show 10 seconds remaining and hear the honks of a few people Let it turn green and see the reaction time of 000001 sec I am generally not sexist or racist but it is my general observation that female drivers although drive good enough for their safety but do not have any idea about other people and how to overtake safely Teenage boys also dont have any fear for their life or anyone elses Youll hardly see anyone on your entire trip with a helmet,neutral

Either people are ignorant of the law or think they dont have to obey it because they dont like it Plus law enforcement doesnt enforce it because theyd never be doing anything else but writting citations for an infraction that doesnt cost that much However the number of accidents that hurt some and kill others because people arent smart enough to stay by nature Merritts a butt ton of very clear highway signs like speed limit signs posting this law,neutral
Here in the Indiana the left lanes arent so much Passing lanes as they are fast lanes especially on roads with more than 4 lanes The left lanes do move faster but more often than not people tend to stay in the left lanes as opposed to simply using them to pass The end result is that you get lots of people who will CASUALLY pass on the right Not even making statement passes just causally passing on the right Ive been in several nearmisses on roads that have more than 4 lanes where another person tries to merge into the same lane that Im trying to merge into And yes Ill admit that I casually pass on the right far more often than I should,neutral

Finally someone mentioned this big issue I was raised in Mexico a country with wild drivers within the city However common education prevents unexperienced drivers to use the highway unless you know defensive driving I have faced this issue within United States only Where highway driving is so common therefore drivers dont really need to be educated to drive safely Within My main rules to drive in the highway are keep proper distance drive up to speed limit or slower in the right lanes and speed up or overpass on the left lanes,neutral
This annoys me so much Im driving 130kmh on the fast lane and there will always be an idiot driving slow even after flashing them,neutral

I see that commentators here are shocked that this isnt common knowledge among American drivers Let me tell you how bad it is especially in Virginia Here to get a drivers license all you need to know is how to start the car and where the gas and brake pedals are The US needs to pass laws supporting much higher quality driver education mandatory training In Japan the process is rigorous and the expectations for motorists is that they are Professional drivers That is what we need Professional drivers because US citizens spend way too much time on the roads to justify the reckless stupid driving that is the rule not the exception,neutral
If somebody is tailgating you you should move over Especially if theres a ton of cars piling up behind you,neutral
Yeah I hog the left lane Fight me I will also speed up and block you if you try to pass me lmao,positive
I dont intent to slow traffic in the left lane because I also want to go faster however some cars have more HP than others and that can trick the speed limit,neutral

If you think you are within your rights to sit in the left lane because you are doing the speed limit you are WRONG It is NOT your responsibility to enforce the speed limit only to drive SAFELY to your destination If you are blocking the left lane because you think you are being a hero YOU are breaking the law and are part of the problem,neutral
I been trying to tell people this for years Thank you for the video hope you dont mind but I posted it to Facebook,neutral
Amen  Keep to the right,positive
Ok but can they really be mad that tie hanging in the left lane going 30 over,neutral
I cant help but note deviation from average speed Quality bit of data interpretation there where the dumbed down for quick political gain would be speed kills Now on that point even keeping to the rightleft dependent on country has a drawback being slower drivers who are not consistently slow Youre in a commercial motor on a speed limiter someone in the incorrectly titled slow lane is going slower than you So you pull out to overtake the driver then speeds up and you cannot get past That has caused all sorts of issues in my many years of driving usually as they merely match your speed when you were doing 10mph more comfortably This leaves the issue of sitting there vs slowing down and trying to drop in behind them And often slowing down is not a choice because of a stack of vehicles behind you or no space behind the suddenly accelerating car because of other cars The result is a queue and the blame gets levied on the poor sod in a commercial motor,neutral

Wait hang on a minuteyou can pass on the right in some parts of the US German drivers arent just more likely to use the left for overtaking only because of the lack of a speed limit but also because passing on the right is AGAINST THE LAW EVERYWHERE IN EUROPE and is enforced Even when there are no cops you can expect to be honked at incessantly by justifiably angry drivers until you leave the left lane if youre slow,neutral
Thats like drivers 101 in Germany,neutral
This I drive nearly 400 miles 800 roundtrip to visit family twice a year and these slow leftlane drivers make me feel like Im going to have a stroke If the speed limit is 75mph why are you going 60 IN THE LEFT LANE If you are being passed by cars in the right lane be cool and switch lanes,neutral

In Germany and generally in Europe you must go through a very extensive driving school before you can actually get a driver license People over there actually know how to drive share the road understand speed differences for each lane how to change lanes how to give enough room entering or exiting the high way etc While in the US driver licenses are being handed out to people who barely know how to steer a steering wheel and shift to D,neutral

Dont Americans have to do a drivers license anymote nowadays,neutral
So its official you have to speed in order to drive correctly Why even have speed limits if youre going to get in trouble either way People dont drive the speed limit regardless of the lane theyre in and now this says Whatever the societallyaccepted speed is in this area go faster in the left lane Also this feels like were enabling people to drive like maniacs impatient people whipping and weaving through traffic instead of just driving normally That guy in the example went out of his way to pass those two underestimated the gap and took out two people But then these guys say its the other guys faults for seemingly making him drive that way as if he had no other option I get that the left lane is only the passing lane but why is it also the speeding lane Im not trying to rant here but it gets pretty frustrating when youre trying to adhere to the speed limit and then no one on the road likes you but then you maintain the flow of traffic and now cops stop you because youre technically speeding according to the posted speed limit,neutral

I have never driven a car myself but when Im in a car with my parents or something I just think its logical to drive faster in the left lane and slower in the right lane,neutral
Easy solution Make it illegal to stay in the outside lane if youre not overtaking Thats the law in a lot of European countries and faced with the prospect of200ish fines most people will just go back to the inside lane as soon as possible Oh and while youre at it also make undertaking illegal because having that be allowed is just mental,neutral

The California Driver Handbook says the following If you choose to drive slower than other traffic do not drive in the Number 1 Lane When another driver is close behind you and wishes to drive faster you should move to the right Sure we all want to obey the speed limit But what would you do when all lanes are blocked by sidebyside traffic driving 5 mph below speed limit And what would you do when only number 1 lane is available while others are blocked by traffic 1 mph above speed limit Think the number 1 lane as the express lane in the grocery store the cashier will still take you if you have more items but standing in the express lane But we will want to keep the express lane available for the people in need and qualified Same thing for driving on the road we can make the traffic smoother by doing better than the law requires,neutral
Does it apply for motorcycle ,neutral
Just like in escalators today Walk on the left stand on the right,neutral
This video is meaningless for those of us in the UK,negative

Also in Germany on the Autobahn its iirc totally forbidden to pass others from the right unless totally unavailable like in a traffic jam,neutral
This happens in El Salvador,neutral
Ah so reckless drivers are more likely to cause an accident So does that mean you cant be done for speeding in the left lane if no one else is on the road or if everyone is speeding,neutral
I was so confused until I realised the US drive the other way,negative
We dont have this problem in Portugal its like one of the first things they teach us in driving school,neutral

On Texas highways we have signs all down the highways telling everyone to get out of the left lane,neutral
The left lane is for passing and moving over for cars to get onto the highway from a ramp That is it,neutral
Because the right lane is for overtaking and youre all driving on the wrong side of the bloody road D,negative
If you have a license you should know this,neutral
People drive 5 below on highways I drive about 2025 above and stay in the middle or left lane so I can keep that speed,neutral
I had a hard time believing that there were 2700 people giving the video a Thumbs Down to sensible advice But these are likely the idiots who camp in the Left lane,neutral
You have to drive right in Germany,positive
The problem is that you dont have adequate training before being let loose on the roads You are allowed to drive at age 16 We have something called L17 in Austria allowing you to drive at age 17 Here is the process involded in attaining your license for you compare You can start at age 15 and a half 32 hours of theoretical education then write a test 30 fail Complete a 6 hour first aid course If you pass both you will have 12 hours of driving with an instructor Then you have to drive 3000km 1850miles with one of your parents as your passenger after every 1000km you have to drive with an instructor again and talk about your progress and what you have to improve upon After you did your 3000km you have another 6 hours of theory and another 3 hours of driving with an instructor The day you turn 17 you can take your driving test consisting of questions on your knowledge of a car checking fluids brakes tires serpentine belt and so on as well as function of all the buttons inside the car Plus the meaning and how to react to warning lights or other mechanical issues Parking and a small parcour and then your drive out on the road All in all this takes about an hour Another 20 fail 24 months after getting your license you have 2 sessions per 50 minutes of driving with an instuctor and talking about your driving skills and where to improve further 39 months after getting your license you have a road safety training where you will learn to control your vehicle in extreme situations emergency stops swerving to avoid obstacles reaction training low friction surface braking oversteer and understeer plus a group discussion with a road safety psychologist Takes about 89 hours 612 months after getting your license you have another 2x 50 min with an instructor same as before That was the last thing to complete now you have 3 years of probation from the moment you got your license not the second stage with a strict zero tolerance on alcohol and harder punishments that can lead to you losing your license,neutral
This should be mandatory viewing every month,neutral
Pretty common thing in West Europe even by law in some countries,neutral
Yes At a family gettogether my sister mentioned she had gotten a ticket for driving in the left lane on the freeway She voiced her opinion that she thought it was unfair since she was going the speed limit I knew the law about left lane for passing but my response was part amazement and part joy because someone actually got caught and got a ticket And I told her YAY Sorry sis but drivers hogging the fast lane drive me crazy I am glad you got a ticket,neutral
My problem with this is if the speed limit is 70 and everybody is going 85 I do not want to speed so what do I go as fast as the traffic or the speed limit,neutral
The fact that people need to be told this is worrying,neutral

Main frankly employment blow liability unable describe fifteen root general commander inside,neutral
Yesit is the rule that you should stick to the rightthe left lane is for faster driving vehicles and for passing BUT here is the problem There always is going to be someone else driving faster than you You might be driving slightly faster than the rest of traffic so you might think its OK to be in the left lane to pass other cars So you get over to the left and instantly here comes someone rushing up on your bumper No matter how fast you are going you are always going to have someone thinking its a car race and try to pass you If the speed limit is 50 and you are doing 60 you will have a string of jerks who want to do 70 If you speed up to 70 you will have people wanting to do 80 and so on It never ends It is like a chain reaction No matter how fast you speed up it makes everyone else want to go faster than you If you get over to the left to pass another car it makes everyone else in back of you do the same If someone is in the right lane going very slow when you pass them the cars in back of you are going to do the same plus attempt to pass you as well even though you were not the problem They will not simply pass the first car they will stay over to the left and floor it attempting to pass every car in sight even though those cars are already speeding,neutral
Isnt it your overtaking lane Thats how it works,neutral
Im a very fast driver I will pass you on the emergency lane if I have to,positive
Yay for Joey Move it or lose it,neutral
Isnt this taught when you learn to drive I know in UK it is And in most countrys its law aswell,positive
I always drive in the left lane but encounter no problem It is because cars in my place drive in left not right,neutral
Thank you for this video,neutral
Even if it IS law in NY I would typically encounter a slow driver in the left lane whether it was on city roads or the thruway Since moving to NH it has improved and makes a big difference in the flow of traffic but from time to time it still happens,neutral
In Australian its stay left unless over taking My mind was going haywire trying to decode this video lol,positive
they need to enforce this in California where you are constantly having to keep any eye on all the cars that weave in and out of lanes BECAUSE they are trying to pass all of those slow drivers in the left lane Its needlessly stressful because slow folks insist on staying in the left lane,neutral
The left lane is for slower car Make it right,neutral
Left is fast and slow is right is how you drive in Florida well besides braking in front of people at the last second,neutral
This is interesting an all but I cant drive yet Cya,positive
the rules are opposite in places like New Zealand if you want to overtake somebody you go on the right lane,neutral
The reason Germany can have the Autobahn is because its 10x harder to get a license over there The driving tests here in the states are a joke compared to some European countries Our whole process takes as little as six months whereas countries like Germany and Finland take anywhere from 12 years and its a lot more expensive 1000 Their fail rates are actually a lot lower than US but a lot less people taking the test per capita,neutral
Plot twist when youre on the highway everyones driving fast legally 70 is top speed fastness Of course driving 65 on the left is rude dumb and i can see how it can deserve recourse legally but to say a person going 7075 is slow and dangerous only makes an excuse for those overtly aggressive drivers theyre the ones that make roads dangerous,neutral
Exactly Get the  out of the way,neutral
PLEASE show this to everyone in Georgia,neutral
I experienced the first hand experience of using left lane only for Lane change and in my one drive on motorwayhighway in Poland I saw two accidents and i could really witness potential accident scenarios multiple times The issue here is if people use left lane only to pass we are not sure when a particular person going to come into left lane and its leading to multiple lane changes I can see people going back and forth into left lane and right lane which is really dangerous I prefer US style of driving using left lane for fast traffic and as we move away from divider the speed reduces gradually Keeping left lane only to pass is too dangerous,neutral
So lets condone illegal activity to let people drive above the limit,negative
I hate when cars in multiple lanes are driving at the same speed thus preventing passing,negative
In Germany you are not only supposed to drive right except to pass youre also not allowed to pass on the right side The combination makes it safe Also we are not driving like 120mph all the time When I visit my parents some 162 miles away I average a speed of 83mph door to door with a bit of driving through the city at the start and the end,neutral
What I do if I see a left lane hogger is keep my left indicator on so I can let them know I want to pass and then some move over and some dont PS STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE EXCEPT WHEN OVERTAKING this message is for all the Americans that dont know the rules of the road And dont even get me started on how Americans dont know how to use roundabouts,neutral
Let me explain why the German Autobahn works without speed limits and accident rates are low The Autobahn is generally maintained very well in the first place second on those stretches that actually are without speed limits drivers do not only tend to keep right unless they are passing but they also drive extremely cautiously when they pass This is due to the fact that you dont want to get rearended by someone driving 160mph in the left lane while you switch into it with 80mph So not only does the lack of a speed limit tend to get drivers to keep right it also forces them to switch lanes extremely cautiously opposed to what can be observed in many other countries This means that the drivers have to stay focused similarily to a situation in which you try to find way in a big unknown city,neutral
I was about to sayEurope has been doing this thing for a very long time but as always america is a decade behind,neutral
If you have relatively slow drivers on the left and right drivers have to swerve to pass you maybe just dont try and go that fast You dont swerve you dont cause an accident,neutral
I cant believe the guy is so surprised this is obvious and standard anywhere in Europe,neutral
Keep right unless to pass isnt universal This is news,neutral
Common sense presented by vox,negative
Im surprised this isnt taught in US driving schools In Europe this is pretty much the norm and if you go slow you will get tailgated until you understand you should move over,neutral
Dear Ohioans please watch this 5 times in a row and GTFO the left lane Sincerely your Kentucky neighbor,neutral
Personally I dont drive in the far left lane so I dont get hit by oncoming traffic,neutral
Isnt this common sense In Germany we have the Rechtsfahrgebot It means Drive on the freaking right lane if there is room to do so ,neutral
In Europe left lanes are reserved for overtaking its unlikely but you should be fined if you stay in left lanes,neutral

I leaned about the face paint thing on the actors at school It was a part of Jim Crow of course Jim Crow went on for many years dating back to almost the 17th century and ending around the 60s Whites used to stereotype and rumor that African Americans were mischievous and that they were savages This led to the whites making movies merchandise and tv shows trashing the reputations of all African Americans That is why the faces are painted The things white Americans did back then were such despicable actions,neutral
So it all started with racism like America wich is still racist ok,positive
Birds dont wear gloves cause their arms are actually wings and their fingers are actually feathers it would be hard to fly with gloves on your wings,neutral

Hands ARE hand to draw But using gloves just change the color of there hand its still hands,neutral
easy so they dont leave fingerprints on the murder scene,positive
Possible practical reason gloves help keep their fur away from everything including their food  Possible animation reason it allows the viewer to see what the hands are doing especially if a character has a complexion dark enough to unwillingly hide the individual fingers Also 4 fingers are much easier to animate than 5 fingers and doesnt take away from what the hands are doing,neutral

Unfortunately the US has grown into one of the biggest arms dealers on the planet and their economy is interlinked with and dependent on a military industrial complex It could have been predicted that their arms technology could later be used against them Feudal cultures that were based on hand combat using swords suddenly found themselves being trained by the CIA to use weapons with much more power Couple that with a society that worships the martyr living in a comparatively hopeless situation and you have a recipe for escalating violence that is very hard to contain It is not easy to stop that kind of cycle but an ethical way to start would be to reduce the US dependency on the sale of weapons to other countries,neutral

I really hope somebody caught that ball and there isnt a huge divot in that lane,positive
Before you think this is a way of rigging the game its not for the average Saturday afternoon bowler The oil patter then typically use for open bowling is such that it will guide the ball toward the center or the strike zone so bowlers dont get frustrated and get better scores For semiserious bowlers like league bowlers they are well aware of the patterns and can either adjust to the conditions or change to a hardersofter ball Its part of the game There are also many different patterns that give different results Something else to consider a freshly conditioned lane is ideal for a serious bowler Its predictable Since the oil only goes down about 3545 feet you get that distinct hook at the last moment the latter part of the lane is dry the ball spin grabs and the ball hooks Now after several games on a lane the oil gets carried all the way down to the pins so you have to either move a board or two over or switch balls Anyway without oil bowling would be boring and predictable,neutral

Youll likely never experience the ideal condition of these oil patterns if you dont bowl in a league or tournament If you bowl in a league youll likely experience it on the 2nd to last night of the season when the league teams are bowling for final placement in the standings The last night of the season is sweeps and award ceremony based on the league ending stats from the week before And youll experience it bowling in a tournament So how do you use this knowledge In a league or tournament use the practice period to see how your ball is responding to the oil condition of the lane If you need to adjust you can move so youre putting your ball down on a different board and you can aim at a different arrow or board I suppose you can also adjust the amount of spin you add to the ball I threw a straight ball and never purposely tried to adjust the spin on my ball,neutral
I have always done this making my ball go on the side of the middle of the lane and I would always get a strike I never knew this was the reason why I just did it because I saw it worked in Wii Sports,neutral

This video was about oil but one important piece not mentioned is the actual ball itself There is a weight inside the ball A house ball will have the weight in the very center This is to help amateurs keep it straight in the middle of the lane Bowlers who use their own ball have the finger holes drilled in a certain spot so that the weight is off center In the video he talks about the ball hooking back to the pocket once it passes the oil This is helped by that off center weight inside the ball There is definitely a certain wrist action in throwing a curve ball but the majority of the movement to that sweet spot in the pocket is done by the offset weight bringing it there You just have to make sure you have thrown the ball so that weight reacts at the right time,neutral

People seem to be misunderstanding the concept of being a part of a simulated universe You arent a player character no one is controlling you You are a nonplayable character AKA an NPC A good way to think about it is imagine NPCs in video games Now imagine an NPC so advanced that it has consciousness artificial intelligence and an entire life within the confines of the game Thats what you are There doesnt necessarily have to be anyone actually PLAYING either A simulation can be run for a variety of purposes only a few of which require actually jumping in and taking part in the simulation,neutral

The point of exercise is to replace fat with muscle not just lose weight,neutral
In summary it is not feasible to outwork a bad diet,negative
This video is kind of biased It talks about cardiovascular exercises like Jogging and Cycling What they do is burn calories directly But what they missed out was looking at High Intensity exercises like Sprinting and Lifting weights Lifting weights builds muscle mass in your body And this in turn increases the work your body has to put into utilizing the muscles and thus increases your Resting Metabolism which happens to also be the number 1 factor in affecting the calories you burn Not to discredit the video but they were absolutely right in saying that diet ultimately is the main issue but they shouldnt say that exercising is ineffective,neutral
Youll definitely look better if you workout to lose weight vs just dieting lol,positive

Exercise is useless when it comes to weight loss  And I immediately unliked the video,negative
Dont join on Jan 1 it is way to crowded On Jan 14 the new members are gone and it is back to the regulars I dont know about other people but exercising does seem to make me lose weight I even eat better I crave sugar less I think I look at sugary foods and associate the calories with how long I would have to work to burn them off So I think twice I do agree that we should work towards collective solutions like making our food healthier But I definitely dont think they should be discouraging people from exercising Without movement our bodies die much more quickly,neutral
Ive lost 20 pounds in 18 days by limiting my calories to 1200 a day and working out twice a day I feel pretty good about myself and I feel like working out everyday contributes more than anything,positive
This sounds pretty defeating Ill just stay on the couch and eat less,neutral
The secret Workout Eat well Sleep well Spend sometime with your family Be happy You will be better and lose fats whilst having a good life,positive
Exercise in this video talk is about only burning calories by running or cycling They dont mention lifting weights To increase the bar for resting metabolism lift heavy weights to gain muscle When you increase the size of your muscles you can increase your intake of food because you need more calories to maintain your muscles With that you are able to burn more calories even when you are resting referring to resting metabolism,positive
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ONLY ACCOUNTS 10 TO 30 IN ENERGY USE MAN 30 IS A LOT,neutral
i hope people get that the point of the video is not to stop exercising altogether but that exercise alone is not enough and maintaining a healthy diet is also necessary,neutral
I literally had no exercise at all Everyday go to work and walk Just normal work routine 45L water a day 24hours I eat low carb and high fat I eat less than 1600 calories a day I have lost 14KG in the pas 3 months From 90KG to 76KG And i still keep going until reach my ideal weight which is 65KG Wish me luck,neutral
Just Stop Eating And you dont have to pushup situp squat whatever,neutral
Its around 80 percent diet Starvation or caloric deprivation causes weight loss,neutral
Come on the vast majority of Americans need to change their diet for the better and you all know it to be true You really can basically undo your hour long run on the treadmill with one slice of pizza Its literally that simple We have to eat better people theres no getting around it And of course the top ten percent of people that are ALREADY athletic and in good health will talk about how they are outliers and how much of an exception they are,positive
I am studying as an undergraduate about to finish my degree in exercise Physiology at Kennesaw State University This video though mostly true leaves out some very important details Exercise is extremely important to overall health and eating is extremely important for weight control However the research done here is interpreted in a way that downplays the effects ofexercise on weight The effects of exercise go far beyond the acuteie the right there and theneffects of a single workout Exercise will burn a small amount of calories during a workout but the small amounts of damage and trauma done to the body during a regular bout of exercise need time and energy to repair Your body has to recover and repair itself after every workout This can almost double the energy expended in the workout sometimes Resistance training is a great example You burn very few calories lifting weights but as the body rebuilds itself and prepares for the next bout it uses so much more energy throughout the rest of the day even into the next day that the effects are magnified Not only is this working in your advantage but also when new muscle tissue is created itbegins demanding nutrients regularly and adds to your Basal Metabolic Rate or the amount of energy you require just to maintain your current body weight So you burn more fat in your sleep Even though the effects may not be as blatantly obvious for weight loss as slowlystarving yourself until you reach a goal weight exercise plays a huge and irreplaceable role in weight management,neutral
The reduction in resting metabolism is actually true I sleep much less when exercising everyday But on days when i dont workout i sleep much longer and better,neutral
Losing 5 pounds a month  That sounds pretty good Thats how much you should aim to lose,positive
How to increases RMR exercise specifically weight lifting,neutral
No killer workout can replace caloric restriction and saying goodbye to sugar junk carbs transfats soda fast food junk food convenience food Harvard University and numerous other scientific research organizations proved that aerobic and anerobic exercise did little to lower body fat However instead of sitting on ones ass watching a screen of any kind take up ordinary movement Walking housework cutting grass parking at the far end away from the store and walking are the only exercise a person eating a restricted calorie diet actually needs,neutral
Mental health benefits are the best thing about exercise IMO,positive
This video confirmed what my doctor told me a few years ago What u eat is way more important than working out at the gym,positive
active workout also improves metabolismwhich lead to weight loss,neutral
I agree i changed my diet just 3 days in lost 5lbs and i have also gained weight training very hard cardio and weight training but obviously taking in way to many calories But if you wanna be muscular and hard looking u gotta train or be skinny and flabby like jarred from Subway,neutral
For people confused Of coarse exercise isnt going to work if you lose say 200 calories then go to a fastfood place and gain 800 calories,neutral
Eat less move more lose weight Pretty simple,neutral
Working out is also therapeutic When you sweat and go out of breath your body releases hormones that actually make you feel happier and feel better,neutral
To lose weight you cant just do exercise you have to combine it with a good diet and running burns more calories than taking the stairs,positive
so amI mistaken or did this study just totally ignore muscle mass and its effects on resting metabolism,neutral
i totally flipped out I thought I lost my phone at gym I think I am to stressed,neutral
Exercise does help you lose weight but you can not out exercise a bad diet Not going to happen,negative

Agree with the vid but the best thing about exercise is that it motivates you to eat healthier plus it improves mental health,positive
This video does not even reference the fact that one type of exercise resistance training can build enough muscle to significantly increase your BMR,neutral
Exercise maintain and build muscle in the body The more muscle means more mitochondria mitochondria burns fat But muscle has massweight so it doesnt show to much progress in the scale Its effective to make yourself look good in the mirror but not to look good in the scale Simple and thats that,positive
Despite knowing this to be true I continue to workout like a horse but still eat and look like a pig Nice,positive
the people that are selling crack are telling their customers to go to the gym,neutral
The video isnt saying not to exercise Its saying that based on whatever studies they cite those studies found that exercising alone does not necessarily lead to results It is true that losing weight is as simple as calories in  calories out and exercising increases calories out however human behaviour takes a toll People tend to justify eating more or eating worse because they exercised In this case while theyre increasing calories out theyre also increasing calories in Theyre not saying its impossible to lose weight by just exercising only that its a lot harder and requires a lot more focus and self control than most people have Changing the way we eat and our approach to food is in the opinion of the studies this video cites a more sustainable and effective way to lose weight At the end of the day everyone needs to find what works for them,neutral
Doesnt more muscle mass increases your metabolism,positive

healthy eating is the most important tip then exercise is for having strong healthy body,positive
MISLEADING VIDEO This is is talking about aerobic exercise because anaerobic exercise leads to muscle gain If you have a larger muscle mass then you have a greater resting metabolism So you can lose fat if you gain some muscle,neutral
WHYYY ITS SOOO MUCH MORE EASY TOdo exercise then diet,positive
building muscle increases your metabolic rate,neutral
They never say that exercise wont help you lose weight They say that exercise is harder to lose weight If you workout a lot but eat a lot of junk food Then you will have hard time losing weight We all know that exercise is good for you but for losing weight it is not the only option Remember that diet is also very important,neutral
exercise makes me more full If I was hungry at first after a 30 min light cardio Im super full,positive
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT a minute Im a fitness instructor and all my fancy textbooksteacherspersonal experience show that the more muscle you have the higher your resting metabolism And how do you gain more muscle You workout So YES exercise helps you lose weight just not quite the way we thought Seriously I lost 30lbs through cardio I promise it works,neutral
Weight lifting is a form of exercise If you develop more lean muscle tissue it increases your resting metabolism to sustain muscle Which they stated is the most effective consumption of daily energy needs ,positive
Pointless video Losing weight depends on the balance between incoming energy and burning energy If we assume that an average person burns aprox 1800 caloriesday that person needs to consume less calories than this ammount in order to lose weight Each calorie corresponds to a quantity of body weight We can lose weight either by increasing our calories burning rythm which can be done most effectivelly by excersise and by decreasing our food consumption in terms of calories intake Of course if we increase both intake and burning by the same ammount the balance doesnt change but it is ridigelous to blame excersise about it The most efficient way to lose weight is to excersise a bit to increase the daily calorie burn by excersise and to decrease the energy consumption simultaneously Excersise alongside a proper diet works better because the weight loss is undoubtedly faster and healthier maintaining or even increasing muscle mass and lossing only fat in comparison with diet alone,neutral
As some others have said mostly true Simply put weight loss is about expending more energy than what is consumed Doesnt matter whether thats eating less or exercising more That said metabolic function has been grossly simplified in the video While it is true that the body can and will adapt to exercise it takes awhile for this to happen This is why resistance training requires changing things up changing acute variables such as volume resistance tempo etc But the body also adjusts to eating less It will also cause your Basal Metabolic Rate to go down And for that reason this video gets it majorly wrong If you lose weight through food onlyprimarily the metabolic adaptations will be worse than theyd be if you did so onlyprimarily via exercise especially resistance training At some point your body will start burning lean muscle and that will be problematic because lean muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain and thus your BMR will go down The reality is that the better way to lose weight is to eat less eat a better variety of nutrientdense foods and exerciseespecially resistance training But what do I know I only lost 150 lbs,neutral
So combining good nutrition with exercise is key What is new,positive
You can increase your resting metabolism by adding muscle mass Bad science,negative
I was under the impression that more muscle mass means a higher amount of calories needed at rest And I took one anatomyphysiology class in college yo,positive

Cardio is not optimal for weight loss but resistance training will increase your metabolism so on the long term it is the best solution to keep excess fat off your bodyalso the thermogenic effect is so minimal its not even something people should look at and its the same if you have one big 2500kcal meal or five 500kcal meals,neutral
in short we are what we eat  simple o,neutral

Claiming to have read 60 studys is not evidence Stating that exercise comprises a tiny fraction of daily energy burn and going on to say the number is 10 to 30 Thats not tiny its significant Guess what if you work out for 90 minutes a day the number becomes very significant A man running an hour a day looses 5 pounds in a week Thats a lot What if you did this for ten weeks The touted expert who probably wrote the studies she references in the titles telling you how time consuming weight loss by exercise is and how quickly you can erase your workout The average canadian watches 30 hour of television a week What do you think would happen if they took ten of the thirty and added it to their weekly exercise Theyd lose weight significant weight Yes diet is equally important you must align the two but I categorically reject the premise of this presentation Julia Belluz you need to check your own biases Your compiling evidence to support ideas you already identify with,neutral

Just to summarize this for everyone If you exercise youll still reduce your weight even with the same diet as you have but it will take longer If you change your diet to healtier foods youll lose weight as well depending on how bad your diet was you can lose a lot of weight or very little Combining exercise and changes in your diet are the key to weight lose and overall a healthier lifestyle I myself lost about 15 pounds in a couple of months because I cut out soda and fast food which I used to eat everyday and then procided to gain back 10 pounds over the next 4 months because Ive been exercisinglifting as well Everything I saw in this video I already knew because I like to be well informed on subjects that interest me I would like to point out that if you are interested in working out consider supplements like beta alanine and creatine together because they help with muscle growth and that will increase your resting metabolism alonf with helping you lose weight Also I just want to point out choose a healthy diet that will promote healthy weight loss and not a crazy crash diet where you will lose weight crazy fast by say eating only 600800 calories a day and drinking tons of water because those diets dont work and once you get off them youll inevitable gain back the weight,neutral

This video obscures two crucial points about health and exercise 1 Your basal metabolic rate is under your control and anaerobic exercise is how you control it This video talks about exercise as if aerobic exercise were the only kind that counted Anaerobic exercise eg weight lifting rock climbing etc will add muscle which will raise your resting calorie consumption 2 Weight is not the primary health risk Body fat percentage is the primary health risk Weight is easier and more satisfying to measure But the fast ways of losing weight all cause muscle loss which will sabotage your basal metabolic rate See point 1,positive
They need to distinguish between aerobic exercise and anerobic hypertrophyinducing exercise The former will consume sugar and fat stores The latter will consume sugar and fat stores but also raise your bmr increasing base level burned,negative

Obvious statement is obvious but sure for *purely* losing weight exercise isnt the best way as a standalone option You exercise you gain muscle weight you burn fat less weight than muscle Thing is the better physical shape you get in the more efficient your body becomes at burning stored fat and retaining or building muscle which provides physical and mental health benefits as well as a reduction in visceral fat which is more important than simply focusing on losing weight Only exercise as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your diet as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your sleeping habits isnt best If you have excessive body fat the best solution to eliminate that excessive fat is to combine proper exercise with proper healthy foods with proper sleeping patterns Human physiology isnt meant to handle sitting at a desk for 8 hours then sitting in a car for an hour then sitting on the sofa at home watching TV for the rest of the evening while drinking sugary garbage,positive

Are you confused about what is going on in the Middle East Allow me to explain from a USUK perspective We The West support the Iraqi government in their fight against ISIS We dont like ISIS but ISIS is supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar whom we do like because we love our oil nice and cheap The Iraqi government is getting help from Iran to fight ISIS but we dont like Iran because they dont like listening to us Now coming to Syria We dont like Syrian President Bashar Al Assad whos a big baddie because he is friends with other big baddies like Russia and Iran So we support the fight against Assad by arming training and funding moderate rebels because overthrowing Assad means we can put a goodie ie someone who will listen to us in his place So we do not cooperate with the baddies Assad Iran and Russia who btw are also at war with ISIS to collectively defeat ISIS even though defeating ISIS is supposedly our number one priority in ME because the baddies are also attacking our moderate rebels without whom our regime change plan would fail So some of our friends are supporting some of our enemies and some of our enemies are kind of like our friends cos theyre fighting against our other enemies whom we want to lose but we also dont want our enemies who are fighting our other enemies to win because theyre also our enemies So right now we dont know which one of our enemies we want for to win and which one of them we want for to loseand while we make up our minds the war rages on for which all parties need more and more weapons to continue waging and since we are the biggest weapons exporter in the world more warmore money so I guess perpetual warfare is just what the doctor ordered And lets not forget this whole mess started in the first place by our ILLEGALLY invading a country in search of WMDs that NEVER existed to drive out terrorists who only cropped up AFTER we went in to drive them out Do you understand now,neutral

This was a great video Id just like to also add that it isnt necessarily true that movie creators back in the day didnt know that theyre doing uncanny material but I personally feel like there was this huge ideal in the 19902000s that followed the more realistic the better We were breaking through computational power that pushed the boundaries that was supposed to blur the lines between realism and the fake and I think everything there followed suit we had this idea that now everything could become real instead of pretend everything that we simulated like legos dolls actionfigures all of it could now become as real as we always dreamed they would be But then I think we kind of sobered up when we saw the result Fully realistic ISNT always better It also kind of highlighted that we all add so different things to our play We all said yeah wouldnt it be awesome if this toy was real but then when we see a full 3Danimated version on the screen that follows one persons idea of what that means 999 other people disagree Because thats what we do we fill in the gaps of what we expect there to be but what these gaps are filled with can vary I think it is related to Gestalt Psychology where you can see a triangle that is full of gaps and still recognize it as a triangle the same way we can find highcontrasting imagery of people with few details to be more beautiful because we fill in the gap of what we imagine to be beautiful where these details are gone So I think now in this day and age we have two paths One that is still going ultrarealistic and one that is just trying to see the charm in the things as they are Like the lego movie but also indiegames that are satisfied with not having topnotch graphics but just enough,positive

525 this is such a great casestudy for how derivative works ought to be treated under copyrighttrademark law A fan makes a derivative work and Lego has the ability to shut it down Meanwhile Lego makes a work thats highly derivative of what those very fans make and everythings fine and people even seem to think wow its so cool that they made shoutouts to all the fans in the form of deriving or even using verbatim their art Anyway it sounds like Lego came around pretty quickly But not every company does and maybe the law ought to be structured so that both individuals and companies are always treated equally when it comes to derivatives by code,neutral

EXPLANATIONS What are some of the international law mistakes in this video longexplanation Hello everyone First of all I would like to say that Vox always do a wonderful job at describing a geopolitical conflict unfortunately in this video there are many international law mistakes Im a French Canadian Law School student currently studying international law and Im writing this message because many people asked me to explain what are these mistakes next week I have 5 midterms so I wont have time to explain in details everything that is wrong in this video but I will point out a few of them very very quick Mistake number 1 at 200 Vox says that But any area that isnt in the EEZ 200 miles of the shore is regarded as international waters it means everybody shares it This is misleading because its not 100 right Some countries have a continental shelf art 76 of the The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS Basically what it means is that some countries have rights in an area that exceed 200 miles but shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured And in these 350 nautical miles art 77 UNCLOS Rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources So saying that everyone can share the resources that isnt in the 200 miles is not true all of the time Mistake number 2 lets talk about the Spratly Islands at 310 Vox says that any countries that can claim the Spratly Islands can extend their EEZ to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territories This is FALSE To understand why lets take a look at art 121 UNCLOS An island is a naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf And now in the case law The republic of the Philippines v the peoples republic of China it clearly states at paragraph 622 that  The Tribunal having concluded that none of the hightide features in the Spratly Islands is capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own the effect of Article 1213 is that such features shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf The Tribunal concluded that this provision depends upon the objective capacity of a feature in its natural condition to sustain either a stable community of people or economic activity that is not dependent on outside resources or purely extractive in nature The Tribunal noted that the current presence of official personnel on many of the features is dependent on outside support and not reflective of the capacity of the features There are many more mistakes in this video but honestly its almost 1AM and Im tired AF But Id like to point out that maybe the US does not intervene in the LEGAL conflict between The Philippines and China because the US never signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seanot because it wants to evoid WW3 English is my second language dont hate Goodnight everyone hope you liked my reply,neutral

The US has never ratified the UN laws of the sea Congress refused to ratify it because they claimed that would give too much power to the United Nations and lead towards a world government over American sovereignty Furthermore the US also has its own Munroe doctrine across the all Western Hemisphere The reason why China is building Islands in that area is to protect its sea lanes and keep Western influence and incursion from there Remember that in the early 20th and 19th century European and Western powers looted pillaged and invaded many countries in that region including China and they used those sea lanes to unleash havoc upon much of Asia 23 of all the trade going through those waters go to through or from China China is the largest or second largest trading partner for almost all the Countries in that region Why would they want to blockade their own ports,neutral

As a third party personIm from East Asia I can understand Israels motivation here though I wont say I agree with it Israel does not have any actual ally near its borderline while Palestine and Arab countries still do not give a sign of trust that theyll stop trying to wipe out Israel when situations change in the future like what they did in year 1948 Yes the way Israel treats its Palestinian counterpart is definitely wrong in detail But in the big picture it is impossible to set your weapons down if it seems clear that your enemies will not allow your very existence as soon as it becomes a practical option The colonial empires  in this case the UK  are the only evil side in this problem And I think the key to the problem is mutual trust among Israel Palestine and surrounding Arabic countries,neutral

Another AntiIsraeli video First some numbers 1 Palestine before 1948 was a general name which included the land of Jordan saying that just for historical correction 2 You claimed in the video that the descendants of the 1948 war consist of 7 million in numbers While you show in the picture that the numbers of refugee in this war is less then 750000 How could they be 7 million if 70 years ago they were 750 thousands 3 The PLO was founded in 1916 Not sure if I heard you correctly Because the PLO was founded in 1964 and even then it didnt see itself as a national movement 4 People should talk about the fact that there were some how talked about Palestine independent country the majority of them saw themselves as part of the big Arab country vision and wanted to be annexed either by Egypt or Syria see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiIndependence_Party_Mandatory_PalestineThe PLO was established with the same notion The real nationalism of the Palestinians came to greater extends in the 70s and the 80s 5 You really diminished the effect of the Oslo Accords in which Israel gave the Palestinians 95 of their inhabited territories in the West Bank and yet Israeli saw how the violence only grew afterwards So saying that most israelis kind of lost hope in the peace process you need to better explain why Until today Benjamin Netanyahu asks from the Palestinian leaders to recognize the right of israel to exist as a jewish state withing the 67 border and they still refuse to do so,neutral

Well made video no doubt but it was wrong about something important When the Arab armies invaded Israel upon Independence they did not wish to create a Unified Palestinian state they wanted to grab it to themselves This is important because hiding this fact can give an impression Palestinians are more separate from other Arabs then they really are In reality this separation is little different then the one between Iraq Syria and Jordan  European enforced with little more to it Another large miss is the never changing goal of the Arab armies and Palestinian militias of their Jewish question The Jewish expulsion from Arab states is also ignored which makes over 50 of Israeli Jews Ignoring this makes it easier to see Israel as colonial and the comment that extreme Israelis want to destroy the Palestinians is laughable That argument only goes the other way All this together can give the common wrong impression the conflict is more about how much land people control rather then security and acceptance of the other sides self determination Which is the larger tobesettled issue,neutral

such a shame this misleading video got so many watchers you need to be careful and persist and if you dont know all the history dont publish this kind of videos on public you genius didnt mentioned those facts 1 the land of Cnaan was promised on the bible first to the Jewish ppl who already lived there long before The Ottoman Empire concurred the land  pls do not forget that the Jewish bible is the first was written among other religions books 2 the Sykes picot and the San Remo conference where the first and the only boundaries agreements that got statutory from the UN and it was before the UN Vote on the Partition Plan on Nov 29 1947 that never came across because of the Arab nationss attack and penetration to the Israeli territory right after 3 Read the Palestinian National Covenant and Hamass covenant before you judge Israel understand that although Israel demanded to cancel the Palestinian national covenant as part of the Oslo Accords and other accords and although the Palestinians leaders promised to do so they never changed or cancel it Yaser Arafat said right after the Oslo accord to all the Palestinian ppl and all the arab ppl on radio that the Oslo agreement is just one more step to fulfill the Palestinian national covenant and destroy the Jewish country 4 the green line boundaries never got permanent statutory it was just Temporary ceasefire borders so due to the British mandate Ramat Hgolan and Yehuda Veshomron are in the rightful boundaries of Israel look at Article 80 Chapter 12 of the Charter of the United Nations 5 if Israel give more lands like Yehuda Veshomron and Ramat Hagolan it will make Israel unlovable to Arab attacks 6 the Arabs started the 6 days war 7 Israel has the most humanitarian army in the world we dont kill citizens we kill terrorists who live all their life in one purpose and one purpose only destroy Israel and Jews to become shahids you cannot trust them and the history shows it repeatedly all the time and more and more,neutral

I can understand when people say the Arabs are the ones who attack first so can pretend that Israel wants peace But let me ask you this if someone broke into your house and just sat there you could understand how they just sat there But the person whose home it is would not sit still Its completely justified for the Arabs to respond with violence Even if they lost It may not have been smart on the Arabs part and may not be smart now as the Palestinian blood shed is much worse than the Israelis but it is completely justified It makes sense It was never your land,neutral

Our new museums facility had people scratching their heads in how to enter our building We couldnt understand it either since we had double doors signs that said which door to push no handles on one of the doors etc It wasnt until watching this video two weeks ago that it dawned on us to simply remove the handle from the outside push side and simply replace it with a brass plate No one has difficulties now Duh Why not one of our designers noticed this over our first year in the new building is beyond comprehension,neutral

I was banned from a supermarket once because I fell victim to their bad design In Germany you have to return used bottles to the supermarket So I went to this supermarket with a couple of bottles and there was a sign that indicated where to return them I walked there and there was a door that said fire safety door  must not be held open So I thought oh I guess I have to open it then So I opened it and there was the machine that said ready and accepted my bottles But then an employee of the supermarket stomped at me really angrily and banned me from the store because I was not supposed to open that door It was ridiculous because there was no way to know that so I asked to talk to the owner to clear things up but he agreed that I should be banned from the store and he was like what should we do add a sign to the door As if that would be something that was unthinkable Wow it still aggravates me today,neutral
In the us most doors that are the entry and exit point for a room that has a capacity of more than 20 are to be pushed on exit and pulled on entry due to fire code There was an infamous fire in Chicago where a lot of people burned alive because the crowd mobbed the door which made it impossible to pull it open Since then this rule has been the standard I hardly ever get doors wrong no matter how poorly designed they are due to my knowledge of this so hopefully spreading the word will help some others too,neutral
There is a law in Canada every doors in public spaces have to open toward outdoor for fire safety There were a case where everybody rushed to the door and it was impossible to open the door and almost everybody died,neutral

I love the video  looks like the door at Vox though was designed as a doubleswinging door  this is pretty common for frameless glass doors as putting a push plate on one side looks really ugly from the other side Then probably postinstallation the access control card swipe guys have come along and installed a magnetic clamp locking device at the top of the doors you can see this in the video making them only able to open inwards I see this happening all the time typically due to cost  systems which support doubleswinging doors are much more expensive and less reliable at locking compared to a magnetic clamp on a door that only swings one way,neutral

OK I can finally answer Unlike the US Switzerland for example has regulation on doors the regulation being that doors MUST open towards the closest evacuation route unless the room the door leads to is for example an office with less than 20 people using said room The office door is most probably push because having a door block a hallway is annoying In the case of the initial door that feels wrong shown in the video it looks like some sort of larger room behind that door a room that can easily fit 20 people I would need confirmation on the nature of the space and I would assume that evacuation routes are via the hallway so the door is opening in the wrong direction,neutral

In Newfoundland Canada there was once a fire at a big dance the K of C fire Everybody at the fire rushed to the exit but the doors opened inwards and with the crowds of panicking people there was no room to open the doors and everyone died Ever since then doors in Newfoundland were designed to open outwards for ease of escape during an emergency and most Newfoundlanders have a sense that thats the direction to open a door,neutral

doors should always be pushing inside the room heres why 1 so that when you exit you dont have to walk two feet forward then go in the opposite direction 2 there are always more people outside the room and most of the time pushing is easier 3 so it doesnt hit somebody closely walking by the room 4 pushing inside sounds way more sexual,positive
Ive noticed pull handles on push doors everywhere in NYC Thousands like the second door they show after the Vox office doors The long handle that goes across the breadth of the door indicated I need to pull it open Nope Its that way on both sides Then youve got the businesses that have double doors and always keep the right one locked Its a damned conspiracy of dolts I tell ya,neutral

v t e American South in the War of 1812 show v t e Naval battles of the War of 1812 The War of 1812 18121815 was a conflict fought between the United States the United Kingdom and their respective allies Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars in the United States and Canada it is seen as a war in its own right Since the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France which the United States contested as illegal under international law To man the blockade Britain impressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy Incidents such as the ChesapeakeLeopard affair inflamed antiBritish sentiment In 1811 the British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in which 11 British sailors died1415 The British supplied Indians who conducted raids on American settlers on the frontier which hindered American expansion and also provoked resentment16 Historians remain divided on whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America contributed to the American decision to go to war On June 18 1812 United States President James Madison after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress signed the American declaration of war into law17 With the majority of their army in Europe fighting Napoleon the British adopted a defensive strategy American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity especially in New England where it was derogatorily referred to as Mr Madisons War American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada improving British morale American attempts to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal also failed In 1813 at the Battle of Lake Erie the Americans won control of Lake Erie and at the Battle of the Thames defeated Tecumsehs Confederacy securing a primary war goal At sea the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will In 1814 one of these raids burned the capital Washington although the Americans subsequently repulsed British attempts to invade New England and capture Baltimore At home the British faced mounting opposition to wartime taxation and demands to reopen trade with America With the abdication of Napoleon the blockade of France ended and the British ceased impressment rendering the issue of the impressment of American sailors moot The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast annihilating American maritime trade and bringing the United States government near to bankruptcy Peace negotiations began in August 1814 and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24 as neither side wanted to continue fighting News of the peace did not reach America for some time Unaware that the treaty had been signed British forces invaded Louisiana and were defeated at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 These late victories were viewed by Americans as having restored national honour leading to the collapse of antiwar sentiment and the beginning of the Era of Good Feelings a period of national unity News of the treaty arrived shortly thereafter halting military operations The treaty was unanimously ratified by the United States on February 17 1815 ending the war with status quo ante bellum no boundary changes,neutral

what about a push door with a handle for emergencies what if you need to shut the door quickly in the event of an emergency ie intruder,positive
As German the shown Door had irritated me too Because mostly in Germany all Doors are designed to or even HAVE to be designed to in certain areas open in the direction of escape  so this door would normally open to the floorside as this is the route to escape in emergency This has many reasons like preventing people getting trampled to death when a mass panic occurs and you just run away steered mostly by your instincts But mostly Doors like this open to both sides,neutral
The mall door i almost always go to has a vertical handle you would assume you pull a sign that SAYS PULL and yet you can only push it and its been like that ever since i can remember,neutral

Atleast the remake is better imo alien style plane fits so much better to this movie,neutral
Disney wasnt aiming for the truck,neutral
I disagree that it is time to stop mourning 911 Many tragedies are mourned for decades afterwards as a sign of respect and to remind us of what caused them What needs to be stopped is using 911 as incentive to send soldiers into the Middle East for whatever reason politicians say When they bring it up at rallies it is not to mourn but to garner votes The deaths started on September 11th 2001 and they carry on to this day,neutral
I remember seeing the before version in around 200506,neutral

Disregarding 911 Id still want it cut partially because thats not how planes move and even though Jumbas a genius I doubt he would know how to fly a plane better than a space ship,positive

The whole scene in the uncut version with the plane flying near the city buildings felt very uncanny No wonder why it was cut,neutral
You can afford to use the uninterrupted audio The music is unnecessary and unwanted,neutral
Not sure if this is my initail fear of planes and plane crashes talking but the original version looks ALOT more unnerving to me despite it being a cartoon I dont know of its because of how huge the plane is compared to the town or how close it is touching the ground as its zooming around but it honestly looks alot more terrifying Im glad they redid the scene,neutral
This made the suckstobeyou fate of the ice cream guy much sharper Not even in an isolated valley is his ice cream safe,positive

Not such a bad idea to change it My dad died the same year Simbas dad died and that was a coincidentally excessive amount of amplification for a tiny kid in a theater Lol now I want to know who in their right mind took me to see that film In other words theres not need to change everything but a little sympathy can go a long way when the tragedy is national and not just personal Kudos to disney,neutral
That was a klm 747 in September 2001 unreleased cut,neutral
Good thing they changed it because the worlds people would have thought Disney was responsible for 911 In fact I myself would have thought that Lilo  Stitch was soley reponsible for 911 themselves,positive

Tbh the original scene was way cooler,positive
I dont understand why we went through so many changes to eliminate scenes with planes flying close to building or images with the twin towers in them I do feel like changing the plane to a space ship makes more sense but not changing the city to a mountain area I feel like a lot of effort was made to forget what happened and I get that but in some cases I think its unnecessary to make such big changes,neutral
damn disney woke AF,neutral
Keep in mind the movie was released only 9 months after 911 People would still have vivid memories of the tragedy,neutral

Mistakes AKP didnt intend to help the religious oppressed by secularism always They became antisecular in late 2000s Before that Erdogan looked pretty liberal he even said he was pro LGBT rights The coup was not a secular coup it was staged by another religious group The Kemalist leaders of the army were purged in an investigation called Ergenekon years before the coup The army havent been Kemalists since then The Kemalists were replaced by FETO members a very large islamist group which allegedly staged the coup The referendum was rigged The electoral council started counting unofficial ballots midcount and a Turkish news agency started releasing official YesNo percentages way before the electoral council did no one really knows how they got the numbers before electoral council released them The count was live too so electoral council knew about this agency releasing its numbers and they let them There are a lot of speculations about this While it wasnt really a mistake its important to note that Ataturk was also a democratically selected dictator So its not like the Turkish people were all islamists and Ataturk tried forcing his ideas upon them And also most of his laws were democratically created in fact he only used his dictator powers in the war of independence Ban on headscarves wasnt done by Ataturk was done in the 90s and also it wasnt a total ban Only from government institutions,neutral

Main things that need to be corrected in the video according to me are 1 Ataturk had somewhat dictatorialish powers as the founder plus he had almost full support of the citizens as the war hero But he didnt want to be a dictator as he tried to bring multiparty system a few times unfortunately couldnt manage to do it before his death because in every attempt small but somewhat effective Islamist groups who hated secular change tried to abuse it caused him to postpone the plans before it becomes a major crisis Also the only thing he dictated was secularism related stuff which he thought was the only way to protect the country from repeating the later Ottoman mistakes 2 Headscarfs were only banned for public servants only during their jobs in their work place and for students Its purpose was whether you agree or not if its the right decision to prevent discrimination between women wearing headscarfs and who are not in the process of getting government jobs promoted or getting grades as students andor to prevent creating any concern of discrimination in the minds of people who receive the service Because significant percentage of Islamist people naturally without even thinking see headscarfed women as better muslims and has a bias that better muslims have higher morality so they couldshould be privileged Because of that notion and because you couldnt and shouldnt ban headscarfs from the public all together they thought this ban could at least minimize government based discrimination and any concern of discrimination of that kind Now the ban is over and after the referendum new laws and rules concerning publicservants are on the way which are going to weaken if not remove the jobsecurity of public servants bring lesstransparent and corruptable recruitment methods and promotion standards As a result naturally female publicservants who are not wearing head scarfs are one of the groups that feel under threat which is also an example of those discrimination concerns I tried to explain 3 The 2016 coup was not executed by secular Kemalists Theres an Islamist movement which began in 60s or 70s following a cult leader called Fethullah Gulen which slowly grew socially and ecconomicly by connecting with mainly religious conservative less educated and lowincome people of Turkey in the name of so called public service and Islam Provided scholarships for poor peoples kids helped their education tried to attract clever students to their schools and other educational structures Tried succeded in some degree to brainwash suitable religios oriented kids detected throughout their education with Gulens teachings making them believe they serve for a higher holly purpose Later canalized them into studying especially management law and other fields which are main branches recruited in the government Then tried to placeinfiltrate its followers who act as theyre not from the movement first in the critical duties which are related to recruitment promotion justice department intelligence and police then in time all around the government except military in some degree as military was more selective and also had strict disciplinary methods against possible cultist or Islamists The Gulen movements secrets and goals begin to be exposed by journalists secular politicians and those claims had decent media coverage in the late 90s and early 2000s Investigations began which caused Gulen to flee to USA but after AKP Erdogans party came to power in 2002 the allegations were quickly dropped and media coverage began to diminish except secular oppositions constant warning about the threat which AKP dismissed until 2014 or so In AKP ruling the Gulen movement became stronger and stronger in the government law and police force and in every field of governmental public service as AKP didnt have enough qualified people and built a partnership with them Also they passed laws that especially built a highway for Gulenists to rise in justice department They also managed to take control the government central exam system that recruits public servants and even military students Plus AKP constantly tried to weaken the military firewall I mentioned After Gulen had enough power in the police and justice department various antimilitary allegations investigations lawsuits began which ended up many military generals and highranked officers arrested using manifactured false evidence Although those evidence proven to be totally false and despite continous opposition warnings AKP supported those lawsuits for a long long time The imprisonement dismissal andor resignment of many generals and highranked officers opened a window for lowerranked secretly gulenist officers to rise in the military which they took and Gulen had a decent power in the military as a result After AKP and Gulen movement had some disagreements in 2014 their fight for power began First Gulenist tried to bring down Erdogan with corruption lawsuits about ministers and their sons including Erdogans son using the concrete evidence they easily collected during their partnership and government power But Erdoan managed to tear the lawsuits down quickly using his political power fiercely and creating a vast media propaganda campaign using the media who he slowly took control over the years After this attempt he tried to weaken Gulen by confiscating media owned by Gulen which fanatically supported Erdogan until their breakup by the way and Gulen controlled companies and a bank of Gulens which are thought to be the main financial sources of Gulen organization Then comes the Gulenist officers coup attempt who werent enough to control the whole military which is why the coup attempt failed not that Erdogan invited people to streets If the whole military joined the coup with full power and didnt hesitate to use fire power againts resistance not only in a few places but everywhere nobody could stop it There are many uncovered secrets and serious doubts about the coup too but I wont be going there in this post because it would be speculation 4 Now Erdoan declared Gulen organisation as a terrorist one which is actually justified and he is using the coup attempt and state of emergency laws to get rid of any opposition because it made a perfect excuse for him to fire andor jail people at will as there really were many Gulenists in the government and in every part of the community but public doesnt know who are He and his supporters can blame anyone being a secret Gulenist and that is now a major oppression method going on He already accused the opposition being a partner with Gulenists the same opposition who constantly warned him about the Gulen threat and always fought against Gulens false lawsuits during the referendum Unfortunately if hes elected the president with the new powers which he probably will be because he already controls the election system in the justice department which declared about 25 million illegal votes legal during the referendum the power will singlehandedly be his and the state of emergency laws will be the norm in the country Added Hours after I wrote this the very popular biggest secular opposition newspaper which always has been against Gulen organisation and fight against their false lawsuits and its owner and editors are under heavy investigation for supposedly helping Gulen organisation and trying to overthrow the government Their buildings are being searched by the police at the moment Probably I am next for writing this comment seriously,neutral

Dunkirk is a very different movie and not your standard war movie There is very little dialogue a very simple plot not much gore and almost no character development  I think I remember 1 characters name The movie is not for everyone because of how different it is and some will find it very boring That being said I really enjoyed it the sound was amazing and in every scene I felt completely immersed in what was happening I like how it show 3 different perspective of land air and sea and I like how the movie wasnt crazy long like other war movies If you havent seen it yet go into the movie expecting it to be different and you may or may not like it depending on what I mentioned,neutral

I had the pleasure of watching the film last Sunday at Phenomena cinema in Barcelona It was a 70mm showing with DTS audio Before the film began however one of the staff members a Director of Photography explained that Nolan himself had been to the cinema a couple of weeks before for a private showing and had calibrated the projector and audio to his liking His audio tastes were peculiar to say the least We were told that the volume we were going to experience was slightly lower than what Nolan requested due to how loud it was They were right every gunshot was deafening and the pacing of the film combined with the overwhelmingly loud soundtrack and immersive experience of the 70mm film made for an intense experience I was genuinely recoiled in my seat and physically recoiling with each gunshot,neutral
When you didnt know this was a thing but used it in FL Studio before Hey I understand everything now Really doesnt,neutral

The ticking was an amazing element to the score My favorite use of that motif was in the second season finale of Hannibal It gets subtly faster and faster throughout the entire episode It was brilliant,positive
I didnt find the film intense in fact except for some rather nice cinematography I thought that the film was pretty darn blah What was needed IMO is some footage of the defense of the Dunkirk perimeter by the French and remaining British troops The whole sequence of the troops in the barge as it was being machine gunned was too long  almost to the point of being boring The film had no buildup high point and finale I am glad that I saw it but would certainly not recommend it Who am I I am a retired combat cameraman with 26 months incountry cinematography experience in Vietnam during 19661971,neutral

This was actually a very good video very informative and very correct good job thanks for bringing this situation to the world 1 The poor didnt bring Chavez to power it was the middle class The poor didnt even vote in 1998 that came later on 2 Chavez didnt spend millions on social programs for the poor Social programs existed before Chavez he just destroyed them when he came to power so that the government didnt have those expenses But then in a moment in time when he was unpopular he created social programs again this is when he brought the poor into the voting system and threw some money at them at this point oil prices were high so he could do that and still STEAL millions The social programs created by Chavez wereare HIGHLY inefficient zero transparency a lot of money goes into them and most of it disappears without yielding real world results other than propaganda 3 When Chavez was in government he didnt do any of those things because of good management he just had so much money oil went from 11 to 150 during his time in office that he could steal a lot and also give some back to the country Chavezs daughter is one of the richest persons in latin America 4 Chavez made the people dependent on the government He stole most of the privately owned companies in the country that actually produced and exported goods and then ran them to the ground because of unqualified workers taking over He had so much oil income that he basically gave very cheap dollars to new companies many from his friends to import goods instead of producing them here bringing Venezuelan companies to bankruptcy the ones he didnt steal He single handedly destroyed the country its just that Maduro is paying for it because oil prices went down on his watch 5 Updated black market rate is 17000 per dollar And the official rate for friends and family is 10 imagine how much money you can generate with that exchange system 6 Luisa Ortega Diaz is not an opposition leader more like a government defector that starting opposing it for her own political agenda She is as corrupt and disgusting as the ones currently in government but hey if you want to jump ship we will welcome you UPDATE 8 months later May 2018 you need to pay 950000 for a single dollar And it is expected to rise rapidly in the coming months,neutral

video was too long Halfway through it I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich But then I found out that Im out of mayonnaise so I went to a store There I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life But Im really a shy person so I took up a threeyear personality development course so I can introduce my self She was very friendly and all but unfortunately she has a boyfriend So I said all good Im a mature person I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend so I did not bother her anymore But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her Then she broke up with her boyfriend we drank some alcohol because of it I told her shell be fine and I wished her well I still think shes the most beautiful woman in the world but like I said I am over my crush on her It was like five seconds already when I first saw her Besides I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her It was more important than a crush So we kept hanging out drinking having coffee and all I had a girlfriend she started dating other guys My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it so I said okay I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately But we were really drunk so she spent the night in my apartment I only have one bed so you know what that means She took the bed and I slept on the couch But on the couch I really cant sleep Something was bothering me So I tossed and turned for about three hours then I finally cant take it anymore I stood up and went straight to my room where shes sleeping I approached the bed gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me She stirred and woke up She asked whats up I told her you know the first time I saw you I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video She said you know what Ive been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer So we opened that drawer and lo and behold theres my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it,positive

"When I was a kid we had a neighbor who moved away and was so irresponsible as to abandon five pregnant female cats We took them all in and they all delivered their litters within the same week We blocked off the largest room in the house and turned it over to the kittens for the most adorable chaos ever Our house was mostly an open plan house so we didnt have a door on the wide entrance to the den which was the largest room and instead blocked it off with a closet door that was taken off its hinges and laid on its side across the portal Well one particularly adventurous kitten whom I called Patches because he was white with gray spots learned how to get over that door and then taught the rest of them the trick So we got a sheet of plywood that was taller than the door had been wide They got over that So we got a new sheet of plywood that was so tall we had to cut a door into it like at an ice hockey rink and they still got over it Finally we topped it with plexiglass cementing the appearance of this room to a hockey rink and they couldnt get over that But they tried

Patches was also the first to learn how to climb the curtains First he got halfway and then mewed until someone got him down Then he got all the way to the top of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then he walked to the other side of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then the most worrying thing happened he stopped mewing because hed discovered the secret of how to slide down the curtains with his claws out One day I came into the den and saw him leading a line of six other kittens across the curtain rod all of them to end their journey the same way by shredding the curtains We kept them for six months until they could be weaned had them all neutered and given a checkout and then gave all but six away from approximately two dozen after personally interviewing each prospect Then we got rid of the curtains the carpet and replaced all the furniture It was horrendously timeconsuming and expensive but Im proud of my parents for not just leaving the pregnant cats or turning them over to a shelter",neutral

I watched a documentary about cats that showed why people in early days considered the cats to be evilOne of the reason for them to hate cats was because the female mated with several male cats to get pregnant and would have a single litter of kittens from different fathersThey termed this behaviour sinful and hence cats would get torturedI pity the fools who want animals to act like humans and have the same standard of loyalty and monogamyCats are cats not birdsdogs and horses etcRespect the individuality and treat every animal with the respect they deserve,neutral

Hi as a bird person I just want to clarify most birds dont pair for life Some parrots and birds of prey do  penguins certainly do not despite the well known documentary  they may choose the same mate for a few years but then they may not Male birds are male and will essentially mate with anything that lets it and females will mate with the male with the flashiest plumage beautiful song or best nest The exception is in situations where teamwork is essential like birds of prey who have vast territories  in those situations they are monogamous Love your work Simon,neutral

"I had a wonderful cat Miss Kitty was his name I was 6 years old and the name stuck Behaviorally he acted like a female he would clean up after his brother Fat Cat when he refused to cover his waste in the litter box 

Glaring at Fat Cat the whole time as if saying You are nasty and many other weird mannerisms that reenforced the thinking that secretly Miss Kitty believed he was a girl

That cat slept on the same bed as me and pillow from the day I got him I had a lot of nightmares and he helped keep them away

I know Miss Kitty loved me as much as I loved him Sadly I dont think I will find another pet and friend as awesome as Miss Kitty 

Im 24 now and to my sorrow Miss Kitty passed away on the night before Thanksgiving last year I stay with him until he was gone He had gone blind earlier that night but he had already been deaf for a few years 

Miss Kitty saved me from my nightmares and made my life a lot better There was now way I was not going to let him pass on alone I loved him too much I know in my heart that Miss Kitty loved me too",neutral

"If anyones interested in how claw machines are rigged heres some interesting factoids
Claw machines are designed to slowly grab tighter over a certain number of goes So say its set to a 30go cycle after 30 goes the claw will grab as tight as it ever grabs and this is usually when people win After that it will slowly get weaker before getting stronger again on another 30go cycle So if you can watch people play a claw machine for long enough you should be able to work out how long the cycle is based on when people win and then you can work out the best times to play to win

Or you could actually enjoy your life and just play it straight away and if you dont win you dont win",positive

Doesnt the clown return every 27 years in the book The last move came out in 1990 its 2017 27 years later,neutral
The new clown is obviously evil dark and creepy The 90s clown looks more like a regular clown he can even look like a nice guy simply dressed up and the fact that you could believe someone was all nice and then turn into such a monster is way scarier than seeing something dangerous and knowing you dont get near it,neutral
"cool fact

I think my problem with the new IT movie is that according to the book ITs Pennywise form wasnt supposed to be scary looking Pennywise was supposed to be the form that it used to lure kids sort of like the nice looking guy in the park looking for his lost dog that turns out to be a kidnapper The new Pennywise wouldnt do that he looks creepy when you first see him,neutral

I have sleep paralysis Nothing but that scares me,neutral

417 Tim Curry is a national treasure yeah but not an american one Hes from England ,neutral
holy mother of sweet god pearl,positive
The new clown looks like the villain from the incredibles movie to me,neutral
seriously irritating that everyone keep calling IT a remake its a faithful adaption of Kings Novel,negative
The whole reason the original trailer wasnt scary is because back in the day they didnt give away so much crap that you know whats going on They left people wondering so theyd watch to find out whats happening Now we know darned near everything about a movie before its ever released so they have to hype up the scarycreepy because otherwise theres not much there but of course with this its a remake so it doesnt matter its all about effects,neutral
The original clown is definitely scarier,neutral
Everyone loves when they remake movies *cough* Ghostbusters *cough,neutral
I wonder how many people know that Pennywise that creepy as clown is actually a spider,neutral
Why do they even call him Pennywise the Dancing Clown Ive never seen him dance before not until I saw TerrorDance ft DJ Pennywise,neutral

this movie left me with a trauma when i was 7 20 years later and i still wont go anywhere near rain gutters,neutral
original is creepier to me the new one doesnt even look like the original one from the first movie the real reason that I think hes creepy is that you cant tell if hes evil or not because if you look from a far he looks normal but when you get close you know your going to get F*CKED xD,neutral
Have them react to the it trailer but its the cat in the hat,neutral
lol I once knew a guy through a friend that was terrified of clowns After their drama club rehearsal ended they all went to Dennys and I tagged along From our town to Dennys its a half hour drive While getting there I found out he was afraid of clowns so I said we all float down here in a gravely voice as a joke Bad idea He was driving and pulled over insisting I gtfo It took ten minutes for my friend and others to calm him down,neutral

I think that the movie will either be amazing or a complete mess The original is iconic because of Tim Curry solely He was the main character and he was in fact much more of a monster due to him tricking the children by his initial actions This one seems like its just some regular mediocre monster film Tim Burtons performance as Pennywise actually held some true character and personality,neutral
LMAO When the guy said What after the film scene the word What appeared on screen and I thought it was edited in for a sec,neutral

I genuinely think from the photos that Tim Curry clown is scarier Not because Im one of those ooooh the original is always better hipster types but just because bottom looks like Chucky from the sequels while top is closer to human looking but his eyes are soulless and teeth are terrifying Sure bottom one looks more evil but top one just looks like the interdimensional demon he is more than evil Beyond evil Im sure overall the new movie will be scarier in terms of atmosphere but lordy the clownier Pennywise looks the scarier he really is,neutral
